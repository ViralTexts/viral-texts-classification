it, but give his own explanation of the
mixexi-up condition ot bis kinsfolk in
his own words. He says, "" I married
a widow who had a grown-up daughter.
My father visited our house very often,
fell in love with my stepdaughter, and
married her. So my father became
my son-in-law, and my stepdaughter
my mother, because she was uiy father's
wife. Some time afterwards, my wife
gave birth to a son ; he was my father's
brother-in-law, and my uncle, tor tie
was the brother of my step-mother.
My father's wife L . my step-daughter
had also a son ; he was, of course,
my brother, aud in the mean time my
grandchild, for he was the son of my
daughter. My., wife was my grand
mother, because she was my mother's
mother. ' I was my wife's husband and
the grandchild at the same time. And
as the husband of a person's grand
mother is his grandfather, I was my
own grandlatner. Alter tins lojncai
conclusion, we are not surprised tha,t
the unfortunate man should have taken
refuge in oblivion. It was the most
married family and the worst mixed
that we ever heard of. To unravel
such an entangling alliance could not
have resulted otherwise than in an aber-
ation of mind and subsequent suicide.

From the most important transaction in
comnmerce down to the particular style in
which you tie a string around a bundle, obey
orders. Do not get easily disgusted. Wihile
othellrs in the store may lounge, or fret, or
complain, you go with ready hands, and
cheerful face, and contented spirit to your
,vork. Wihen the bugle sounds, tie good
soldier asks no questions, but shoulders his
knapsack, fills his canteen and listens to the
command of ""March l"" Do not get tile idea
that your interest and those of your em­
ployer are antagonistic., His success will be
your honor. His embarrassment will be your
dismay. Expose none of the frailties of the
firm. Tell no store secrets. Do not blab.
Rebuff those iersons wihole come to find out
from clerks what ought never be known out­
side the store. Do not be among those young
men who take on a mysterious air when
something is said against the firm that em.
ployes them, as much as to say:
""I could tell you some things if I would,but
I won't.""
Do not be amona those who imagine they
can Duild themselves up by pulling somebody
else down. Be not ashamed to be a subal­
tern.
UNLAWFUL DEMANDS OF EMPLOYERS.
Again, I counsel clerks in this house to
search out what are the unlawful and dis­
honest demands of an establlshmen t and re­
sist them. In the 6,000 years that have
passed there has never been an occasion
when it was one's duty to sin against God. It
is never right to do wrong. If tile head' men
of tile firm expect of you dishonesty, disap­
point thsem.
""O0,"" you say, ""I should lose mny place
then;""
Better lose your place than your soul. But
you will not lose your place. Christian hero­
snm is always honored. You go to the head
man of your store, and say:­
""Sir. I want to serve you; I want to oblige
you; it is from no lack of industry on my
part,butthis thing seems to mle to be wrong,
and it is a sin against my conscience, it is a
sin against God, and I beg you, sir, to excuse
me.""
He may flush up and swear, but he will cool
down, and hle will have more admiration for
you than for those wholu submit to his evil dic­
tation; add while they sink, you will rise.
Do not, because of seeming temporary ad­
vantage, give up your character,young man.
Under God, that is tile only thing you have to
bulid on. 'lve up that, you give up every­
thing. That employer asks a young man
to hlurt himself for time and for eternity,
who expects him to make a wrong entry, or
change an invoice, or say goods cost so much
when they cost less; or impose upon tile
verdancy of a customer, or misrepresent a
style of tabric. flow dare he demand of you
anything so insolent?
A BAD FEATURE OF DRUMMING.
There is one style ot temptatiou tlat comes
on a great many of our clerks, and that is
upon those who are engaged in what is
called ""arumming."" Now, that occupation
is just as honorable as any other, if it be
conducted in accord with one's conscience.
In this day, when there are so many rival­
ries In business, all our commercial estab­
l1.hments ought to have men aboard who
are seeking out for opportunities of mer­
chandise. There can be no objection to
that. But there are professed Christian
merchants in the week-nighlt prayer-meet­
lng who have clerks abroad in New York,
conducting merchants of Cincinnati, and
Chicago, and St. Louis throughl the debauch­
eries of the great town, In order to secure
their custom for the store. There are
in stores in New York and Brook­
lyn drawers In which there are
kept. moneys which the clerks are
to go to and get whatever they want to con.
Ouct tiese people thlroughl the dissipations of
the city. The head men of the dril wink at
it, add in some places actually demand it­
professed Christian merchants. One would
tllink that tile prayer would freeze on their
lips and they would fail back dead at thle
-sound of their own song. What chance is
there for young men when commercial es­
tablishimentssexpect such thllings of them?
Among all thlings infernal I pronounce that
the most daninable. Young man, how will
that firm treat you when you are utterly de­
spoiled and dragged out wlt.h sin, going
throuzh thle lhaunts of Iniquity for the pur­
pose of getting customers for their store?
How will tiley treat ou? O, they will glive
you a penssion i They will Oulld you a fine
house! Tlley will get you a horse and car­
riage! Wll they? No. Nome day you wvillgo
to - the Store, shabby, litoxlcated, worn out
in their service, and tiey will say:
""John, you are a disgrace to our house.
Now, just look atv yourself. Accountant, how
1luclh do we OWe this man?''
''A dollar aild thirty cents'.""
""Well, now, here-here It Is, $1.30. Go off.
Don't be hanging around the store.""
IMagnanimity superb! Tlhey stole tlhe
luster from his eye, and thie color. Irolln is
cheek, ant the honor from his soul, and then
they lkicked him out. If suchll professed
Christian merchants do not go straight to
hell, I don't know any use of having such a
place. 0, young men, disappoint the expeC­
tation of that firm; disapjolunt those custom­
ers if these things are expected of you, You
may sell an extra case of goods, you may sell
an extra roll of silk, but the. trouble is you
may have to throw your soul to boot in the
bargain.
CONSIDERATION FOR CUSTOMERS.
Again, I counsel all clerk, to conquer the
trials of thteir particular position. One great
trial for clerks is the inconsideration of cus­
tomers. There are people who are entirely
polite everywllere else, but gruff and dicta­
torial and contemptible when tlly come into
a store to buy anytlung. There are thousands
of men and women who go from store to
store to price things, without any Idea of
purchase. They are not satistled until every
roll of goods is nrought down, and they haye
pointed out all tilhe real or imaginary defects.
They try on all kinds or kid gloves and
stretch them out of shape, and they
put on all styles of cloak and walk to
the mn'ror to see hlow iv . would look,
and then they sail out of the store,
saying: ""I will not take it to-day;"" which
means: ""I don't want it at all,"" leaving the
clerl amid a confusion of ribbons, and laces,
and cloths, to smooth out l500 worth of goods
-not one cent of which did lthat nman or
woman buy or expect to buy. Now Icall thlt
a dishonesty on the part of'the customer. It
a boy runs into a store and takes a roll of
clotl off the counter and sneaks out into the
street, you all join in the cry pell-mell:
'""Suop thiefl"" When I see you go Into a
stops not expecting to buy anything but to
price things, stealing the time of the clerk
and stealing the time of his employer, I say,
too: ""Stop thief I"" If I were asked whlllc
class of 'ersons most need the grace of God
amid their annoyances, I would say: ""Dry
goods clerks."" All tie indignation of custo­
mers about thme highll prices comes on the
clerk. For instance: A great war comes.
The manufactories are closed. The people go
off to battle. The price of goods runs up. A
customer comes into .a store. Goods hhve
gone no.
'""Iow much Is that worth.?""
""A dollar.""
""A dollar! Outrageous. A dollar!""
Wily, who Is to blame for the fact thati It
has got to be a dollar? Does the Indlgna'aon
go out to the manufacturers on the banks of
the Mlerrimac, because they have closed up?
No. Does the indignation go out toward the
employer, who s outlat his country seat, No.
It comes on the clerk, ie got up the warl
He levied tile taxes I lie puts up the rents!
Of course it's the clerk! .
TIlE PAIHSIMORIOUS SIDE.
Then a great trial comes to clerks in the
fact that they see the parslmonlouis side of
human nature. You. talk about liles behind
the counter-there are just as many lies be­
fore the counter. Augustine speaks of a mhn
who advertised that he would, on a certain
occasion, tell the people whllat was in their
hearts. A great crowd assembled, and he
stepped to the front and said:
""I will tell you what is In your hearts: To
buy cheap and sell dear!""
O, people of Brooklyn, lay not aside your
urbanity when you come Into a store. Treat
the clerks like gentlemen ana ladles-prov­
ing yourself to be a gentleman or a lady.
lRemember, that If the prices are high and
your purse Is lean, that is no fault of the
clerks. And if you have a son or a daughter
amid those perplexities of commercial life.
and such a one comes home all worn out, be
lenient, and know that the martyr at the
stake no more certainly needs the grace of
God than our young people a mi, the seven­
times heated exasperations of a clerk's life.
Then there are all tihe trials which cme to
clerks from the treatment of inconsiderate
employers. Tlhere are professed Christian
men in this city wheo have no more regard for
their clerks than they have for the scales on
which the sugars are weighted. A clerk is no
more than so much store furniture. No con­
sideration for their rights or their interests.
Not one word of encouragement from sunrise
to sunset, nor from January to December.
But when anything goes wrong-a streak of
dust on the counter, or a box with the cover
off-thuunder showers of Scolding. Men im­
perlous; capricious, cranky towards their clerks-their whole manner as much as to
say:
""All the interest I have in you is to see
what I can get out of you.""
INSUFFICIENT EVIDEiNCE.
Then there are all the trials of incompetent
wages. Some of you remnenmber when the
war broke out and all nmerchandise went up,
and merchants were made millionaires In
six months by the simple rise in the value of,
goods. Did the clerk get advantage of tllat
rise? Sometimes, nottalways. Isaw estates
gathered In those times over which tile
curce of God has hung ever since. The cry
of unnaid men and women in those stores
reached the Lord of. Sabaoth, and the inalg­
nation of God has been around those estab­
lishments ever since; rumbling in the car­
riage wheels,. flashing In the chandeliers,
'glowing from the crimson upholstery, thun­
dering in the long roll of the ten-pin alley.
Such men may bulld up palaces of merchan­
dise heaven iligh, but after awhile a disaster
will come, andl will piut one hand on this pil­
lar, and another hand on that pillar, and
tllrow itself forward until down will come
tile whole structure, crushing the worshipers
as grapes are mashed in a wine-press.
Then there are boys In establishments who
are rulned--in prosperous establishments­
ruined by their lack of compensation. In
how many prosperous stores it has been for
the last twenty years that boys were given
just enough money to learn them how to
steall Some were seized upon by the police.
The 'vast majority or instances were not
known. The head of tile firm asked:
""Where is George now?""
""'', he isn't here any more.""
A lad nmight better starve to death on a
blastea heath than take one cent from his
employer. Woe he to that employer who un­
necessarily puts a temptation In aboy's way.
There have been great establishments in
these cities buliiueg marble palaces, their
owners dying worth millions and millions
and millions, who made a vast amount of
their estate out of the blood, and muscle,and
nerve o5 half-paid clerks. Such men as­
well, 1 will not' mention any name. But I
mean men who have gathered up vast estates
at the expense of the people who were ground
under their heel.
""Oh,"" say such merchants, ""if you don't
like it here, then go and get a bettor place.""
As much as to say:
''I've got you in my trip, and I mean to
hold you; you can't get any other place.""
A CONTRAST IN E.MIPLOYIERS.
O, what a contrast we see bets eon such
men and those Christian merchants of Brook­
lyn and New York who to-day are sympa­
tlletic with their clerks-when they pay the
salary, acting in tills way:
""Tills salary that I give you is not all my
interest in you. You are an immortal man;
you are an imnmortal woman; I am interested
in your present and youreveriasting welfare;
I want you to understand that if I am a little
higher up in this store, I am beside you in
Cbristian sympathy.""
Go back forty years to Arthur Tappen's
store in Now York-a man whose worst one­
mles never questioned his honesty. Every
imorning, he brought all the clerks, and the
accountanllts, and tile weiglhers into a rootm
for devotions. They sang. They prayed.
Thfy exliorted. On Monday morning the
clerks were asked where they had atttended
church on tihe eprevious day, and what the
sermons were about. It must have sounded
strangely, that voice of praise along the
streets where the devotees of mammon were
counting their golden beads. You say Arthur
Ta: pen failed. Yes, he was unfortunate,
like a great many good men; but I understand
hlie met all his obligations before he left this
world, and I know that he died in the peace
of the gospel, atnd that he is before the tihrone
of God today-forever blessed. If that be
falling, I wish that you may all fall. There
are a great many young men In this city­
yea, in this house-wiho want a word ,L
encouragement, Clristian encouragement.
One smile of good cheer would be worth more
to them to-morrow morning In their places
of business than a present of $50,000 ten years
hence.
A THIRILLING MEMIORY.
0, I remember tihe appreolhension and the
tremor of entering a profession. I remember
very well the lman who greeted me in the ec­
clesiastical court with the tip ends of tihe
loug fingers of the left hand; and I remem­
ber the other man w!lo took my hand in both
of iris and said:
""God bless you, my brother; you have en­
tered a glorious profession; be faithful to
God and he will see you through.""
Why, I feel this minute the thrill of that
hand-shaking, thoudh the mani who gave me
the Christian grip has been in heaven twenty­
five years. There are old men to-day who
can look back to forty years ago, when some
one said t'kind word to them. Now, old men,
pay back what you go, then. It is a great
art for old men to be able to encourage tile
young. There are many young people in our
cities who have come from inland counties of
our own State, from the granite hills of the
North, from thle savan tas of tile Souttt, from
the prairies of the W\est. They are here to
got their fortune. They are In boarding­
I houses where everybody seems to be tillln;­
ing of himself. They want companionship
anti they want Christian encouragement.
Give it to them.
A WORD TO CLERKS.
My wordlis to all .clerks in this house: Be
mInghtier tlan your temptations. A Santi­
uwiclt
Islander used to think wlhe he slew an
uenemy all the strenem.th of that enemy came
into his own right arm. And I have to tell
you that every misfortune you conquer is so
iiunlch adtdea to your inoral nIower. W\itll om­
nlpotence for a lever and tile throne of God
for a fulcrum, you can lnove earth, and
heavei. While iliere are othler young men
putting the cup of sin to tlselr lips, stoolp
down and tldrlnk out of tle fountains of God,
anud you will rise un strong to tlhresh thle
mountains. The ancients used to think that
pearls we're fallen rlmindrops witich, touching
tlhe surface of tile sea, hardened luto gems,
titen rtoppeDi to tle bottoit. I have to tell
you to-nay that stormns of trial have shot ered
liuperlslabla pearl into manty a young man's
lap. O, young mnan! while you have goods
tosell, renember you have a soul to save.

into which I call you, young man, to-day.

First in the field, as becomes so great a teacher, Mr
Punch warns us of another year's advent; showing

a few more years are over, and when the railway

that evening, and handing her things at supper in the most
devoted manner. From that period commenced the inti­
macy between them which terminated in this morning's
catastrophe.
I "" Poor Pinkney had barely attained to his twenty-eighth
year ; bht there is reason to believe that but for reasons of
a pecuniary nature, his single life would have come earlier
to an untimely end. A change for the better, however,
having occurred in his circumstances, the young lady's
friends were induced to sanction his addresses, and thus to
become accessories to the course for which he had just
sliffered.
"" The unhappy man passed the last night of his bachelor
existence in his solitary chamber. From half-past eight to
ten he was busily engaged in writing letters. Shortly after
ten o'clock, his younger brother Henry knocked at the
door, when the doomed youth told him in a firm voice to
come in. On being asked when he meant to go to bed, he
r6plied, ' Not yet.' The question was then put to him how
he thought he should sleep; to which his answer was, II
don't know.' lie then expressed a desire for a cigar and a
glass of grog, which were supplied him. His brother, who
sat down and partook of the like refreshment, now de­
manded if he would want anything more that night. He
said, 'Nothing,' in a firm voice. His affectionate brother
thren rose to take leave; when the devoted one consider­
ately advised him to take care of himself.
"" Precisely at a quarter of a minute to seven, the next
morning,the victim of Cupid, having been called according
to his desire, rose and promptly dressed himself. He had
the self-control to shave himself without the slightest in­
jury; for not even a scratch upon his chin appeared after
the operation. It would seem that he bad devoted a longer
time to his toilet than usual.
A The wretched individual was attired in a light blue
dress-coat with frosted metal buttons, a white waistcoat and
nankeen trousers, with patent leather boots. He wore
round his neck a variegated satin scarf, which partially con­
cealed the Corazza of his bosom. In front of the scarf
,was inserted a breast-pin of very conspicuous dimensions.
Having descended the staircase with a quick step, he en­
tered the apartment where his brother and a few friends
were awaiting him. He shook hands cordially with all
present; and on being asked how he had slept, answered
'Very well-' and to the farther demand as to his state of
mind, he said ' He felt happy.'
"" Oone of the party having hereupon suggested that it
would be as well to take something before the melancholy
ceremony was gone through, he exclaimed with some em­
phasis, 'Decidedly.' Breakfast was accordingly served;
when he ate the whole of a French roll, a large round of
toast, two sausages, and three new-laid eggs, which he
washed doswn with two great breakfast-cups of tea. In re­
ply to an expression of astonishment on the part of a per­
son present, at his appetite, he declared that he never felt
it .hsartier in his life.
H Having inquired the time, and ascertained that it was
ten minutes to eleven, he remarked that ' It would soon be
over.' His brother then inquired itfhe could do anything
for him; when he said le should like a glass ofale. Hav­
ing drunk this, he appeared satisfied.
9 The fatal moment now approaching, he devoted the re­
lnaining brief portion of his time to distributing among his
friends those little articles which he would soon no longer
want. To one he gave his cigar-case, to another his to­
bacco-stopper, and he charged his brother Henry with his
latch-key, with instructions to deliver it, after all was over,
with due solemnity to his landlady. I
Iso ""'e clock at length struck eleven; and at the same
moment he9 was informed that a cab was at the door. He
merely said, ' I-am ready,' and allowed himself to be con­
ducted to the vehicle ; into which he got with his brother­
his friends following in two others.
"" Arrived at the tragical spot, a short but anxious delay
of some seconds took place; after which they were joined
by the lady with her friends. Little was said on either
side: but Miss Gale, with customary decorum, shed tears.
Pinkney endeavoured to preserve a composure; but a slight
twitching of his mouth and eyebrows proclaimed his inward
,agitation. , s d.lr:f~ wol i
I The ill-starred bachelor having submitted quietly to
bate a large white bow pinned to his button-hole, now
waliced, side by side with Miss Gale, with a firm step to the
altar, e surveyed the imposing preparations with calm­
ness; aiid gazed, unnmoved, on the clergyman, who, as­
sisred by tole clerk, was waiting behind the railings.
"" All requisite preliminaries having now been settled,
and the piescribed melancholy formalities gone through, the
uasal question nas put, '
Wilt thou have this woman for
thy vile ?' To which the rash youth replied, in a distinct
voice, ' I will.' He then put the fatal ring upon Miss Gale's
finve^; the hymneneal noose was adjusted; and the poor
fellew was launched into matrimony.""

who is now nearing Australia on
his round the world journey, has selected
a* the subject for bis sermon
through the press today ' The Royal
Garden,"" the text being taken from
Solomon's SoDg v, 1 ""I am come Into
my garden.""
The world has bad a great many beau Li­

fill gardens. Charlemagne added to tne ^
glory of his reign by decreeing that they *
be established all through the realm?
decreeing even the names ot the fbwers
to he planted there. Henry 1Y, at
Moatpellier, established gardens of be- a
witching beauty and luxuriance, h
gathering into them Alpine, Pjrenean b
and French plants. One of the sweet- b
ests spots on earth was the warden of 1
Shenstone, the poet. His writings have c
made bnt little impression on the world, b
bat his garden, ""The Leasowcs,"" will ii
be immortal. To the natural advantage
ot that place was brought the perfection (
of art. Arbor and terrace and slope and fi
rustic temple and reservoir and urn and ii
fountain here and their crown'mg. Oik f]
and yew and hazel put firth their richest
foliage. There was no life more diligent. I
no sonl more ingenious than that of Shen­
stone, and all that diligence and genius b
were brought to th*. adornment of that 41
ODe treasured 3pot. He gave ?300 for *
it. He sold it for ?17,000. y
And yet I am to tell you of a richer c
garden than any I have mentioned, It ii
is the gardjn of the church, it is the e
garden spoken of in my text, which be ii
lengs to Christ, for my text says so. v
TT? hnnaht ifc: he rdanted it. he owns it. e

and bo shall have it. Walter Scott, in b
his outlay at Abbotsford, ruined his for- a
tune. And now in 'the crimson flowers o
of those gardens you can almost think or b
imagine that you see the blood of tbei old J
man's broken heart. The payment of v
the last ?100,000 sacrificed him. But I h
have to tell you that Christ's life and c
Christ's death were the outlay of this v
beautiful garden of the church of which e
my text speaks. Oh, bow, many sighs e
and tears and pangs and agonies! Tell U
me, ye women who saw him hang! Tell I
me, ye executioners who lifted him and k
let him down! Tell me, thou sun thai ti
didst hide ye rocks that fel.! ""Christ k
loved the church and gave himself for tl
it."" If, then, the garden of the church t!
belongs to Christ, certainly he has a b
right to walk in it. Come, then, O s
blessed Jesua, this morning, walk up tl
and down these aisles and pluck what e
:U

lauu win, ui oncoiucBo ivi buypcxi*. ?i
The church, in my text, is appropriate- C
ly compared to a warden, because it is a a
place of choice flowers, select fruits and tl
of thorough irrigation. fi
That would be a strange garden in ii
which there were no flowers. If nowhere b
else, they will be a long the borders or at fl
the gateway. The homeliest taste will a
dictate somethiug, if it be the oid fash- t

then you will find the Mexican cactus e:

Tlie moudi, like die eyes, gives occasion
to so many tender thoughts, and is so apt to
lose and supersede itself in the affectionate
softness of its effect upon us, that the first
impulse, in speaking of it, is to describe it
by a sentiment and a transport. Sir John
Suckling, in his taste of an under lip, U
not to ne surpassed :
""Her lipe were red, and one was thin.
Compared with that was next her chin.
Sotne nee had stung it newly.""
The upper lip. observe, was only compara­
tively thin. Thin lips become none hut
shrews or niggards. A rosiness beyond that
of the cheeks, and a good-tempered suffi­
ciency and plumpness, are the indispensa­
ble requisites of a good mouth. Chaucer,
a great judge, is very peremptory in this
matter :
""With pregnant lippes, thick lo kins percese;
For lippes thin, not fat, but ever lean.
They aenre of naught; they be not worth a
bean;
For if the base bo full, there is dlight.""
Tkt Ccmrt s re.
For the consolation, however, of diosc
who have thin lips and are not shrews or
niggards, we must give it here as our opin­
ion, founded on what we have observed,
that lips become more or less contracted in
the course of years, iu proporu'on as they
are accustomed to express good humor and
generosity, or peevishness and a contracted
mind. Kemark the effect which a moment
of ill-temper or grudgingness has upou the
lips, and judge what may be the effect of
an habitual series of such moments. Re­
mark the reverse, and make a similar judg­
ment. The mouth is die frankest part of
the face. It can the least conceal the feel­
ings. We can hide neither ill-temper with
it nor good. We may affect what we please,
but affectation will not help us. In a wrong
cause it will only make our observers re­
sent the endeavor to impose urion them.
The mouth is the seat of one class of emo­
tions as die eyes are of another ; or rather,
it expresses die same emotions, but in a
greater detail, and with a more irrepressible
tendency to mobility. It is the region of
smiles and dimples, of a trembling tender­
ness, of sharp sorrow, of a full and breath­
ing joy, of candor, of reserve, of a carking
care, of a liberal sympathy. The mouth,
out of its many sensibilities, may be fancied
throwing up one great expression into die
eyes, ns many lights in the city reflect a
broad lustre into the heavens. On the other
hand, the eyes may be supposed the chief
movers, influencing the smaller details of
their companion, as heaven influences earUi.
The first cause in both is internal and deep­
seated.The more we consider beauty, the more
we recognize its dependence on sentiments.
The handsomest mouth, without expression,
is no better than a mouth in a drawing-book.
An ordinary man, on the other hand, with
a great deal of expression, shall become
charming. One of the handsomest smiles
we ever saw in a man was that of a cele­
brated statesman who is reckoned plain.

THE COST OF A TitAlX.
At the time when the first open court
of law was established ia llusaia, a lady,
dressed with the utmost elegance, was
walking oa the Moscow promenade,
leaning upon her hus-band's arm, and
letting the long train of her rich dress
sweep the dust and dirt of the street, i
A young officer, coming hastily from I
a side 6treet, was so careless as to catch
one of Lis spurs in the ludy's train, and'
in an inst ant a great piece was torn out
of the costly but frail material of the
dress.
I beg a thousand pardons, ma­
dame,"" said the officer, with a polite
bow, and then was about passing on,
when he was detained by the lady's hus­
band.""You have insulted my wife.""
""Nothing' was further from my in­
tention, sir. Your wife's long dress is
to blame for the accident, which I sin­
cerely regret, and I beg you once more
to receive my apologies for any care­
lessness on my part.1' Thereupon he
attempted to hasten on.
You shall not escape so,"" said the
lad-, with her head thrown back in a
spirited way. ""To-day is the first time
1 have worn this dress, and it cost two
hundred rubles, which you must make
good.'1
"" Sly dear madame, I beg you cot to
detain me. I am -obliged to go on duty
;it once. As to the two hundred rubles
I really can not help the length of your
dress, yet I beg your pardon for not
having been more cautious."" -
"" You shall not stir, sir. That you
are obliged to go on duty is nothing to
us. My wife is right; the dress innsT
be made good.""
The oflicer' face grew pale.
"" You force me to break through tie
rules of the service,"" and I shair receive
putiihment.""
"" Pay the two hundred rubles and you
are free.""
The uick!y changing color in ihe
young man's face betrayed how inward­
ly disturbed he was; but stepping close
up to them both, he said, with apparent
self-oommand, ,
You will renounce your claim when
I tell you that I am a a poor nan.
who has nothing to live on but his offi
cer's pay, and the amount of that pay
hardly reaches the sum of two hundred
rubles in a whole year. I can, there­
fore, inake.no aiuenfe for Uxj iiiif for­
tune"", except ty again begging your
pardon."" . i - - . - -
""Oh! anybody could say all that;
b?t wa'il soc if It's true;, we'll ftraCout
if you have nothing but your pay. I de­
clare myself not satisfied with'your ex­
cuse?, and I demand my money,"" per­
sisted the lady, in the hard voice of a
thoroughly unfeeling woman.
"" That is true you are right,"" the
husband added, dutifully supporting
fler. "" By good luck we have the open
court now just in session. Go with us
before the Judge and he will decide the
matter.""
Ail further protestation on the officer's
part that he was poor, that he was ex­
pected oa duty, and so forth, did not
help matters. Out of respect for his
uniform, and to avoid an open scene,
he had to go with them to the court­
room, where ' the gallery was densely
packed with a crowtlbf people. ''
After waiting some time, the lady had
leave to make her complaint.
"" What have you to answer to this
complaint?"" said the Judge, turning to
the officer, who seemed embarrassed
and half ia despair. '
""On the whole, very little. As the
lateness of the hour, and being required
on duty, compelled me to hurry, I did
not notic this lady's train, which was

dragging o the ground, i I caught one
of my spurs Vn It, and had the misfor­
tune to tear the dress. Madame would
not receive my excises, but perhaps now
she might fiJicrst more disposed to
forgiveness, when I again declare, so
help me Ood,rthat I ccjrmnittd this
awkward! blurfdor ywillioul any 'mis

chievous intention, and I earnestly beg
that 6he will pardon me.""
A murmnr ran through Ihe gallery,
evidently from the peopi taking sides
with the defendant, and ajainst long
trains ia' general and the lady in par
ticular.' . - M i
The Judge called to order, and asked,
""Are you sati-ilied with the defendant's
explanation?"" ' ;
"" Xot at all satisfied. I demand two
hundred rubles in payment for my torn
dress."" .
"" Defendant, will you pay this sum?""
"" I would 4bW- fHtiti it -long httiure
this had I beep a position rto do eo.
Unfortunately I, am poor. My pay as
an officer Is all I hate to live on.""
""You hear, -couipriinant, that the
defendant is iiot able to pay the sum
you demand of him. Do you still wish
the complaint Jo stand?!.1 .
An unlJrVken stillness reigned
throughout the hall, and the young
officer '$ ht evth could be heard coming
hard. '.. M
' I wish it to stand. The law shall
give me jny jrighis."" , .. ... . ,
There tan through the rows of people
a mnnnar'of indignation that sounded
like a rushing of water.
"" Consider, complainant, the eonse-
quencesof your demand. The defend­
ant can be punished only through being
deprived of his ""personal liberty, and by
that you could obtain no satisfaction,
while to the defendant it might prove
the greatest injury in his rank and posi­
tion as an officer, and especially as he
is an officer who is poor and dependent
upon his pay. Do you still insist upon
your complaintP"" '
"" I still insist upon it.""
The course the aflair was taking
seemed to have become painful to the
lady' husband. lie spoke with his
wife urgently, Jjut, as could be seen by
the way she held up her head and the
energy with, which she shook it, quite
uselessly i. The Judge was just going
on to further consideration of the case,
when a loud voice was heard from the
audience : '
"" I will place the two hundred rubles
at the service of the defendant.""
There followed 'a- silence, during
which a gentleman forced his way
through the crowd and placed himself
by the young officer's side.
"" Sir, I ami the I'rincc V , and
beg you will' oblige me ""by accepting
the loan of the two hundred rubles in
question."" . . ... ' .' ,
"" Prince, I ani not worthy of your
kindness, for I don't know if I shall
y
ever be ablo to pay the loan,',' answered
the young man, in a voice tremulous
with emotion.
"" Take the money, at all events. I
can Wait until you' are able to return it.""
Thereupon the Prince held out two notes
of a hundred .rabies each, and coming
close up to him, whispered a few words
very softly. There was a sudden light­
ing up of the officer's face. He imme­
diately took the two notes, and, turning
toward the lady, handed them to her
with a polite bow.
"" I hope, madame, you are satisfied.""
With a malicious smile she reached
out her hand for the money.
44 Yes; now I am satisfied.""
Yitu a scornful glance over the crowd
of spectators, she prepared to leave the
Court-room on her husband's arm.
44 Stop, madame,"" said the officer,
who had su'ddenly become like another
man, with n firm and confident manner.
44 What do you want?""
The look that the young woman cast'
upon him was as insulting as possible.
44 1 wiyit my drcs,"" he ,an9wered,

ANECDOTE OF DR. YOUNG THE

and 'his friend ; hut finding persuasion
to have no effect upon him, one took him
by the right arm :ind the other by the
left, and led him to the garden gate. So,
when finding resistance in vain, he bow­

The eminent astronomer wag enthusiastically received on his appearance upon the stage, and was listened to with wrapt attention throughout, as he unfolded the wonderful tale of the universe. As on i n. - j. ? ^ i n It t . ? me nrst nigni oi tno lecture, Mr. Proctor appropriately concluded his peroration with a recital of Jean Paul Richter's 'Dream,' which we give as follows ' ' God called up from dreams a man into tho vestibule of heaven, saying, ' Come thou hither, and see the glory of my house.' And to the servants that stood around His throne He said, ' Take him, and undress him from his robes of flesh : cleanse his vision, and put a now breath .into his nostrils; arm him with sail-board wings for flight. Only touch not with any change his human heart— the heart that weeps and trembles.' It was done; and, with a mighty angel for his guide, the man stood ready for his infinite voyage, and from the terraces of heaven, without sound or farewell, at onco they wheeled away into endless spaco. Sometimes with the solemn flight of angel wing they fled through Zaarrahs of darkness, through wildernesses of death that divided th«s worlds of life : soirioviro.es. they swept o Vol' frontier*} that were quickening under prophetic motions towards life not yet exalted. Then, from a distance that is counted only in heaven, light dawned for a time through a sleepy film : by unutterable pace the light swept to thorn, they by unutterable pace to the light : in a moment the rushing of planets was upon them : in a moment the blazing of suns was around them. Then came eternities of twilight, that revealed, but were not revealed. To the right hand and to the left towerod mighty constellations, that by selfrepetitions and by answers from afar, that by counter-positions, that by mysterious- com-binations, built up triumphal gates, whoso architraves, whoso archways — horizontal, upiight rested, rose — at altitudes, by spans —that seemed ghostly from infinitude. Without measure were the architraves, past number were the archways, beyond memory the gates. _ Within wore stairs that scaled the eternities above, that descended to tho eternities below: above was below, below was above, to the man stripped of gravitating body: depth was swallowed up in height insurmountable, height was swallowed up m depth unfathomable. Suddenly as thoy rode from infinite to infinite, suddenly as thus they tilted over abysmal worlds, a mighty cry arose — that systems more mysterious, worlds more billowy— other heights and otber depths — were dawning were noaring, were at hand. Then the man sighed, stopped, shuddered, and wept. His overladen heart uttered itself in tears; 'and he said, - Angel, I will go no farther. Por ? t a°hes under this infinitv Insufferable is the glory of God's house. Let me lie, down m the grave, that I may find rest from the persecutions of the Infinite ; tor end, I see, there is none.' And from all the listening stars that shone around issued one choral chant— 'Even so it is: angel, thou knowest that it is : end there is none, that ever yet wo hoard of.* 'End is there none r the angel solemnly demanded. ' And is this the sorrow that kills ?' But no voico answeerd, that he might .answer himsolf. ihen the angel threw up his glorious hands to tne heaven of heavens, saying, 'End is ' there none to the universe of God?

great trial for clerks is the incon­

temptible when they come into a store
to buy anything. There are thousands
cf men and women who go from store
to store to price things, without any
Idea of purchase. They are not satisfied
until every roll of goods is brought
down and they have pointed out all the
real or imaginary defects. They try
on all kinds of kid gloves and stretch
them out of shape, and they put on all
tyles of cloak and walk to the mirror to
ee how they look, and then they sail

out of the store, saying, ""T will not
take it today,"" which means, ""I don't
want it at all,"" leaving the clerk amid
a wreck of ribbons and laces and cloths
to smooth out a thousand dollars'
worth of goods not a cent of which
did that man or woman buy or expect
to buy. Now, I call that a dishonesty
on the part of the customer. If a boy
runs into a store and takes a roll of
cloth off the counter and sneaks out into
the street, you all join in the cry pell­
mell, ""Stop thief!"" When I see you go
into a store, not expecting to buy any­
thing, but to price things, stealing the
time of the clerk and stealing the time
of his employer, I say, too, ""Stop thief!""
- If I were asked which class of per

sons most need the grace of God amid
their annoyances, I would say, ""Dry
goods clerks. "" All the indignation of
customers about the high prices comes
i I T71 1 A 1.
on the cierir. hot instance: a great,
war comes. The manufactories are
closed. The people go off to battle. The
price of goods runs up. A customer
comes into a store. Goods have gone up.
""How much is that worth?"" ""A dol­
lar."" ""A dollar! Outrageous! A dol­
lar!"" Why, who is to blame for the fact
that it has got to be a dollar? Does the
indignation go out to the manufacturers
on the banks of the Merrimac because
they have closed up? No. Does the in­
dignation go out toward the employer,
who is out at his country seat? No. It
comes on the clerk. He got up the war.
He levied the taxes. He puts up the
rents. Of course, the clerk.
Then a great trial comes to clerks in
the fact that they see the parsimonious
side of human nature. You. talk about
lies behind the counter there are just
as many lies before the counter. Au­
gustine speaks of a man who adver­
tised that he would, on a' certain occa­
sion, tell the people what was in their
hearts. A crowd assembled, and he
stepped to the front and said: ""I will
tell you what is in your hearts. To buy
cheap and sell dear. "" Oh, lay not aside
your urbanity when you go into a store!
Treat the clerks like gentlemen and la­
dies, proving yourself to be a gentle­
man or a lady. Remember that if the
prices arahigh and your purse is lean
that i3 no fault of the clerks. And if
you have a son or a daughter amid those
perplexities of commercial life, and
such a one comes home all worn out,
be lenient, and know that the martyr
at the stake no more certainly needs
the grace of God than our young peo­
ple amid the seven times heated exas­
perations of a clerk's life.
Inconsiderate Employers.
Then there are all the trials which
come to clerks from the treatment of
inconsiderate employers. There are pro­
fessed Christian men who have no more
regard for their clerks than they have
for the scales on which the sugars are
weighed. A clerk is no more than so
much store furniture. No consideration
for their rights or interests. Not one
word of encouragement from sunrise to
sunset, nor from January to December.
But when anything goes wrong a
streak of dust on the counter or a box
with the cover off thunder showers of
scolding. Men imperious, capricious,
cranky toward their clerks their whole
manner as much as to say, ""All the in­
terest I have in you is to see what I can
get out of you."" Then there are all the
trials of incompetent wages, not in
such times as these, when if a man gets
half a salary for his services he ought
to be thankful, but I mean in prosper­
ous times. Some of you remember when
the war broke out and all merchandise
went up, and merchants were made
millionaires in six months by the sim­
ple rise in the value of goods. Did the
clerks get advantage of that rise? Some­
times, not always. I saw estates gath­
ered in those times over which the
curse of God has hung ever since. The
cry cf unpaid men and women in those
stores reached the Lord of Sabaoth, and
the indignation of God has been around
those establishments ever since, flash­
ing in the chandeliers, glowing from
the crimson upholstery, rumbling in
the long roll of the tenpin alley. Such
men may build up palaces of merchan­
dise heaven high, but after awhile a
disaster will come along and will put
one hand on this pillar and another
hand on that pillar and throw itself for­
ward until down will come the whole
structure, crushing the worshipers as
grapes are mashed in the winepress.
Then there are boys ruined by lack
of compensation. In how many prosper­
ous stores it has been for the last 20
years that boys were given just enough
money to teach them how to- steal!
Some were seized upon by the police.
The vast majority of instances were not
known. The head of the firm asked,
""Where is George now?"" ""Oh, he isn't
here any more. ' ' A lad might better
starve to death on a blasted heath than
take one farthing from his employer.
Woe be to that employer who unneces­
sarily puts a temptation in a boy's way.
There have been great establishments in
these cities, building marble palaces,
their owners dying worth millions and
millions and millions, who made a vast­
amount of their estate out of the blood
and muscle and nerve of half paid
clerks. Such men as well, I will not
tnention any name. But I mean men
who have gathered up vast estates at
the expense of the people who were
ground under their heel. ""Oh,"" say
such merchants, ""if you don't like it
here, then go and get a better place!""
As much as to say: ""I've got you in
my grip, and I mean to hold you. You
cau't get any other place.""
' True Sympathy.
Oh, what a contrast between those
men and Christian merchants who to­
day are sympathetic with their clerks
when they pay the salary, acting in this
way: ""This salary that I give you is
not all my interest in you. You are an
immortal man; youware an immortal
woman. I am interested in your pre­
sent and your everlasting welfare. I
want you to understand that if I am a
little higher up in this store I ain be­
side you in Christian sympathy."" Go
back 40 or 50 years to Arthur Tappen's
store in New York, a man whose worst
enemies never questioned his honesty.

I Every morning be brought all the

clerks and the accountants and the
weighers into a room for devotion.
They sang, they prayed, they exhorted.
On Monday morning the clerks wero
asked where they bad attended church
on the previous day and what the ser­
mons were anout. It must have sound­
ed strangely, that voice of praise along
the streets where the devotees of Mr.ni­
mon were counting their golden beads.
You say, Arthur Tappen failed. Yes,
he was unfortunate, like a great many
good men, but I understand he met all
his obligations before he left this world;
and I know that he died in the peace of
the gospel and that he is before the
throne of G?d today forever blessed.
If that be failing, I wish you might all
fail.

FOR PRACTICAL. MEN'.
When the Ballot Box I Surrounded by
Corruption Ii the Time for the Chris­
tian to Work Hardest Daniel' Expe­
rience.Waco, Tes.. Aug. 31. Dr. Taliuage
today delivered the following discourse
on the text. ""Then the king command­
ed, and they brought Daniel and cast
hiiu into the den of Hons."" Daniel
vi. 16. '
Darius was king of Babylon, and the
young man Daniel was so much a f;v
vorite with him that he made him
prime minister, or secretary of state.
But uo man could gain such a high po­
sition without exciting the envy and
jealousy of the people. There were
demagogues in Babylon who were so
appreciative of their own abilities that
they were affronted at the elevation of
this young man. Old Babylon was
afraid of young Babylon. The taller
the cedar the more apt it is to be riven
of the lightning.
These demagogues asked the king to
make a decree that anybody that made
a petition to any one except the king
within thirty days should be put to
death. King Darius, not suspecting
any foul play, makes that decree. The
demagogues have accomplished all they
want, because they know that no one
can keep Daniel from sending petitions
before God for thirty days.
So far from being afraid, Daniel goes
on with his supplications three times a
day. and is found on his housetop mak­
ing prayer. lie is caught ia the act.
He is condemned to be devoured by
the lions. Rough executioners of the
law seize him and hasten him to
the cavern. I hear the growl of the
wild beasts, and I see them pawing the
dust, and as they put their mouths to
the ground the solid earth quakes with
their bellowing. I see their eyes roll,
and I almost hear the fiery eyeballs
snap in the darkness. These monsters
approach Daniel. They have an ap­
petite keen with hunger. With one
stroke of their paw or one snatch of
their teeth they may leave him dead at
the bottom of the cavern. But what
a strange welcome Daniel receives
from these hungry monsters. They
fawn around him, they lick his hand,
they bury his feet in their long manes.
That night he has calm sleep, with his
head pillowed on the warm necks of
the tamed Lions.
SAVED BT GOD.
But not so well does Darius the king
sleep. He loves Daniel, and hates this
stratagem by which he has been con­
demned. All night long the king walks
the floor. He cannot sleep. At the
least sound he starts and his flesh
creeps with horror. He is impatient
for the dawning of the morning. At
the first streak of the daylight Darius
hastens forth to see the fate of Daniel.
The heavy palace doors open and clang
shut long before the people of the city
waken. Darius goes to the den of li­
ons; he. looks in. All is silent. His
heart stops. He feels that the very
worst has happened; but gathering all
his strength he shouts through the rifts
of the rock, ""O Daniel! is the God
whom thou servest continually able to
deliver theer There comes rolling np
from the deep darkness a voice which
says: ""O king! live forever. My God
has sent his angel to shut the lions'
mouths that they have not hurt me.""
Tlien uaniei is Drougni out irotn tne
den. The demagogues are hurled into
it. and no sooner have they struck the
bottom of the den than their flesh was
rent, and their bones cracked, and their
blood spurted through the rifts of the
rock, and as the lions make the rocks
tremble with their roar they announce
to all ages that while God will defcn-.l
his people the way of the ungodly shall
perish.
THE CKIMK OF SUCCESS.
Learn first from this subject that the
greatest crime that you can commit in
the eyes of many is the crime of suc­
cess. What had Daniel done that he
should be flung to the lions? He got
to be prime minister. They could not
forgive him for that; and behold in
that a touch of unsanctified human
nature as seen in all ages of the world.
So long as you are pinched in poverty,
so long as you are running the gantlet
between landlord and tax gatherer, so
long as you find it hard work to edu­
cate your children, there are people
who will say: ""Poor man, I am sorry
for him. He ought to succeed, poor
man P
But after awhile the tide turns in
your favor. That was a profitable in­
vestment you made. You bought at
just the right tune. Fortune becomes
good humored and smiles upon you.
How you are being in some department
successful, your success chills some one.
Those men who used to sympathize
with you stand along the street, and
they scowl at you from under the rim
of their hats. You have more money
or more influence than they have, and
you ought to be scowled at from under
the rim of their hats. You catch a
: word or two as you passed by them.
""Stuck up,"" says one. ""Got it dishon­
estly,"" says another. ""Will burst 8000,""
says a third. Every stone in your new
house ia laid on their hearts. Your
horses' hoofs went over their nerves.
Every item of your .success has been
to them. an item of discomfiture and
despair. Just as soon as in any respect
you rise above your fellows, if you are
more virtuous, if you are more wise, if
yon are more influential, you cast a
shadow on the prospect of others. The
road to honor and success is within
ruach of the enemy's guns. Jealousy
says, ""Stay down, or I'll knock you
down."" ""I do not like you,"" said the
snowflake to the snowbird. ""Why
don't you like me?"" said the snowbird.
""Oh!"" said the snowflake, ""you are
going np and I am coining down.""
Young merchants, young lawyers,
young doctors, young mechanics,
young artists, young farmers, at cer­
tain times there were those to sym­
pathize with you. but now that
you are becoming master of your
particular occupation or profession,
how is it now, young lawyers, young
doctors, young artists, young farmers,
how is it now ? The greatest crime that
you can commit is the crime of success.
DECISION OP CHARACTER.
Again, my subject impresses me with
the value of decision of character in
any department. Daniel knew that if
life continued his adherence to the re­
ligion of the Lord he would be hurled
to the lions, but having set his compass
well he sailed right on.
For the lack of that element of de­
cision of character so eminent in Dan­
iel many men are ruined for this world,
and ruined for the world to come. A
great many at forty years of age are not
settled in any respect, because they
have not been able to make up their
mind. Perhaps they will go west.
Perhaps they will go east. Perhaps
they will not. Perhaps they will go
north. Perliaps they may go south.
Perhaps they will not. Perhaps they
may make that investment in real es­
tate or in railroads. Perhaps they will
not. They are like a steamer that
should go out of New York harbor,

starting tor Glasgow, and the next day
should change for Havre do Grace, and
the next for Charleston, and the next
for Boston, and the next for Liverpool
these men on the sea of life, everlast­
ingly tacking ship and making no head­
way. Or they are like a man who
starts to build a house in the Corinth­
ian style and changes it to Doric, and
then completes it in the Ionic, and is
cursed by all stylos of architecture.
START RIGHT AXD KEEP ON.

Young man, start right and keep on.ly
Have decision 01 cnaracter. Charac­
ter is like the goldfinch of Tonquin ; it
is magnificent while standing firm, but
loses all its beauty in flight. How much
decision of character in order that these
young men may be Christians ! Their
old associates make sarcastic flings at
them. They go on excursions and they
do not invite them. They prophesy
that he will give out. They wonder if
he is not getting wings. As he passes
they grimace and wink and chuckle,
and say, ""There goes a saint.""
Oh, young man, have decision of char­
acter. You can afford in this matter
of religion to be laughed at. What do
you care for the scoffs of these men
who are affronted because you will not
go to ruin with them? When the grave
cracks open under their feet, and grim
messengers push them into it, and eter­
nity comes down hard upon their
spirit, and conscience stings, and hope­
less ruin Lifts them up to hurl them
down, will they laugh then?
1 learn also from my subject that
men may take religion into their
worldly business. Daniel had enough
work to do to occupy six men. All the
affairs of state were in his hands
questions of finance, questions of war,
of peace, all international questions
were for his settlement or adjustment.
He must have had a correspondence
vast beyond all computation. There
was not a man in all the earth who
had-more to do than Daniel, the secre­
tary of state, and yet we find him three
times a day bowing before God in
prayer. There are men in our day
who have not a hundredth part of
Daniel's engagements who say they
are too busy to be religious. They
have an idea somehow that religion
will spoil their worldly occupation,
that it will trip the accountant's pen,
or dull the carpenter's saw, or confuse
the lawyer's brief, or disarrange the
merchant's store shelf.
IMPERTINENT RELIGION.
They tliink religion is impertinent.
They would 'like to have it very well
seated beside them in church on the
Sabbath, to find the place in the psalm
book, or to nudge them awake when
they get sleepy under the didactic dis­
course; or they would like to leave it in
the pew on Sabbath evening, as they
go out closing the door, saying, ""Good
night, religion ; I'll be back next Sun­
day I"" But to have religion go right
along by them all through life, to have
religion looking over their shoulder
when they are making a bargain, to
have religion take up a bag of dishonest
gold and shake it and say, ""Ha! ha!
where did you get that?"" they think
that is an impertinent religion. They
would like to have a religion to help
them when they are sick, and when the
shadow of death comes over them they
would like to have religion as a sort of
night key with which to open the door
of heaven ; but religion under other cir­
cumstances they take to be an imperti­
nence. Now. my friends, religion never
robbed a man of a dollar. Other things
being equal, a mason will build a bet­
ter wall, a cabinet maker will make a
better chair, a plumber will make a
better pipe, a lawyer will make a better
plea, a merchant will sell a better bill
of. goods.
I say other things being equal. Ol
course when religion gives a man a new
heart it does not propose to give liiiu a
new head, or to intellectualize him, or
to change a man's condition when liis
ordinary state is an overthrow of the
philosophical theory that a total vacu­
um is impossible; but the more letters
you have to write, the more burdens
you have to carry, the more miles you
have to travel, the more burdens you
have to lift, the more engagements you
have to maet, the more disputes you
have to settle, the more opportunity
you have of being a Christian.
THE BUSIEST MEN THE BEST MEN.
If you hp ve a thousand irons in the
fire, you have a thousand more oppor­
tunities of serving God than if you
had only one iron in the fire. Who so
busy as Christ? And yet who a mill­
ionth part as holy? The busiest men
the best men. All the persons convert­
ed in Scripture busy at the time of
their being converted. Matthew at­
tending to his custom house duties ; the
Prodigal Son feeding swine; Lydia
selling purple; Simon Peter hauling in
the net from the sea; Saul spurring his
horse toward Damascus, going down on
his law business. Busy I busy ! Daniel
with all the affairs of state weighing
down upon his soul, and yet three times
a day worshiping the God of heaven.
Again, I learn from this subject that
a man may take religion into his
politics. Daniel had all the affairs of
state on hand, yet a Christian. He
could not have kept his elevated posi­
tion unless he had been a thorough
politician, and yet all the thrusts of of­
ficials and all the danger of disgrace
did not make him yield one iota of his
high toned religious principle. He
stood before that age, he stands before
all ages, a specimen of a Christian
politician.
So there have been in our day and
in the days of our fathers men as emi­
nent in the service of God as they have
been eminent in the service of the
state. Such was Benjamin F. Butler,
attorney general of New York in the
time of your fathers. Such was John
McLean, of Ohio. Such was George
Briggs, of Massachusetts. Such was
Theodore Frelinghuysen, of New Jer­
sey. Men faithful to the state, at the
same time faithful to God.
OUR HOPE 13 IN THE YOUNG MEN.
It is absurd to expect that men who
have been immersed in political wick­
edness for thirty or forty years shall
come to reformation ; and our hope is
in the young' men who are coming up,
that they have patriotic principle and
Christian principle side by side when
they come to the ballot box and cast
their first vote, and that they swear al­
legiance to the government of heaven
as well as to tiie government of the
United States. ' We would have Bunker
Hill mean less to them than Calvary,
and Lexington mean less to them than
Bethlehem.
But because there are bad men
around the ballot box is no reason
why Christian men should retreat from
the arena. The last time you ought to
give up your child or forsake your
child is when it is surrounded by a
company of Choctaws; and the last
time to surrender the ballot box is
when it is surrounded by impurity and
dishonesty and all sorts of wickedness.
Daniel stood on a most unpopular
platform. He stood firmly, though the
demagogues of the day hissed at him
and tried to overthrow him. We must
carry our religion into our iolitics. But
there are a great many men who are in
favor of taking religion into national
politics who do not see the importance
of taking it into city politics, as though
a man were intelligent about the wel­
fare of his neighborhood and had no
concern about his own home.
Religion would drive out all base
personalities from politics. You have
a right to discuss men's politics and de­
nounce their political sentiments, or re

ceive them, as you will ; but you have
no right to assail their private charac­
ter, as is done every autumn. That is
not carrying religion into politics. Now
you can always tell without asking, in
any contest, what candidate I will vote
for. It is always for the man who is
most badgered, and most abused, and
most spit upon, nd most howled at.
You have a right to contest a man's po­
litical sentiments; you have no right
for base political purposes to assail liis
private moral character.
LIONS SURROUND YOU.
My subject also impresses me with
the fact that lions cannot hurt a good
man. No man ever got into worse
company than Daniel got into when he
was thrown into the den. What a rare
morsel that fair young man would have
been for the hungry monsters! If they
had plunged at him he could not have
climbed into a niche beyond the reach
of their paw or the snatch of their
tooth. They carao pleased all about
him, as a hunter's hounds at the well
known whistle come bounding to his
feet.
You need not go to Numidia to get
among lions. You all have had them
after you the lion of financial distress,
the lion of sickness, the lion of perse­
cution. You saw that lion of financial
panic putting his mouth down to the
earth, and he roared until all the banks
and all the insurance companies quaked.
With his nostril he scattered the ashes
on the domestic hearth. You have had
trial after trial, misfortune after misfort­
une, lion after lion ; and yet they have
never hurt you if you put your'trust
in God, and they never will hurt you.
They did not hurt Daniel, and they
cannot hurt you.
The Persians used to think that
spring rain falling into sea shells would
turn into pearls; and I have to tell you
that the tears of sorrow turn into
precious gems when they drop into
God's bottle. You need be afraid of
nothing putting your trust in God.
Even death, that monster lion whose
den is the world's sepulcher, and who
puts hti paw down amid thousands of
millions of the dead, cannot affright
you.
When in olden times a man was to
get the honors of knighthood he was
compelled to go fully armed the night
before among the tombs of the dead
carrying a sort of sjear, and then when
the day broke ho would come forth,
and amid the sound of cornet and great
parade he would get the honors of
knighthood. And so it will be with
the Christian in the night before
heaven, as fully armed with spear and
helmet of salvation he will wait and
watch through the darkness until the
morning dawns, and then he will take
the honors of heaven amid that great
throng with snowy robes streaming
over seas of sapphire.

                 peared, had a tew minutes betore lad a watch taker from his pocket, and he knew the offender must be ir the room with them.
                 ""Come, Mr. Alinanack.maker! you lknow the s&amp;gnE of' the times, the hidden things of the season; tell who is the thief!""
                 ""E'asten all the doors of the room, and let no one leave it; and here, landlord, go and bring your wife's great brass kettle""-
                 ""Wh-ew! want to know! my stars! my wife's- whew-ew!"" quoth Boniface.
                 ""Why, you wouldn't be more struck up, if I told you to go to pot!""
                 Bunilace did as commanded. The great brass ket. tle was placed in the middlc of the floor, its bottom up -as black, sooty and snokey as a chimney back.- The landlord got into his bar, and looked on with eyes as big as saucers.
                 ""Yiu don't want any hot water nor nothin, to take off the bristles of no critter, do you, squire 7"" said the landlord, the preparations looking a little too much like hog killing-""the old woman's gone to bed, and the well's dry !""
                 ""Now go into your barn, and bring the biggest cock. erell you've got.""
                 ""Whew !-you won't bile him, will you 7-he's a tough one. I can swear, squirc, he didn't steal the watch. The old rooster knows when it's time to crow without looking at a watch !""
                 ""Go along, or I won't detect the thief.""
                 Boniface went to the barn, and soon returned with a tremendous great rooster, crackling all the way like mad.
                 'Now put him under the kettle, and blow the light out.""
                 The old rooster was thrown under the inverted ket. tile, and the lamp blown out.
                 ,'Now, gentlemen, 1 don't spose the thief is in the company, but it he is, the old rooster will crow when the oflender touches the bottom of the kettle with his Iands! Walk round in a circle, and the cock will make known the watch stealer. The innocent need not be afraid you know !""
                 The company then, to humour him, and carry out the joke, walked round the kettle in the dark for three or tour minutes.
                 All done, gentlemen?""
                 ""All done !"" was the cry-""where's your crowing: we heard no cockadoodle doo !""
                 Bring us alight.""
                 A light was brought, as ordered.
                 Now hold up your hands, good folks ?""
                 One held up his hand after anotlher. They were of course black, from coming in contact with the soot of the kettle.
                 All up?""
                 ""All up !"" was the response. ""All black?""
                 ""A-11-don't know; here's one fellow who hasn't held uphis hand!""

                 ""You'll find your watch about him-search !""

BV FRED. HUNTER.
A great many years since, when bright
eyed and fair-haired lasses were not so
plenty in New England as they are now,
there dwelt in the town ol P , a pretty
village, distant then, some five-ami -twen
ty miles from 'Market-town."" a peculiar­
ly comely and graceful maiden who had
! a peculiarly ugly and cross-grained but
wealthy old father.
M in nie was Dinforth'a only child; and
report said truly that she would be his
sole legatee. The old min was a sturdy
farmer, and was estimated to be worth
full ten thousand dollars; at that period,
a very handsome fortune, to be sure.
The sparkling eyes and winning man­
ners of Minnie Danforth had stirred up
the finer feelings of the whole mile por­
tion of the village, and her suitors were,
numerous, but her father was particular,
and none succeded in making headway
with him or her.
In the mean time, Minnie had a true
and loyal lover in secret! Who would
supposed for one moment that auch a
fellow would dare to look on beauty and
comparative refinement? His name was
Walker, or, as he was generally called,
o""' Joe Walker; and he was simply a
farmer, employed byold -DTrrforth, who
had entrusted Joe with the
management
of his place for two or three years.
But a very excellent farmer, anda right
good manager, was this plain, unassuming,
but good looking Joe Walker. He ws

IN 1851 thero lived in a small town in
tho Stato of New York tho deacon
of a certain Christian church, who was
noted for his liberal qualities, who was in
the habit of giving largo wine suppers
among his brotherhood of tho church,
and as a general thing, the guests would
return homo rather moro than slightly
inebriated; or rather moro intoxicated
than they would havo been if they had
staid at home and enjoyed tho pleasure of
their own families, and saved themselves
tho trouble of carrying tho big head upon
their own shoulders on tho following day,
as was tho case. Thosccno which I wish

Upon a Christmas day of '51 it was

After tho marriago ceremony hud been
performed, tho bottles of wino wero

It was tho brido ; whilo tho words were
spoken from ono of tho crowd, "" Plcdgo

the young and thoughtless Harvy Wood ;
"" Pledge with wine,"" ran through the
crowd.
The beautiful brido grew pale; tho de­

hands together, and tho leaves of her bri­
dal wreath trembled on her pure brow;
her breath came quicker, and her heart
beat wilder.
""Yes, Marion, lay asido your scruples
for this once,"" said tho deacon in a low
tone, going toward his daughter; ""tho
company expect it ; do not so infringe
upou tho rules of etiquette: in your own
homo aet as you please, but in mine, for
thisonco please me.""
Every eyo was turned toward tho
brido, for Marion's principles wero well
known. Henry had been a convivi.ilist,
but of Into his friends had noticed tho

"" Oh, how terrible!""
""What is it?"" cried one aud all,
thronging together, for sho had carried
tho glass to her arm's length, and was
fixedly regarding it as though it was somo
hideous object.
"" What?"" she answered while unin

aud I will tell you., I seo,"" sho added,
slowly raising ouo of her fingers at the
sparkling liquid, "" a sight thut beggars all

water's edge. There is a thick, warm
mist, that the sun seeks vainly to pierce.
Trees, lofty and beautiful, wave to tho
motion of the breeze. But there a group
of Indiuns gather, and flit to and fro with
something like sorrow upon their dark
brows, aud in their midst lies a manly
form but his dark cheek, how deathly

"439","530079","TUB DAUBS IN TUB CLOUDS.
Just teu years ago, there suddenly burst
upon the Western world, a magnificent
stranger from foreign parts, ""with all his
traveling glories on."" It was tho great
comet of 1858, on the grand tour of the
universe.
It seemed strange ""that petty human lifo
could go on as usual, with its eating and
drinking, toiling, trafficking and pleasuring,
while that ""Haming minister,"" on bis bul?
lion-leagued circuit, was preaching the
wonders of infinite immensity aud power,
aud the nothingness of earth. But science
bas robbed celestial apparitions of their old
portentous significance. Tho comet no
longer runs his kindling race, like Vicli­
, Alpine's henchman, with his fiery cross,
announcing war and disaster, '
Herald of battle, fate and fear,
Ile is on bis own business; not ours.
Under tho tail of this particular cornet
doubtless many a tale of love was told-in
the light of his swift splendors many a
tender look exchanged. Tho astronomer
coolly swept tho starry field with bis glass,
unawed by tho irregular night-guard patrol?
ing tho Heavens, and tho robber and mur?
derer disdained tlu> awful witness. He left
as he found ns-joined to our mortal idols­
wiso in our conceit, weak and worldly aud
wicked, but no castaways of tho universo
after all.
We remember that comet summer, not so
much for its great astronomical event, as for
two singular incidents that moro nearly
touched our human sympathies, which will
.grovel in poor earthly affairs even within
sight of the most august celestial phenomena.
Ono pleasant Saturday afternoon during
tho comet's appearance, an aeronaut, after a
prosperous voyage, descended upon a farm
in tho neighborhood of a large market town,
in one of the Western States. He was soou
surrounded by a curious group of tho far?
mer's family and laborers, all asking eager
questions about tho voyage and the manage?
ment of the balloon. That, secured by an
anchor and a rope in thc band of the aero?
naut, its car but a foot or two ubovo tho
ground, was swaying la/.ily backward and
forward in the evening air. It was a good
deal ont of wind, and was a sleepy und inno?
cent monster in'the eyes of the farmer, who,
with the owner's permission, led it up to his
house, where, us ho said, ho could ""hitch
it"" to his fence. But before ho thus secured
it, Iiis three children, aged respectively ten,
eight and three, begged bim to lift them
""into that big basket,"" that they might sit
on ""tboso pretty red cushions.""?tWhilo tho]
attention of tho tero mint was diverted by
moro curious questioners from a neighbor?
ing farm, this rush father lifted bis durlings
one by ono into tho cur. Chubby little
Johnny prcvpd thc ""ounce Loo mach"" for
tho aerial camel, and brought bim to tho
ground; and thou, unluckily, not the baby,
but tho eldest hopo of tho family, was lifted
out. The relief was too great for the mon?
ster. Tho volatile creature's spirits roso at
once, ho jerked his baiter ont of thu farmer's
hand, and with a wild bound, mounted into
tho air. Vain wus tho sorouuut's anchor.
It caught for a moment in a fence, but it
tore away, and was off, dangling uselessly
utter the runaway balloon, which HO swiftly
and steadily rose, that in a few minutes
those two little whito faces peering over tho
edgo of the car grew indistinct, and tboso
piteous cries of ""papa!"" ""mamma!"" grow
faint and fainter in the air.
When distance and ?-..light mists had
swallowed up voices ar.?J faces, and nothing
could be seen but tho durk cruel shspe,
sailing triumphantly away, with its precious
booty, like au aerial privateer, tho poor

father sank down helpless and speechless; !
feat the mother, frantic with grief, still
stretched her yearning arms toward the
inexorable heavens, and ca1 lcd wildly up
into the unanswering void.
The noronaut strove to console the
wretched parents with assurances that the
balloon woold descend within thirty miles of
town, and that all might be well with the
ohildren, provided it did not come
down in water, or in deep woods. In
the event of its descending in a favorable
spot, there was but one danger to be appre?
hended; he thought that the elder child
might step out, leaving the younger in the
balloon. Then, it might again rise, and
continuo its voyage.
..Ab. v??V' replied the mother, ""Jennio
would never stir from the car, without
Johnnie in her arms!""
Tho balloon passed directly over the town,
and the children, seeing many people in tho
streets, stretched out their bundi- and cried
loudly for help. But the villagers, though
they saw tho bright little heads, heard no
call.
Amazed at tho strange apparition, they
might almost have thought tho translated
little creatures small angel navigators on
some voyage of discovery, somo little che?
rubic venture of their own, as, heading
toward the rosy cloud-lands aud purplo
islands of sun-sot splendor, they sailed deeper
and deeper into tho West and faded away.
Some company they had, poor little sky­
waifs! Something comforted them, and
allayed their wild terrors-something whis?
pered them that below tho night aud clouds
was home; that above was God; that where­
ever they might drift or clash, living or
dead, they would still be in His domain and
under His care-that though borne away
among tho stars, they could not bo lost, for
His lovo would follow them.
When the sunlight all went away, and thc
great comet came bluziug out, little rf chun ic
was apprehensive that tho comet mighl
como too near their airy craft, nnd sol
it on fire with a whisk of its dreadful
tail. But when Iiis sister assured him that
tho liory dragon was ""as much us tweutj
miles awuy,"" and that God wouldn't let bia
hurt thom, ho was tranquilized, but soot
afterward said, ""I wish bo would como t
little nearer, so I could warm myself-l'a
so cold.""
Then Jcunio took oil' her apron, ant
wrapped it about the child, saying tenderly
""Thia is all sister has to make you warm
darling, but she'll hug you close in bei
arms, and we will say our prayers, aud yoi
shall go to sleep.""
""Why, how can I say my prayers before'
huve my supper?"" asked little johnnie.
""Sister hasn't any supper for you, or fo
herself, but wo must pray all tho harder,
solemnly responded Jennie.
So tho two baby-wanderers, alone in th
wide heavens, unawed by darkness, immeu
sity and silence, by the presence of tho groa
comet and tho millions of unpitying stars
lifted their little clasped hands, nnd sot.be
out their sorrowful ""Our Father,"" and th?*
that quaint little supplementary prayer:
Now I lay mo down to a'.cop.
I pray tho Lord my aoul to keep,
If I ."".binilil dio before I wake,
I pray tho Lord my soul to take.
""There! God heard that, easy; for-wo ai
closo to Him, up here,"" said iunoceut littl
Johnuie.
Doubtless, Divine Love stooped to tl
little ones, and folded them in perfect peat
-for soon tho younger, sitting on the bo
tom of the car, with his head leaning again:
his sister's knee, slept as soundly as thou?
he were lying in his own little bod at homi
while the elder watched quietly through tl
long, long hours, and the car floated gent!
on in tho still night air, till it began to swi
and rock on tho fresh morning wind.
Who can divino that simple little child
thoughts, speculations and wild imagining
while watching through those hours? Si
may bavo feared coming in collision with
meteor-for many were abroad that nigh
scouts and heralds of tho great comet-o
perhaps, being cast away on somo deso?a

compelled sub­

arms against him
Sir John Coch­
rane was one of
the most form­
idable enemies to

his dangerous
nsurpations.and one ef the most prom­
inent actors in Arg-yle'a rebellion. For,
agea a destructire doom seemed to
hae hung1 over the house of Camp­
bell, uniting in . common rain all
k who joined their fortunes to the cause
of its chief. Sir John Cochrane was
no exception. He ' was surrounded
by the king's troops, and, after a long
and desperate resistance.he was taken
prisoner, and was tried and condemned
to die upon the scaffold. He had but
a few days to live, and his jailer
awaited only the arrival of the death­
warrant to lead him to execution.
His friends had visited him and ex­
changed the last farewells all but
one; his daughter Grizel, the pride of
his house, his dearest treasure, she
alone had not come to receive his last
blessing.
Night had fallen on the prison, and
the father sat with his head pressed
against the cold, damp walls of his
cell, longing for a last look of his
favorite child, when the door oxened,
and the keeper entered, followed by a
young and beautiful girl. Her person
was tall and commanding, her eyes
dark, bright, and tearless with a sor­
row too deep to be weDt away. The
unhappy prisoner raised his head.
'My child! my own Grizel!"" he ex­
claimed, as he Dressed her to his heart
""My father! my dear father!""
sobbed the miserable maiden.
""Your interview must be short, very

short,"" said the jailer as he closed the

door, and left them together.
""Heaven helD and comfort

thee, my precious child!"" said
61r John. ""I had feared that I

should die without bestowing my

blessing on the head of my daughter,

and that stung me more than death;
but thou art come, my love thou art
come! and the last blessing of thy
wretched father ""
""Nay, father, forbear!"" she ex­
claimed; ""not thy last blessing! not
thy last! My father shall not die!""
""Be calm,"" be calm, my child,"" he
said. ""Would to Leaven that I could
comfort thee, mv own! But there is
no hope; within three days thou and
all my little ones will be "" Father­
less, he would have said, but the
words died upon his lips
""Three days,"" she repeated, raising
her head from his breast, but eagerly
pressing his hand; ""three days! then
there is hope my father shall live.
Is not my grandfather the friend of
Father Petre, the confessor and mas­
ter of the king? From him he shall
beg the life of his son, and my father
shall not die.""




""DISMOBTtTl-miED THE STBANGEB.

t'Nay, nay, my Grizel,"" he returned,

'be not deoieved; there is no hope.
Already my doom is sealed. ' ; Already
"" the king has signed the order for my
- execution, and the - messenger of
death is now on his way.""
' ""Yet my father shall not shall not
,. die!"" she repeated emphatically, and
clasping her hands, ""Heaven speed a
daughter's purpose!'' , she exclaimed;
, and turning to her father, said calmly,
"".'. ""We part now, but we shall 1 meet
again.""
T ""What do you mean, my child?"" he
inquired eagerly, gazing anxiously
on her face.
""Ask not now, she replied, 'my
father, ask not now. Pray for me,
f and bless me, but not with thy last
-'""-.blessing. "",
He again pressed her"" to his heart,
and wept upon her neck. In a few
,: momenta the jailer entered, and the
door was closed between the father
c and daughter.
On the evening of the second day
after this interview, a wayfaring man
crossed the drawbridge at Berwick
: from the north, and, proceeding along
- Marygate, sat down to rest upon a
j bench, by the door of an inn on
the south aide of the street,
nearly fronting the spot where
i what was called the ""main guard""
. then stood. He did not enter the inn,
for it was, above his apparent con­
.' dition, bing that which Oliver Crom­
.wetf had made his headquarters a few
years before, and where, at a some-
I what earlier period, .James VI, of
' Scotland had taken up his residence,
when on hit way to England The
traveler wore a coarse jerkin, fastened
round the waist by a leathern girdle,
ad over it a short eloak of plain
material. He was evidently a young
man, but his beaver was drawn down
o as almost to conceal his features.
II In one hand he carried a small bnndle,
and in the others staff. Having called
i f a r'is of wine, ha took a crust of
"" Jad from hi bundle, and after rat-

lug a short time, rose to depart Night
was coming on, and a storm was
threatening. The heavens grew black;
the clouds rushed from the set; sud­
den gusts of wind moaned through
the streets, accompanied by heavy
drops of rain, and the face of the
Tweed was troubled.
""Heaven help thee if thou iotendest
to travel far in such a night as this.'""
said the sentinel at the English gate,

as the traveler passed him to cross the
bridge. ' , .
In a few minutes he was npon the
wide and desolate moor of .Tweed­
mouth; which for miles presented a
desert of furze, fern, and stunned
heath, with here and there a copse of
thick brushwood. He tlowlr toiled

over the steep hill, braving the storm,
which now raged with the wildest
fury. The rain fell in tot rents, and
the wind howled like a legion of fam­
ished wolves, hurling its doleful echoes

over the heath. Still the stranger

pushed onward, until two or three
miles from Berwick, when, as if nna-

ble to longer brave the storm, he

sought shelter amidst some bushes by

the wayside. Nearly an hour had
passed bio.ee he sought this imperfect
refuge, and the darkness of the night
and the storm had increased together,
when the sound of a horse's feet was
heard hurriedly plashing along the
road. The rider bent his head to the

blast Suddenly his horse was
grasped by the bridle; the rider raised
his head, and the stranger stood be

fore him holding a pistol tq his

breast ""Dismount!"" cried the
stranger sternly-

The horseman, benumbed and fear­
stricken, made an effort to reach his
arms; but instantly the hand of the
robber, quitting the bridle, grasped
the breast of the rider and dragged
him to the ground. He fell heavily
on his face, and for several minutes
was senseless. The stranger seized
the leather bag which contained the
mail for the north and flinging it
across his shoulder, rushed across the
heath.
Early on the following morning the
inhabitants of Berwick were seen
hurrying in groups to the spot where
the robbery had been committed, but
no trace of the robber could be ob­
tained.Three days had passed and Sir John

Cochrane still lived. The mul which

contained his death-warrant had been
robbed, and before another order for

his execution could be given, the in

tereession of his father, the earl of

Dundonald, with the king's con­
fessor, might be successful.
Grizel now became the almost
constant companion of her father.
Nearly a fortnight had passed
since the robbery of the mail, and
protracted hope in the bosom of the
prisoner became more bitter than his
first despair. But even that hope,
bitter as it was, perished. The in­
tercession of his father had been
unsuccessful; and a second King James
signed the death-warrant Within
little more than another day that
warrant would reach the prison.
""The will of Heaven be done!""
groaned the captive.
""Amen!"" responded Grizel with wild
vehemence, ""yet my father shall not
die."" . ,y,'-'-V .
Again the rider with the mail had
reached the moor of Tweedmouth,
and a second time he bore with him
the doom of Sir John Cochrane. He
spurred his horse to its utmost speed
he looked cautiously before, behind,
and around, and in his right hand he
carried a pistol ready to defend him­
self. The moon shed a ghostly light
across the heath. . He turned the
angle af a straggling corpse when his
horse reared at the report of a pistol,
the fire of which seemed to flash in its
very eyes. At the same moment
his own .; pistol went off, and,
his horse again rearing, he
was thrown from the saddle-;
In a moment the robber with his foot
upon th&amp; Jorwast rff the messenger, was
ji .1-1 1

oeuuiujr uvcr mux auu uranuisuing a
short dagger, saying:
""Give me thine arms, or die!"".
The heart of the king's servant
failed him, and, without venturing a
reply, he did as he was commanded
,; ""Now go thy way,"" said the robber
sternly, ""but leave me thy horse and
the mail, lest a worse thing come upon
thee."" -
The man arose, and returned to
Berwick, and the robber, mounting
the: horse, rode rapidly across the
hnfh. .rii'i; ; . :'. -'.'i
' Preparations were making for the
execution of Sir John Cochrane, and
the officers of the law waited only for
the arrival of the mail with the sec­
ond death-warrant, when the news
arrived that the mail had again been

robbed. 5 s For yet fourteen days the
prisoner's life would be prolonged.
Putting his arms about bis daughter,
he said, ""It is good. The hand of
Heaven is in this!''
""Said 1 not"" replied bis child, and
for the first time she wept, ""said I not
that my father should not die?""
The fourteen days were not past
when the prison-door flew open, and
the earl of Dundonald rushed to the
arms of his son. His intercession with
the confessor had been successful, and,
after twice signing the warrant for
the execution of Sir John, the king
had sealed his pardon.
He hurried with his father to hit
own house; his family were clinging
around him, shedding tears of joy.
Gtizel only was absent They were
marveling with gratitude at the mys­
terious providence that had twice in­
tercepted the mail, and saved his lite,
when a stranger craved an audience.
Sir John desired him to be admitted,
and the robber entered; he was dressed
In a coarse cloak, and coarser jerkin,
bvt his bearing seemed beyond his
condition. On entering, he slightly
touched his beaver, but did no4ra
move it
""When you have read these,"" said
he, taking two paoers from his bosom,
""cast them into the fire.""
, Sir John glanced them over-

started, and became pain. They wen
his death warrants. - ,
""My deliverer!"" he exclaimed; 'oa
hovr shall I thank the- how repay
the saviour of my life? ' My father
my children thank him for me!""
The old earl grasped the hand of
the stranger the children embraced
his knees. He pressed his hand to his
lace, and burst into tears.
""By what name,"" eagerly inqnired
Sir John, ""shall I thank 'my deliv

erer."" . ' -. - , - '
She stranger wept alond, and rais­
ing his beaver, the raven tresses of
Grizel Cochrane fell over the coarse
clonk. :-:.'.'r'
""Gracious heavens!"" exclaimed the
astonished and enraptured father,
""my own child mv own Grizel!"" v.
It is unnecessary to add more. The
reader can supply the rest, and we
may only add that Grizel Cochrane,
whose heroism we have briefly

sketched, was the grandmother of the
grandmother of the late Sir John
Stewart of Allendank in Berwickshire
and great-grandmother of Mr. Coutts,
the celebrated banker. Consequently
she was the greatgreat-great-grand-mother
of Baroness Burdett-Coutts.

The man who poses as 'a summer
beau par excellence is generally far
more silly than his feminine op­
posite. In many instances he ia off
on a vacation of but two weeks, and
has saved up all his odd pennies
toward the acquirement of a varied
wardrobe with which he intends to
dazzle the eyes of the girls with
whom he comes in contact He
changes his clothes three or four

times a day, and is as particular
about having every article up to the
top notch of fashion as a woman ia
regarding the fit of her gown.
As an excuse for his personal van­
ity it must be said that he is very
young, says the Washington Supper
Table. Sense comes with years, and
he has no desire later on to pose as a
summer man. Even though his con­
cern over his various suits of clothes
is his only weakness, when he ar­
rives at a hotel he will undoubtedly
acquire another one before he has
been long 'under the roof, for the

scarcity of men who are willing to
dance attendance upon the caprices
of the summer girl makes him popu

lar at once, even though he may not
have a grain of sense in his head or
more than his two weeks' salary in
his pocket
This consideration at once causes

him to think that he is a very faaci-.

nating creature, and he acts on this
principle until an influx of masou­
lines on Saturday night opens his
eyes to the fact he was all right if
there were no others around, but
when there are several to be com­
manded he is not so important a
personage as he imagined.
Sometimes it is pitiful to see the
way a summer man is snubbed when
others more worthy to be angled for
appear upon the scene, and yet from
season to season he bobs up serene­
ly, and is content to be the great ""I
am"" during the week and , take sec­
ond place over Sunday. As a parcel
carrier, a candy buyer and an excel­
lent target for flirtation practice the
summer man is all right, but as a
husband who can be. depended on in
sickness and in health, for, better or
for : worse, he is not . to be recom­
mended as yet. -

those who propose traveling, which we republish with

a few additional comments :

Take one-fourth mofe money than vour actual esti

mated expenses."" - , -

Unless you have an inconveniently large bank account

it is better, perhaps, on the whole, to take all you can
lay hands on. Nobody knows what chances for specu­
lating may turn up.

"" Acquaint yourself with the freoerapbv of the route

and region of travel.""

Exactly. He who knows where he is coins; and in

what manner, has fifty per cent, advantage over the
ignoramus. Consult rail road tables carefully, and aik

of travellers who have been over the road as to routes ?.
and hours of starting. Many a man through ismorance

goes the worst and dearest road.

"" llavemg a good supply of small change, and have no
bill or piece higher than ten dollars, that you may not

take counterfeit change.""
Say five and be particular in looking at what mo­
ney you get especially in New York.

"" bo arrange a3 to have but a single article of lug

gage to look after.""

Don t you wish that you may so arrange it, especially ,
if you are to travel with ladies ?
"" Dress substantially ; better be too hot for two or
three hours at noon, than to be too cool for the remainder
of the twenty-four.""
Sense itself. And dress for travel not for looks.
Nothing looks better in travelling than plain clothes,
and nothing so snobbish as full dress.
"" Arrange, under all circumstances, to be at the place
of starting fifteen or twenty minutes before the time,
thus allowing for unavoidable or unanticipated detention
on the way.""
Good again. Of stitches in tima which save nine,
there is none like being in time in the cars or steamboat.
Pickpockets always wait for the last rush for the elev­
enth hour ninnies, who crowd around the office to buy
tickets, and then rush to jump the ferry.
"" Do not commence a day's travel before breakfast,
even if that has to be eaten at dayilght. Dinner or
supper, or both, can be more healthfully dispensed with
than a good warm breakfast.""
A good rule, much followed in Europe, is never to go
out of the house without first taking at least a cup of
coffee. It is very injurious to health to exercise before

oreaiiiast without at least tni3 precaution. TaKe some­
thing, at all events, before going out.

"" if ut your purse and watch in your pocket, and all

under your pillow, and you will not be likely to leave

either.""

Say your pantaloons. We have known men in warm

weather to forget not only watch and purse, but also
their waistcoat, as easily as S. B. forgets his old friends.

uut pantaloons are much less likely to be forgotten.

The secure lastemng of your chamber door, is a

common bolt on the inside ; if it can be drawn partly
out, and put the wash basin under it ; thus, any attempt
to use a jimmy or put in another key, will push it out,

and cause a racket among the crockery, which will be
pretty certain to rouse the sleeper and rout the robber.""

An excellent device is a simple wooden wedge stuck
tightly between the door and the floor, with a chair or
trunk at a little distance. Whoever forces the door, will
have to rap the trunk so as to waken the sleeper. There
is an excellent little contrivance of a ring and screw made
for this purpose, which might be peddled about to ad­
vantage in hotels and steamboats. -
"" A sixpenny sandwhich eaten leisurely in the cars, is
better for you than a dollar dinner bolted at a 'station.' ""
This is better understood in Europe than in this coun­
try, where the Baron, or Madame la Comtesse general­
ly Las a handsome traveling case of cold cutlets, biscuit
and hock, or Chablis put up all light and palatable.
The dinner which stands as "" best enjoyed "". in our mem­
ory, was one to.which we were invited in a diligence,
by an old Austrian, Her Graft, who evidently under­
stood the sublime art of traveling and making friends,
without incurring heavy expenses. We sincerely trust
that whatever Louis Napoleon may do, he will draw it
mildly on that old gentleman when he catches up with
him !
"" Take with you a month's supply of patience, and al
ways think thirteen times before you reply once to any
supposed rudeness or insult, or inattention .""
Self-evident. But we admit that it must come hard
on a lady when obliged to stand up in car A. until the
conductor chances in, because some blackguards, with­
out ladies, have got the seats. There are certain verdant
wretches who think that a blustering tone is a sign of
intelligence. They arc soon used up, in the due course
of travel.
"" Do not suppose yourself specially and designedly
neglected, if waiters at hotels do not bring what you
call for in double quick time; nothing so distinctly
marks the well bred man as a quiet waitiog on such oc­
casions ; passion proves the puppy.""
Waiters often have much trouble themselves in filling
orders. Decent people are those who find least cause of
complaint wiih servants, and have the least cause of
complaint given them.
Do not allow yourself to converse in a tone loud enough
to be heard by persons at two or three seats from you ;
it is the mark of a boor if, in a man, and of want of re­
finement and lady-like delicacy, if in a woman. A gen­
tleman is not noisy, ladies are serene.
People who can be heard by those around, are most
invariably talking at those around and not to each Oth­
er. Young man if you intend marrying, be certain
whether your Amanda talks aloud before strangers. If
she does break it short off. She will grow up a sorrow.
"" Comply cheerfully and gracefully with the customs
of the conveyances in which you travel, and of the pla­
ces where you stop.""
This is sweetest of all. Never boast of "" our ways,""
and ostentatiously show off your locality. It is the very
cream of greenness. - ' ' ' -
"" Respect yourself, by exhibiting' the manners of a
gentlemen and lady, if you wish to be treated as such,
and then you will receive the respect of others.
"" Travel is a great leveller ; take the position which
others assign you from your conduct, rather than from
your pretentions."" "" ;
All true. Travel is a good school. The time will
come when travel as a branch of education will be dis­
cussed by all oar first educationists. Phila","literary"

Walk two days till yon come to a great fir-tree that stands all alone in the forest, and overtops all other trees. If you can hew it down, you will make your fortune."" Not waiting to have the advice repeated, the farmer shouldered his axe, and started on his journey. Sure enough, after tramping two days, ne came to the fir-tree, which he instantly prepared to cut down. Justas the tree swayed, and before it fell with a crash, there dropped out of its branches a nest containing two eggs. The eggs rolled to the ground and broke, and there darted out of one a young eagle, and out of the other rolled a gold ring. The eagle grew larger, as if by enchantment, and when it reached the size of a man it spread its wings as if to try their strength, then, soaring upward, it cried—'11 You have rescued me; take as a reward the ring that lay in the other egg; it is a wish-ring. Turn it on your finger twice, and whatever your wish is, it shall be fulfilled. But remember there is but a single wiBh in the ring. No sooner is that granted than it loses its power, and is only an ordinary ring. Therefore, consider well what you desire, so that you may never have reason to repent your choice."" So speaking, the eagle soared high in the air, circled over the farmer's head a few times, then darted, like an arrow, towards the east. The farmer took the ring, placed it on his finger, and turned on his way homeward. Toward evening he reached a town where a jeweller sat in his shop behind a counter, on which lay many costly rings for sale. The farmer showed his own, ana asked the merchant its value. ""It isn't worth a straw,"" the jeweller answered. Upon that the farmer laughed very heartily, and told the man that it waB a wish-ring, and of greater value than all the ringB in the shop together. The jeweller was a wicked, designing man, and so he invited the farmer to remain as his guest over night. ""For,"" he explained, "" only to shelter a man who owns a wish-ring must bring luck."" So he treated his guest to wine and fair words; and that night, as the farmer lay sound asleep, the wicked man stole the magic ring from his finger and slipped on in its place a common one","literary"

A Change of Weather.
Calm night, starry night, beautiful
night. Run up all tho sails, ply all tho
oars, and let the large boat and tho
small boat glide over gentle Geunesaret.
But the sailors say there is going to bo
a change of weather. And even the
passengers can hear the moaning of the
storm as it comes on with long stride,
with all the terrors of hurricane and
darkness. The large boat trembles like
a deer at bay trembling among tho
cluugor of the. hounds; great patches of
foam are rlung into the air; tho sails of
the vessels loosen, and the sharp winds
crack like pistols; the smaller boats
like petrels poise on the cliff of tho
waves and then plunge. Overboard go
cargo, tackling and masts, aud the
drenched disciples rush into tho back
part of the boat and lay hold of Christ
and say unto him, ""Master, carest thou
not that we perish?"" That great per?
sonage lifts his head from the pillow of
the fisherman's coat, walks to tho front
of tho vessel and looks out into tho
storm. All around him are tho smaller
boats, driven in tho tempest, aud
through it conies the cry of drowning
men. By the flash of the lightning I
seo the calm brow of Christ as tho
spray drcj pi:! from his beard. He has
one word lor tho sky aud another
word for the waves. Lookiug upward,
he cries, ""Peacel"" Looking downward,
he says, ""lie still I""
The waves fall lint on their faces, tho
foam melts, the extinguished stars re?

every voyage, Christ in every ship!
There are men who ask God to help
them at the start of great enterprises.
He has been with them in tho past. No
trouble can overthrow them. The storms
might come down from the top of Mount
Harmon and lash Geuuesaict into foam
aud into agony, but it could uot hurt
them. But here is auother man who
starts cut iu worldly enterprise, and ho
depeuds upou the uncertainties of this
life. He has no God to help him. After
awhile the storm comes and tosses off j
the masts of the ship. He puts out his
lifeboat. The KlinrifP and tl-.o niir.Hnnoer

try to help him off. They can't help
hinj off. He must go down?no Christ
in thu ship. Here are young men ju.it
starting out in Ufa Your lifo will bo
made up of sunshine and shadow. Tlioro
may lie iu it arctic: blasts or tropical
tornadoes. I know not what is before
you, but I know if yon have Christ with
you all shall be well.
You may seem to get aloug without
the religion of Christ whilo every?
thing goes .smoothly, but after awhile,
when sorrow hovers over the soul, when
the waves of trial dash clear over tho
hurricane deck and the bowsprit is shiv?
ered and the halyards are swept into
the sea anil the gangway is crowded
with piratical disasters ? oh, what
would you then do without Christ iu
the ship? Young man, take Cod for
your portion, God for your guide, God
for your help, then all is well?nil is
well tor rime; all shall be well forever.
Blessed is that man who puts iu tho
Lord his trust Hu shall never bo con­
founded.
Thun- Must IJ?.> Kongli Weather.
But my subject also impresses me
with the. fai r that when people start to
follow Christ they must not expect
smooth sailing These disciples got into
the small boats, and I have no doubt
they said: '? What a beautiful day this
is! What a smooth sea! What a bright
sky this is! How delightful is sailing
in this boat! And as for the waves un?
der the keel of the boat, why, they only
make the mot inn of our little boat tho
more delightful "" But when tho winds
swept down and the sea was tossed into
wrath, then they found that following
Christ was not smooth sailing. Ho you
have found it; so I havo found it. Did
yon ever notice tho end of tho life of
the apostles of Jesus Christ? You would
say that if ever men ought to have had
a smooth life, a smooth departure, then
those men, the disciples of Jesus Christ,
ought to have, bail such a departuro and
such a life.
St. .lames lost his head. St. Philip
was hung to death on a pillar, St. Mat?
thew had bis life dashed nut with a
halberd. St .Mark was drugged to death
through the streets St. James the Less
was beaten to death with a fuller's
club. St. Thomas was struck through
with a spear They did not find follow?
ing Christ smooth sailiug Oh, how
they were all tossed in the tempest I
Johu I hiss in the tire, Hugh McKail in
thu hour of martyrdom, thu Albiyensus,
tho Waldenses, the Scotch Covenanters
?did they find it smooth sailing?
.But why go to history when I can
find all around mo a score of illustra?
tions of the truth of this subject?that
y?ung man in the store trying to servo
God while his employer scoffs at Chris?
tianity, the young men in the samo
store antagonistic to tho Christian re?
ligion, teasing him, tormenting him
about his religion, trying to get him
mad? They succeed in getting him
iSHad, saying, ""You're- a pretty Chris?
tjan!"" Does this young man find it
Smooth sailing when ho tries to follow
Christ? Ih re is a Christian girl. Her
f.Cuthcr &lt;ji s [dsns the Christian religion;
hm mother despises tb*e Christian -re?
ligion* her brothers and sisters scoff at
the Christian religion; she can hardly
find a rpiiet place; in which co say her
prayers. Did slid find it smooth sailing
when she tried to foilow Jesus Christ?
Ob, no; all who would live the life of
the Christian religion must suffer per?
secution If you do not lind it in ono
way, yon will get it in another way
The question v. r.- asked, ""Who aro
these nearest the I r .ae?"" and the an?

in the blood of the Lamb. "" Ob, do not
be disheartened! O child of Cod, take
couragel You are in glorious compan?
ionship. Cod will see you through all
these trials, and he will deliver you.
My subject also impresses mo with
tho fact that good people sometimes get
very much frightened; In tho tones of
these disciples as they rushed into tho
back part of the boat 1 find they aro
frightened almost to death. The; say,
""Master; carest thou not that we per?
ish?"" They bad no reason to bu fright?
ened, for Christ was in thu boat. I sup?
pose if we had been there we would
have bceu just as much affrighted. Per?
haps mere.
No Need of Worry.
In all ages very good pe jplo get very
much affrighted. It is often so in our
day, and men say: ""Why, look at tho
bad lectures; look at the spiritualistic
societies; look at the various errors go?
ing over the church of God. We aro go?
ing to founder; the church is going lo
perish; she is going down."" Oh, how
many good people are affrighted by tri­
umphaut iniquity in our day and think
the church of Jesus Christ and tho
cause of righteousness are going to be
overthrown and ore just as much
affrighted as the disciples of my text
were affrighted. Don't worry, don't
fret, as though iniquity were going to
triumph over righteousness.
A lion goes into a cavern to sleep. He
lies down, with his shaggy mane cover?
ing the paws Meanwhile the spiders
spin a web across the mouth of the cav?
ern and say, ""We have captured him.""
Gossamer thread after gossamer thread
is spun until the whole front of the
cavcru is covered with the. spiders' web
and the spiders say, ""The lion is done;
the lion is fast."" After awhile the lion
has got through sleeping. He rouses him­
fclf, he shakes his mane, he walks out
into the sunlight, he docs not even
&amp;now the spiders'v.-eb is spun, and with
his voice he shakes the mountain.
So men come, spiuuing their sophis?
tries and skepticism about Jesus Christ.
He seems to be sleeping. They say:
""We have captured tho Lord. He will
never come forth again upon the nation.
Christ is captured, and captured for?
ever. His religion will never niako any
conquest among men."" But after awhile
the ""lion of tue tribe of Judah"" will
rouse himself and come forth to shako
mightily the nations. What is a spider's
web to the aroused lion? Give truth and
error a fair grapple, and truth will como
off victor.
But there arc a great many good peo-;
pie who get affrighted in other respects.
They are affrighted in our day about re-!
vivals. They say: ""Oh, this is a strong
religious gale! We are afraid the church
of Gcd is goiug to upset, and there are
going to be a great many people brought
into the church that are going to be of
no use to it."" And they are affrighted
whenever they see a revival taking hold
of the churches.
Chaff and Wheat.
As though a ship captain with 5.000

, uutuicis ci wueac wv a cargo snouia say
somo clay, coining upon dock, ""Throw
overboard all the cargo, "" and tho sailors
I should say: "" Why, captaiu, what do
yon moan? Throw over all the cargo?""
""Oh,"" says the captain, ""wo have a
peek of ebuff that has got into this 5,000
bushels of wheat, aud tho only way to get}
I rid of the chaff is to throw all the j
I wheat overboard. "" Now, that is a grout
deal wiser than the talk of a great many
Christians who want to throw overboard
all the thousands and tens of thousands
of souls who have been brought in
through great awakenings. Throw all
overboard because thero is a peck of
chal?, a quart of chaff, a pint of chair""!
I say, let them stay until tho last day.
The Lord will divide tho chaff from tho
wheat.
Oh, that theso gales from heaven
might sweep through all our ehurchesl
Oh, for sueh days as Richard Baxter
i saw iu England aud Robert McCheyne
saw in Dundee! Oh, for such days as
Jonathan Edwards saw in Northamp?
ton! I have often heard my father tell
of the fact that in the early part of this
century a revival broke out in Soiner­
ville, N. J., and some people were very
much agitated about it. They said,
""Oh, you are going to briug too many
people into tho church at once!"" and
they sent down to New Brunswick to
get John Livingstou to stop tho revival.
Well, there was no better soul iu all
the world than John Livingston. Ho
went up; ho looked at the revival. They
wanted him to stop it. Ho stood iu the
pulpit on the Sabbath and looked over
the solemn auditory, and ho said:
""This, brethren, is in reality tho work
of God Beware how you try to stop
it."" And he was an old man, leaning
heavily on his staff?a very old man.
And ho lifted that staff and took hold
of the small end of tho staff aud began
to let it fall very slowly through be?
tween the linger and the thumb, and ho
said, ""Oh, thou impenitent, thou art
falling now?falling away from life,
falling away from peaco and heaven,
falling as certainly as that cane is fall?
ing through my hand?falling certain?
ly, though perhaps falling vory slowly I""
And the cane kept on falling through
John Livingston's hand. Tho religious
emotion iu tho audience was overpow?
ering, aud men saw a type of their
doom as the cane kept falling and fall?
ing until the knob of the cane struck Mr.
Livingston's hand, aud he clasped it
stoutly and said, ""But tho grace of God
can stop yon,as 1 stopped that cane,"" and
then thero was gladness all through tho
house at the fact of pardon and peaco
and salvation. ""Weil,"" said the peoplo
after the service, ""I guess you had bet?
ter send Livingston home. Ho is mak?
ing the revival worse."" Oh, for tho
gales from heaven, and Christ on board
the ship! The danger of tho church of
God is not in revivals.
Again, my subject impresses me with
the fact that Jesus was God and man iu
the same being Here he is iu tho back
part of the beat. Oh, how tired he
looks, what sad dreams ho must have!
Look at his countenance. He must bo
thinking'of the cross ro Come. Look at
him. Ho ?s a man?bouo of our bone,
HcEh of our flesh. Tired, he falls asleep;
ho is a man. But then I find Christ at
the prow of tho boat. I hear him say,
""Peace, be still!"" And I see the storm
kuecling at his feet and tho tempests
folding their wings in his presence. He
is a God.
If I have sorrow and trouble aud waut
sympathy, I go and kneel down at tho
back part of the boat and say, ""0
Christ, weary one of Genuesaret, sym?
pathize with all my sorrows, man of
Nazareth, man of the cross. "" A man, a
man But if I want to conquer my spir?
itual foes, if I want to get tho victory
over sin, death and hell, I eoine to tho
front of the boat and 1 kneel down, and
I say, ""? Lord Jesus Christ, thou who
dost hush the tempest, hush all my
grief, hush all my temptation, hush all
my sin. "" A man, a man, a God, a God.
Tho Tempest Hushed.
I Jearn ouce more from this subject
that Christ can hush a tempest. It did
seem as if everything must go to ruin.
The disciples had given up the idea of
managing the ship. The crew were en?
tirely demoralized, yet Christ rises, and
ho puts his foot on the storm, aud it
crouches at his feet. Oh, yes, Christ
ran hush the tempest!
I You havo had trouble Perhaps it
was the little child taken away from
yon?the sweetest child of the house?
hold, tho one who asked the most curi­
ousquestions and stood around you with
the greatest fondness, and the spade cut
down through your bleeding heart. Per?
haps it was an only son, and your heart
has ever since been like a desolated cas?
tle, the owls of the night hooting amoug
the falliug rafters aud the crumbling
stairways.
Perhaps it was an aged mother You
always went to her with your troubles. ,
She was in your home to welcome your
children into life, and when they died
she was there to pity you That old
hand will do yon no more kindness.
That white lock of hair yon put away
in the casket or iu the lovket did not
look as well ?.a it usually did when she
brushed it away from her wrinkled
brow iu the home circlo or iu the couu­
try church. Or, your property gcuo, you
said, ""I have so much bank stock, I
have so many gove:nment securities, I
havo so many houses, I have so many
farms""?all gone, all gone.
Why, all tho storms that ever tram?
pled with their thunders, all tho ship?
wrecks, havo not been worso than this
to you. Yet you have not been com?
pletely overthrown. Why? Christ hushed
the tempest. Your little one was taken
away. Christ says: ""I have that little
one. I can take care of him as well as
I you can, heiter thau yon can, oh, be?
reaved mother!"" Hushing tho tempest!
When your property went away, God
I said, ""There are treasures in heaven,
iu bauks that ucver break.""
There is one storm into which we
will all havo to run the momcut when
we let go of this lifo and try to take
hold of the next, when we will waut
all the price we cau have?we will
want it all. Yoi'der I seo a Christian
! soul rockiug on the surges of death.
; All the powers of darkness seem let out
against that sou!?tho swirling wave,
! the thunder of the sky, the screaming
wind, all seem to unite together?but
that soul is not troubled, there is no
sighing, there are no tears; plenty of
tears in the room at the departure, but
he weeps no tears; calm, satisfied,
peaceful, all is well. Jesus hushing
the tempest! By the flash of the storm
you see the harbor just ahead, and you
are making for that harbor Strike
eizht bells. All is well.

Into the harbor of heaven now wo ghde.
We're homo at last, homo at last.
Softly we drift on its bright, silv'ry tide,
Wo'ro homo ut last, homo at last.

Wonders of the InUnlteaiiual.
There aro so very raauy things other­
wiso unknowable which the little in?
strument helps us to know well, which
would forever be in tho realm of ""the
infinite"" were it not for that tiny bit of
convex glass, that nothing should sur?
prise us iu its revelations.
Tako, for example, tho red corpuscles
of the human blood. Oue thirty-two­
hundredth of an inch is its diame?
ter. Ouo hundred-and-twenty-one-thou­
snndths of tho entiro blood quantity is
red corpuscles. They are individually
so minute that it requires a microscope
of considerable power to see them at
all, and yet their number is such in ouo
man thut if a chain were made of them,
each corpuscle just touching its neigh?
bor, it would be over 2,000 miles long.
Three gallons of blood in a man of
140 pounds weight is a fair average,
and 0.381 of a gallon of the above is
red globules. Ouo cubic inch of these
corpuscles made into a chain of a single
corpuscle's breadth would be 3,200 times
3,200 inches long, or 1,100,000 inches.
As there are 231 cubic inches in a gal?
lon 0.3S1 of 231 would give the cubio
measure of red globules in the above
man. Thus l.UOO.OUO times 88 gives
140,800,000 iuches. Reduced to miles
this equals,counting 03,300 iuches to the
mile, 2,222 miles. The little invisible
red corpuscles or oxygen carriers of our
blood would then, if ""hitched"" together
iuto a chain, reach two-thirds across
tho American continent A single hair
from one's head would make in caliber
very many fibers as large.
And yet, small as these corpuscles
arc, they are giauts when compared
with many well known individuals of
the bacterial world. Think of a body
which has to be magnified 800 diame?
ters to be visible at all. You have here
some of the monococci. Yes, and these
inconceivably small bodies are endowed
with lifo, organization aud means of
propagation.?Microscope.
Tiie Drag Rope of tho Balloon.
It is_ not generally known that the
drag rope, now so indispensable to bal-1
loonists, was first used by Aeronaut
Samuel King of this city. ""The idea of
using such a rope,"" says Professor
King, ""was first suggested by the fa?
mous Green of England. He called it a
guido rope, and he carried one with him
in a trip across tho English channel,
but hu never used it. Away back in
1S57 I was making 'captive ascensions'
at Now Haven, and, having finished
that business, decided to take a short
voyage to test the value of the trailing
rope 1 had I"";U pounds of rope on my
windlass, and on a certain day I ar?
ranged with my assistant to cut the
rope at the wiudlass after I had got my
balloon in the air aud let me sail off. I
ballasted my balloou so thatunly half
tho weight of the rope, or 75 pounds,
should trail. I got off all right, with
my rope twisting along under me like a
snake A score of misguided laborers in j
a field, imagining that the balloou had
broken loose by accident, grabbed the1
rope aud held me It took mo some
time to convince them th-t I didn't
want to be stopped I sailed along for
some time and fouud that the drag rope
gave greater stability to the balloon,
but tho action of tho sun upon tho gas
worked against me The sun's heat, ex­
paudiug the gas, gave me a false buoy­
aucy, picked up my 75 pouuds of rope
aud severed my connection with the
ground. After that I used the drag rope
very frequently, and it was generally
adopted by aeronauts. ""?Philadelphia

denounce a breach of the peace so
enormous and transcending as the
one now claiming our attention. A
more barbarous, direful, marked,
and malicious assault a more wil­

The following, taken from the Burling­

this community as for that of any other, and
accordingly wo give it place in our columns :
“And then remember, son, that the world
is older than you are liy several years; that
for thousands of years it lias been so full of
smarter and better young men than yourself
that their feet stuck out of the dormer window;
that when they died the old globe went whirl­
ing on, and not one man in ten million went
to the funeral or even heard of Ids dentil. Be
as smart as you can of course. Know as
much as you can, of course. Know as much
as you can, without blowing the packing out
of your cylinder heads; shell the light of your
wisdom abroad in the world, but don’t dazzle
people with it. And don’t imagine a thing is
so simple because you say it is. Don’t lie
sorry for your father because bo knows so
much less than you do; rcmcmlier the reply
of Dr. Wayland to the student of Brown’s
University, who said it was an easy enough
thing to make proverbs such as Solomon
wrote. ‘Make a few,’ tersely replied the old
man. And we never beard that the young
man made any. Not more than two or three,
anyhow. The world has great need for young
men, hut no greater need than the ymmg men
have of it. Your clothes fit you heller Hum
your father’s lit him ; they cost more money,
they are more stylish, your moustache is neat­
er, the cut ol your hair is belter, and
you are prettier, oh, far prettier limn ‘pa.’
Hut, young man, the old gentleman gels
the biggest salary, and Ids homely, scramb­
ling signs lure on the business end of
a cheek will drain more money out of
the bank in live minutes, than you can gel
out with a ream of paper and a eopperplaied

In St. Paul's, where he and his father and brother acoom­
panted the Duchess of Kent and the Princess there on the
a
occasion of the service attended by the children of the
different charity schools. t Its indeed raro to se a prince,
not yet 17 years of age, bostowing such earnest attentlon a
on a sermon,"" a
It was probably in the early part of 1838 that the King t
of the Belgians, in writing to the Queecn, first mentioned
the idea of such a marriage. Both the Prince and hUS
father seem to have objected fromthe first to the proposal d
that a few years should elapse before the marriage should I
take place, he being then eighteen years of age, ""' I aum h
ready,"" he said to King Leopold, ""to submit to this a
delay if I have only some certain assurance to go upon. a
But id after waiting perhaps for three years I should find e
that the Queen no longer desired the marriage, it would s
place me iu a very ridiculous position, and would to a
certain extent ruin all the prospects of my future life,"" 'h
The Queen says she never entertained any idea of this, nd a
she afterwards repeatedly informed the Prince that she s
would never have married anyone else. She expresses,
however, great regret that she had not af ter her accession d
kept up her correspondence with her cousin as she had Z
done before it. ""Nor can the Queen now,"" she adds, f
""Think without indignation against herself of her wish h
to keep the Prince waiting for probably three or four years, d
at the risk of ruining all his prospects for life, or until she
might feel inolined to meTry ! And thePrInce has since told
her that hecame over in 1833 with the intention of tellirg
her that 11 she could not then make up her mind she must
understand that he could not now wait forP a decision, as o
he had done at a former period when this marriage was d
first talked about. The only excuse the Queen can make
for herself is In the fact that the sudden change from the
secluded life at Kensington to the independence of her
position as Queen regnant, at the age of eighteen, put all a
ideas of marriage out of her mind, which she now most r
bitterly repents. A worse school for a young girl, or one
more detrimental to all natural feelings and affections,
cannot Nvell be Imagined than the position 0t a Qaeen at I
eighteen without experienee, and without a husband to B
guide nud support her. This the Queen can state from y
painful exrperience, end she thanks God that none of her
dear daughters are exposed to such danger.""q
In October, 1S39, the visit to England was paid, which l
decided the fate of the young Prinoc's life. Prince Albert c
was accompanied by his brother, and both were charged
with a letter from the King of the Belgians to the Queen'
in which he recommended them to her kindness, ""They
are good and honest creatures, deserving your kindnsos,
and not pedantic, but really sensible and trustworthy. I
have told them that your great wish Is that they should
be quite vnrcffngpen (quite at their ease) with you, I am

Burials alive are far more common in

In Spain the body is frequently re
moved to the undertaker's shop a few
hours after death. In one of the largest
of these establishments in Madrid, soma
years ago, an extraordinary sight was
.witnessed. A gentleman was brought
in in his casket : one afternoon and
placed in the room set apart for that
branch of the' business. The proprietor
lived over his premises, and on this
especial evening was giving a grand
ball. When ihe ball was at its height
a gentleman in full evening dress sud
denly joined., tbe company, lie danced
with the wife of the undertaker, and hs
danced with the undertaker's daughter,
and seemed to be thoroughly enjoying
himself.
The undertaker thought he knew his
face, but did not like to be rude and ask
him his name. .But by and by all tha
guests departed, and the strange gentle­
man was the only one left,
""Shall I send a cab for you?"" said tha
host at last.
""No, thank you,"" replied the gentle
man; ""I'm staying in the house.""
""Staying in the house!"" exclaimed the
undertaker. ""Who are you, sir?"".
""What! Don't you know me? I am
the corpse that was brought in this
afternoon.""
The undertaker, horrified, rushed to
the mortuary room, and found the coffin
empty. His wife vand daughter had
been dancing with a corpse. An expla­
nation, of course, followed. The gentle
man, who had only been in a trance,
had suddenly recovered, and hearing
music and revelry above, and having a
keen sense of humor, had got out of
his coffin the Spanish coffin closes with
a lid,, which 4s only locked just previous
to interment and joined the festiva
party. He was quite presentable, as in

Miss C. was born only two years
earlier than her brother Tom. When
Tom was ten years old she gloried
because she was twelve when Tom
was known to be fourteen she con­
fessed to sweet sixteen when Tom
proudly boasted of eighteen she tim­
idly acknowledged herself past nine­
teen when Tom came home from
college with a moustache and a vote,
and had a party in honor of his
twenty-first birthday, she said to her
friends:
""What a boyish fellow he is! Who
would think that he is only a year
younger than I?""
""When Tom declared he was twenty­
live, and old enough to get married,
she said to an intimate friend.
""Do you know, I feel savagely
jealous to think of Tom getting mar­
ried. But then, I suppose twins are
always more attached to each other
than other brothers and sisters.""

And two yea rs later, at Tom's, wed­
ding, she said, with girlish vivacity,
to the wedding guests:
""Dear old Toml to see him married
to-night, and then to think how,
when he was only five years old, they
brought him to see me, his baby sis­
ter! I wonder if bethinks of it to­
day?""

A TEAR HANDKERCHIEF.
I From the Philadelphia Press.)
1 A beautiful and peculiar custom still
prevails in some parts of the Tyrol.
When a girl is going to be married,
before she leaves her homo to go to ihe
church, her mother gives hvr a hand­
kerchief, which is called the ""tear
handkerchief"" It is made of newly
' spun linen and has never beeu used.
It is wilh this that she dries her tears
j when she leaves her father's bouse aud
I when she stands at the altar. After
; the marriage is over and the bride has
i gone with her husband to their new
homo, she lolds up the handkerchief
ami places it unwashed iu tho liueu
closet, whero it remains untouched.
Up to now it has done only half Us
duty. Children are born, grow up,
marry, and go away to their new
homes, each daughter receiving a tear
. handkerchief from tho mother. Her
owu still remaius where it was placed
iu the linen closet the day ot her mar­
riage. (Jeuerations come and go. The
once voting, rosy bride has become a
wrinkled old woman. She may have
outlived her husband and all hor chil­
dren. All her old friends mav have
. died off, aud yet that last present she
received Irom her mother has not ful­
' tilled its object. It comos at last,
. though at last tho weary eyelids close
! for their long sleep, aud the tired,
wrinkled hands aro folded over the
pulseless heart. Aud then the tear
handkerchief is taken from ils loi.g
resting piano and spread over the
placid features ot the dead. This may
have made you feel somewhat sad

It ditl to mine when I first heard it,

noll at u Cbild'w Grave.
Washington, Jan. 6. In a re­
mote corner of the cougressionai
cemetery this atternoou, with un­
covered heads, were ranged around
a newly-opened grave a small group
of the friends of Detective and Mrs.
George O. Miller, who had gathered
to witness the burial ot their bright
little son Harry, u recent victim of
dipthena. As the casket rested
upon the trestles there was a pain­
ful pause, brokeu only by the mo
ther's sobs, uniil the undertaker ad
vanced toward a stout, florid-coni'
plexioucd gentleman m the party,
and whispered to him, the words
beiug inaudible to the lookers-on,
This gentleman was Col. Robert G
lugersoll, a friend of the Millers,
who attended the funeral at their
request. He shook his head when
the undertaker first addressed him,
and then said suddenly: ""Docs Mr.
Miller desire it?"" The undertaker
gave an affirmative nod, Mr. Miller
looked appealingly towards the
noted orator, and Colonel Ingersoll
advanced to the side of the grave,
made a motion denoting a desire
for silence, and in a voice of ex­
quisite cadence delivered one of his
characteristic eulogies lor the dead
The scene was intensely uramntic.
A fine drizzling rain was falling,
and every head was bent and every
ear turned to catch the words of
eloquence and hope that, fell from
the lips of the distinguished speaker.
Colonel Ingersoll was unprotected
by cither hat or umbrella, and his
invocation thrilled his hearers with
awe, each eye that had previously
been bediinmod wilh tears bright­
ening, and sobs becoming hushed.
COLONEL INUEKSOLL'S OltATION.
Colonel Ingersoll said :
""My friend's, I know how vain it
is to gild a grief with words, and
yet I wish to take from every grave
its fear. Herein this world, where
life and death arc equal kings, all
should be brave enough to meet
what all the dead have met The
future has been filled with fear­
stained and polluted by the heart­
less past. From the wondrous tree
of life the buds and blossoms fall
with ripened fruit, and in the com­
mon bed of earth the patriarchs and
babes sleep side by side. Why
should we fear that which will come
to all ? That is, we cann&amp;t tell, we
do not know, which is the greater
blessing life or death. We can­
not say that death is not
a good conditiou. We do not
know whether the grave is the
end of this life or the door
of another ; . or, whether the
night here is not somewhere else a
dawn. Neither can we tell which
is the more fortunate, the child dy­
ing iu his mother's arms before its
lips have learned to form a word, or
he who journeys all the length of
life's uneven road, painfully taking
the last slow steps with stall and
crutch. Every cradle asks us
'Whence 3 and every coffin
'Whither?' :The poor barbarian,
weeping o er his dead, can answer
thc6C questions as intelligently aud
satisfactorily a3 the robed priest of
the most authentic creed. The tear­
ful iguoranco of the one is just as
consoling as the learned ""aud un­
meaning words of the other. No man,
standing where the horizon of a life
has touched a grave, has any right
to prophesy a future filled with pain
and tears, it may be that death gives
all there is ot worth to life. If
those we press and strain against
our hearts could never die, perhaps
that love would wither from the
earth. May be tbis common"" fate
treads from out the paths between
our hearts the weeds of selfishness
and hate, and I had rather live and
love where death is king than have
eternal life where lovo is not
Another life is naught unless we
know and love again the ones who
love us here They who stand with
breaking hearts around this little
grave need have no fear. The larger
and nobler faith in all that is and is
to be, tells us that death, even at its
worst, is only perfect rest
We know that through the com­
mon wants of life the neeus and
duties of each hour their grief will
lesson day by day, until at last the
grave will be to them a place of rest
and peace almost of joy. Thero is
for them this consolation the dead
do not sutler. If they live again,
their lives will surely be as good as
ours, who have no fear. We are all

N COMPLIANCE with the re­
quest of a friend of mine, who
wrote me from the East, I
called on good-natured, gur­
rulous old Simon Wheeler, and inquired
after my friend's friend. Leonidas W.
Smiley', as requested to do, and I here­
unto append the result. I have a lurk­
ing suspicion that Leonidas W. Smiley
is a myth; that my friend never knew
such a personage; and that he only
conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler
about him, it would remind him of his
infamous Jim Smiley, and he would
go to work and bore me to death with
some exasperating reminiscence of him
as long and as tedious as it should be
useless to me. If that was the design,
it succeeded.
I found Simon Wheeler dozing com­
fortably by the bar-room stove of the
dilapidated tavern in the decayed min­
ing camp of Angel's, and I noticed
that he was fat and bald-headed, and
had an expression of winning gentle­
ness and simplicity upon his tranquil
countepance. He. roused up and gave
me good-day. I told him a friend of
mine had commissioned me to make
some inquiries about a cherished com­
panion of his boyhood named Leonidas
W. Smiley-Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley,
a young minister of the gospel, who
he had heard was at one time a resi­
dent of Angel's Camp. I added that
if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything
about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley,
I would feel under many obligations
to him.

Simon Wheeler backed me into a con- letel
ner and blockaded me there with his he'd
chair, and then sat down and reeled ne
off the monotonous narrative which neve
follows this paragraph. but
He never smiled, he never frowned, frog
he never changed his voice from the lea
punt
gentle-flowing key to which he tuned you'
his initial sentence, he never betrayed like
the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; sum
but all through the interminable narra- got
tive there ran a vein of impressive him
earnestness and sincerity, which flies
showed me plainly that, so far from stan
his imagining that there was anything a.l
ridiculous or funny about his story, he he c
regarded it as a really important mat- liev
ter. and admired its two heroes as men Dai

him go on in his own way, and never flie

""Rev. Leonidas W. H'mn, Reverend off

he could get anybody to bet on the wo
other side; and if he couldn't he'd stri
change sides. Any way that suited the mil
other man would suit him-any way an(
just so's he got abet, he was satisfied. Ove
But still he was lucky, uncommon liti
lucky; he most always come out win- hii
ner. He was always ready and laying a b
for a chance; there couldn't be no sol- the
it'ry thing mentioned but what that Wi
feller'd offer to bet on it, and take arry
side you please, as I was just telling
you. If there was a horse race, you'd
find him flush or you'd find him lik
basted at the end of it; if there was a be
dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was on
a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there
was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; at
why, if there was two birds setting on we
a fence, he would bet you which one We
would fly first; or if there was a camp­
meeting, he would be there reg'lar to les
bet on Parson Walker,which he judged I F
to be the best exhorter about here. and fri
so he was too, and a good mlian. If
he even see a straddle-bug start to go tot
anywhert', he would bet you how long ga
it would take him to get to-to wher- de
ever he was going to, and if you took nc
him up, he would follow that straddle- be
bug to Mexico but what he would find
out where he was bound for and how '`
long he was on the road. Lots of the be
boys here has seen that Smiley, and ye
can tell you about him. Why, he ai
never made no difference to him-he'd w
bet on any thing-the danugdest feller. fe
Parson Walker's wife laid vei'y sick fr
once, for a good while, and it seemed
as if they waru't going to save her; a
but one morning he come in, and Smi- I'
ley up and asked him how she was, g9
uund he said she was considable better y
--thank the Lord for His inf'nite
mercy-and coining on so smart that ri
with the blessing of Prov'dence she'd n
get well yet; and Smiley, before lie a
thought, says, 'Well, I'll resk two-and- b
a-half she don't, anyway.'
""Thish-yer Smiley had a mare-the
boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, i
. but that was only in fnu, you know,
because of course she was faster than t
that-and, he used to win money on c
that horse, for all she was so slow and 1:
always had the asthma, or the distem- f
per, or the consumption, or something s
of that kind. They used to give her t
two or three hundred yards' start, and a
then pass her under way; but always t
at the fag-end of the race she'd get ex­
cited and desperate-like, and come ca- f
vorting and straldling up. and spatter­
ing her legs around limber, s unetimes t
in the air, and somnetinmes oit to one t
side among the fences, and kicking up I
m.o-r-e dust and raising in-o-r-e­
racket with her coughing and sneez­
ing, and blowing her nose-and always
fetch up at the stand just about a neck
ahead, as near as you could cipher it
down.
""And he had a little small bull-pup,
that to look at him you'd think he

warn't worth a cent but to set around tot
and look ornery, and lay for a chance the
to steal something. But as soon as
money was up on him he was a differ- at.
ent dog; his under jaw'd begin to stick on
ant like the fo'castle of a steamboat, thi
and his teeth would uncover and shine Di
like the furnaces. And a dog might 'Vi
tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite ab
him, and throw him over his shoulder an
two or three times, and Andrew Jack­
son-which was the name of the pup- an
Andrew Jackson would never let on but tit
what he was satisfied, and hadn't ex- wi
pected nothing else-and the bets being off
doubled and doubled on the other side th
all the time, till the money was all up; to
and then all of a sudden he would grab he
that other dog jest by the j'int of his ne
hind leg and freeze to it-not chaw, bli
you understand, but only just grip and pc
hang on till they throwed up the sponge, an
if it was a year. Smiley always come of
out winner on that pup, till he har- an
nessed a dog once that didn't have no th
hind legs, because they'd been sawed fe
off in a circular saw, and when the A
thing had gone along far enough, and
the money was all up, and he come to cI
make a snatch for his pet holt, he see to
in a minute how he'd been imposed on, in
and how the other dog had him in the
door, so to speak, and he 'peared sur at
prised. and then he looked sorter dis- a
touraged-like, and didn't try no more
to win the fight, and so, he got shucked ti
out bad. He gave Smiley a look, as ti
much to say his heart was broke, and w
it was his fault, for putting up a dog fc
that hadn't no hind legs for him to di
take holt of, which was his main de­
pendence in a fight, and then he iS
limped off a piece and laid down and In
died. It was a good pup, was that
Andrew Jackson, and would have o0
made a name for hisself if he'd lived, oa
for the stuff was in himt and he had n
genius-I know it, because he hadn't
no opportunities to speak of, and it cJ
don't stand to reason that a dog could ti
make such a fight as he could under
them circumstances if he hadn't no
talent. It always makes me feel sorry
when I think of that last fight of his'n. ,
and the way it turned out.
""Well, this-yer Smiley had rat­
tarriers and chicken cocks, and tom­
cats, and all them kind of things, till
you couldn't rest, and you couldn't
fetch nothing for him to bet on but I
he'd match you. He ketched a frog 1I
one day, and took him home, and said c
he cal'lated to educate him; and so he
never done nothing for three months
but set in his back yard and learn that
frog to jump. And you bet he did
learn him, too. He'd give him a little
punch behind, and the next minute
you'd see that frog whirling in the air
1 like a doughnut-see him turn one
summerset, or may be a couple, if he I
got a good start, and come down fiat­
footed and all right, like a cat. He got
0 him up so in the matter of ketching
i flies, and kep' him in practice so con­
stant, that he'd nail a fly every time
as fur as he could see him. Smiley said
all a frog wanted was education, and
a he could do 'most anything-and I be­
lieve him. Why, I've seen him set
Dan'l Webster down here on this floor
-Dan'l Webster was the name of the
t frog - and sing out, 'Flies, Dan'l,
r flies I' and quicker'n you could wink
he'd spring straight up and snake a fly
d off'n the counter there, and flop down
on the floor ag'in as solid as a gob of
1 mud, and fall to scratching the side of
his head with his hind foot as in­
e different as if he hadn't no idea he'd
been doin' more'n any frog might do.
You never see a frog so modest and
Le straightfor'ard as he was, for all he
)- was so gitted. And when it come to
't fair and square jumping on a dead
a level, he could get over more ground at
one straddle than any animal of his
breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead
- level was his strong suit, you under­
if stand; an when it come to that, Smuiley
would ante up money on him as long
as he had a red. Smiley was mon­
d strous proud of his frog, and well he
le might be, for fellers that had traveled
y and been everywheres, all said he laid
over any frog that ever they see.
n ""Well Smiley kep' the bea.t in a
little lattice box, and he used to fetch
Shnim down town sometimes and lay for
ig a bet. One day a feller-a straugre in
i. the camp, he was-come acrost him
t with his box, and says:
"" 'What might it be that you've got
y in the box?'

""And Smiley says, sorter ir:'i'o""uent L
like, 'It might be a parror, i, : ish.,, t l
be a canary, maybe, buGt i: .in;--:,'i
only just a frog.'
""'And the feller took it and looked ,
at it careful, and turned it round this b
way and that, and says, 'H'm-so 'tis. ii
Well, what's he good for? d
"" 'Well.' Smiley says, easy and care- E
less, 'he's good enough for one thing, s
I should judge-he can outjump any f,
frog in Calaveras county. '
""The feller took the box again, and
took another long, particular look, and
gave it back to Smiley, and says, very
deliberate, 'Well.' he says, 'I don't see
no p'ints about that frog that's any 1
better'u any other frog.'
"" 'Maybe you don't,' Smiley says. r
'Maybe you understand frogs and may- s
be you don't understand 'em; maybe
you've had experience, and maybe you I
ain't only a amature, as it were. Any­
Sways, I've got my opinion and I'll resk I
forty dollars that he can outjump any
frog in Calaveras county.'

have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not

There is no unkindness here, for He could
not speak unkiudlv neither is there any
harshness. If we understood their customs
better we would better understand their
language, but let no Sunday school scholar
even for one moment tolerate the thought
that Jesus could speak harshly or unkindly
to His mother. The last clause of the verse
reminds us that He has an hour and a time
for everything.
5. ""His mother saith unto the servants,
Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.""

His mother evidently understood Him to'
mean that He would see to it in due time,
and therefore instructed the servants, ac­
cordingly. Pharaoh said unto the Egyp­
tians, ""Go unto Joseph what he saith to
you, do."" Jacob's wives said unto him,
""Whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do""
(Gen. xli, 55 xxxi, 16). If the question of
our lives concerning everything was
""What has the Lord said?"" and our deter­
mination ""That only will we do!"" how
safely we would walk and how successful­
ly we would work!
6. ""And there were set there six water
pots of stone, after the manner of the puri­
fying of the Jews, containing two or three
firkins apiece.""

It is evident from the next verse that
these vessels were empty, and thus we are
reminded of the kind of vessels which Je^us
can use. To be willing to be empty, clean
and always ready to the Master's hand is
to be where we will be of some use to
Him it is the privilege of every believer
to be ""a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and
meet for the Master's use, and prepared
unto every good work"" (n Tim. ii, 21).
7. ""Jesus saith unto them, Fill the water
pots with water. And they filled them up
to the brim.""

The servants were ready, the order was
given and promptly obeyed. Ready and
prompt obedience is required of us and
ought to be our constant habit. Vessels
must receive before they can give the use
of vessels is to receive and give, not to re­
ceive only, but to receive in order to give.
8. ""And He saith unto them, Draw out
now, and bear unto the governor of the
feast. And they bare it.""

How very soon the vessels, so recently
receivers, become givers—and why not?
But ask yourself, dear reader, ""Am I a
giver?"" and if not, ""Why not?"" ""Have t""
received nothing?""
9. ""When the ruler of the feast had
tasted the water that was made wine, and
knew not whence it was (but the servants
which drew the water knew), the ruler of

The water had become wine—""He made

before:
A few days ago 1 was standing
by an American gentleman, when
I expressed a wish to know which
point was north. He at once pulled
oat his watch, looked at.it, and
pointed to the north. I asked him
whether he had a compass attached
to his watch.
""All watches,"" he replied, ""are
compasses.""
.Then he explained to me quite
clearly how this was.
Point the hour hand to the sun,
and the south is just half way
between the hour and the figure
XII on the watch. For instance,
suppose that it is four o'clock.
Point the hand indicating four to
the sun, and II on the watch is
exactly south. Suppose that it is
eight o'clock; point the hand indi­
cating eight to the sun, and the
figure X on the watch is due south.
My American friend was quite
surprised that I did not know this.
Thinking that very possibly I was
ignorant of a thing that everyone
else knew, and happening to meet
Mr. Stanley, I asked that eminent
traveler whether he was aware of
this simple mode of discovering

I go a little further on in your house and
I find the mother's chair. It is very apt to
be a rocking chair.. She had so many
cares and troubles to soothe that it must
have rockers. I remember it well; it was
an old chair, and the rockers were almost
airorn out, for I was the youngest, and the

cnair bad rocked the whole family. It
niade a creaking noise as it moved; tiut
there wag mimic in the sound. It was i iat

I high enough to' allow us children to put
our beads into her lap. That was the bank
where we deposited all our hurts and wor­
ries. Ah! what a chair that was. : It was
different from the father's chair; it was en­
tirely different. Vou ask me bowf I can
not tell; but . we all felt it was differ­
ent. Perhaps there was about this ck.-iir
more gentleness, more teuderness, more !
grief when we had done wrong. When we
were wayward father scolded, hut mother
cried. It was : a very wakeful chair.. In
the sick days of children other chairs
could not keep awake; that chair always
kept awake kept easily awake. The cLiur
knew all the old lullabies and all those
wordless sougs which mothers sing to their
sick children songs in which all pity and
compassion and sympathetic influences are
combined. - ...
That old chair has stopped rocking for a
good many years. It may be set np in the

power yet. When at midnight yon weut

invalid's chair. What! How long have

What a story of endurance. There are in

any oue on the ground.
Oh, what a means of grace to tbe world,

AN OLD STORY OF ITS WONDERFUL INFLU­
ENCE RETOLD,
'You have heard,' said a youth to a mai­
den who stood beside him as ho sat on a
corn-sheaf one evening about quitting time :
'you have heard, I dare say, of the Danish
boy's whistle of wood ? I would rIvo two
dollars and a half If that Danish boy's
whistle were mine.'
The maiden had heard of the wonderful
things which could be accomplished by
means of the magic whistle, and, coloring
slightly, said s
'And what would you do with It ?' while
n smile played over her-benutiful face, ex­
tending clear round to her cars.
'I would blow it,' he' answered, 'and then
my fair maid would fly to my side and sit
dowrrpn the same corn-sheaf with me, which
'would make mo extremely happy, and make
it a matter of supreme Indifference to me
whether school kept or not, or how much
com mado a bushel.'
'Is that all yon wish It for?' exclaimed
the maid, with n laugh that started a convey
of birds in the next row, 'That may be
yours without' any magic, Charlie. A favor
so slight one could not find In one's heart to
deny, you know, and sho playfully seated
herself by his side and drummed with her
little heel in the furrow.
'I would blow it again,' said theyouth,
who had begun to boo how matters were
drifting. '1 would blow tho thing agafii
and tho one fair woman beneath the sun
could not resist the charm, and would lay
her fair arm upou my shoulder,'
She smiled and laid her fair arm round
his neck.
The young man was takenjcompletely by
surprise, but managed to bear up under it,
although, as he confessed to the writer, It
was by all odds the greatest effort of his
life.
A young man of his age is never satisfied
but is always reaching out and grasping af­
ter the unattainable, as it were, and afler
drinking in for a moment the nectar of the
situation so to speak, exclaimed :
Yet once more would I blow it. This
time I would give it the awfulest blast that
was ever heard this side. of the crack of
doom; the music divine would .bring me the
third timo an unspeakable pleasure. She
would lay her fair check to this brown one
of mine and her lips stealing past mine would
give mo a kiss, I'm quite -sure ; at least I
hope so,'
Tho young lady laughed out in her inno­
cent glee, just as any other youug lady would
do under the same circumstances end said ;
'What a fool of yourself you'd make with
your whistle, bo sure 1 Now just consider
for a moment how silly it would be to sit on
a corn-sheaf, liko a knot on a log, and crack
your cheeks whistling for what you might
lako !'
. T.,is almost took tho young man's breath.
He immediately reached for the love­
ly creature, but, strange to relate did not
find her. She had anticipated him, and was
already breaking through tho cornstalks for
home while her laughter floattd back upon
his ears remluding him that he had an en­
gagement at home to gnaw a file. Detroit

THE AEXAHSAW TRAVELLER.
THE ORIGINAL AMU9ING STOUT.
The original Arkansaw Traveller was
not precisely the same character that
rraut Uuanfrau presents on the stage.
In fact, his name was not ""Kit,"" but
""Sandy, and be never bad a wife
killed and a child stolen from him. dur­
ing his terrestrial existence. The Ar­
kansaw Traveller's name was Colonel
Sandy Faulkner, ahd be was born in
Georgetown, Ky., in 1808. A corres
pondent says be came to Arkansas in
lay. ana settled in tmcot (Jountv, on
the Mississippi Kiver, as a cotton plant
er. In 1839 Colonel I aulkncr, with his
father, the late Nicholas Faulkner, a
Virginian by birth, took up his resi­
dence in Little Rock, where he died
August 4, 1874, at the age of seventy-
one years.
it was well-known throughout the
Northwest that Colonel Faulkner was
the original personator of the Arkansaw
Traveller it was his pride to be known
as such. The story, it is said, was
founded on a little incident which oc­
curred in the campaign of 1840, when
he made the tour of the State in com
pany with the lion. A. II. Sevier, Gov
ernor Fulton, Chester Ashley, and Gov­
ernor Yell. One day in the Boston
Mountain the party approached a squat­
ter's for information of the route, and
Colonel Sandy was made spokesman of
the company, and it wan upon his witty
responses the tune and story were
founded.
On returning to Little Rock, p grand
banquet was given in the famous ""bar­
room"" which used to stand near the
Anthonv House, and Colonel Sandy
was called upon to play the tune and
tell the story. Afterward it grew into
popularity. When he subsequently went
to New Orleans, the fame of the Arkan­
saw Traveller had gone ahead of him.
and at a banquet, ainid clinking glasses
and brilliant toasts, he was handed a
violin by the then Governor of Louisi­
ana, and requested to favor them with
his favorite Arkansas tune. At the old
St. Charlos Hotel a special room was
devoted to his use, bearing in gilt let­
ters over the door, ""Arkansaw Travel­
ler""The following is thebest-authenticated
account of the dialogue between
Faulkner, the ""Traveller,"" and the
squatter:
Traveller. Halloo, stranger.
Squatter. Hello yourself.
T. Can I get to stay all night with
you?
8. No, sir; you can't git to
T. Have you any spirits here?
S. Lots uv 'em; Sal seen one last
night by that ar ole holler gum, and it
nearly skeered her to death.
T. You mistake my meaning; have
you any liquor?
S. Had some yesterday, but Ole
Hose he got in and lapped all uvit out'n
the pot
T. You don't understand; I don't
mean pot liquor. I'm wot and cold,
and want some whisky. Have you got
anyr
S. O, yes I drunk the last this
mornin'.
T. I'm hungry; haven't had a thing
since morning; can't you give me some­
thing to eat?
S. Hain't a dumed thing in the
bouse. Not a moulTul uv meat, nor a
dust uv meal here.
.T. Well, can't you give my horse
something?
S. Got nothin' to feed him on.
T. How far is it to the next house?
S. Stranger, I don't know; I've never
been thar.
T. Well, do you know who lives
here?
S. Yes, sir.
T. As I am so bold, then, what might
your name be?
S. It might be Dick, and might be
Tom; but it lacks right smart uv it.
T. Sir! will you tell me where thi
road goes to?
S. It's never gone anywhar since
I've lived here. It's always thar when
I get up in the mornin'.
T. Well, bow far is it to where it
forks?
. S. It don't fork at all; but it splits
up like the devil.
T. As I'm not likely to gel to any
other house to-night, can't you let me
sleep in yours? And I'll tie my horse
to a tree and do without any thing to
eat or drink.
S. My house leaks. Thar's only one
dry spot in it, and me and Sal sleeps on
it. And that thar tree is the old wo­
man's, persimmon; you can't tie to it,
Vaze sh. don't want 'em shuk off. She
'lows to make beer out'n em. ....

T. Why don't- vou finish covering:

your house and stop the leaks?
o. it s been rainiu' an day.
T. Well, why doo't you do it in dry
weather? '
S. It don't leak, then.
T. As there seems to be nothing
alive about your place but children, how
do you do here, anyhow?
S. Putty well, I thank you. How di
you do yourself?
T. I mean, what do you do for a
living here?
S. Keep tavern, and sell whisky.
T. Well, I told you that I wanted
some whisky.
S. Stranger. I bought a bar'l mor'n
a week ago. You see, me and Sal­
went shars. Arter we got it here we
only had a bit betweenst us, and Sal she
didn't want to use-hern fust, nor me
mine. You see, I had a spiggin in one
end, and she in t'other. So she takes a
drink out'n niy end, and pays me the
bit for it; then I'd take one out'n hern,
and give her the bit. Well, we's get­
ting 'long fust-rate till Dick, durned
skulking skunk, he bor'n a hole on the
bottom to suck at, and the next time I
went to buy a drink there wan't none

gone, but, my friend, why don't you
play the balance of that tune?
S. It's got no balance to it.

Stranger, can you play the fiddul?
Yes; a little, sometimes.
You don't look liko a fiddlur, but
ef you think you can play any more on­
to that thar tune, you kin just try it.
(The traveller takes the fiddle and
plays the whole of it.)
S. Stranger, tuck half-a-dozen cheers
and sot down. Sal, stir Yourself round
like a six-horse team in a mud-hole. Go
round in the holler where I killed that
buck this mornin', cut off some of the
best pieces, and fetch it and cook it for
me and this gentleman d'rectly. Iiaiso
up the board under the head of the bed,
and get the old black jug I hid from
Dick, and gir, us some whisky. 1

climb up in the loft and git ""the rag

carry the gentleman's hoss round undet
the shed, and give him some fodder and
corn, much as he kin eat.
TiL Dad, they ain't knifes enufffor
to sot the table.
S. Whar's big butch, little butch,
old case, cob-handle, granny's knife,
and the one I handled yesterday' That's
enuff to sot any gentleman's table, out'n
you lost um. Durn me, stranger, cf
you can't stay as long as you please,
and I'll give you plenty to eat and

T. "" Yes, sir.

We don't have nothin' that way here
but grub Hyson, and I reckon it's
mighty good with sweetenin'. Play
away, stranger; you kin sleep on the
dry spot to-night.
T. (After about two hours' fiddling.)
My friend, can't you tell me about the
road I'm to travel to-morrow?
S, To-morrow! Stranger, you won't
Set out'n these diggins for six weeks,

have to git crost that; then you take the

you'll come to atwo-acre-and-a-half corn

but you needn't mind that; just ride on.
About a mile and a half or two miles
from there you'll come to the d dest

travels; it's boggy enuff to mire a sad-,

                 was ever scolded out of his sins. The heart, corrupt as it is, and because it is so, becomes angry if it be not treated with some management and good manners, and scolds again. A surlv mastiff -will bear perhaps to be stroked, though he will growl even under that operation; but if you touch him roughly he will bite. There is no grace that the spirit of self can counterfeit with more suc-
                 cess, than a religious zeal. A .nan thinks he. is fighting for Christ, and he is fighting for his own notions. He thinks he is skilfully searching the hb.arts of others, when he is only gratifying the malignity of his own; and charitably supposes his hearers destitute of all grace, that lie may shine the more in his own eyes by comparison. When he has performed this notable task, he wonders that they are not converted; ""he has given it them soundly, and if they do not tremble and confess that God is
                 in him of a truth, he gives them up as reprobate, incorrigible, and lost for ever."" But a man that loves me, if he sees me in an error, will pity me, and calmly endeavor to convince me of it and persuade me to forsake it. If he has great and good pews to tell -me, he will not do it angrily, and in much heat and discomposure of spirit. It is not therefore easy to conceive on what ground a minister can justify a conduct which only proves that he does not understand his errand. The absurdity of it would certainly strike him if he were not himself deluded.
                 A people will always love a minister if a minister seems to
                 love his people. The old maxim simile agit in simile, is in no case more exactly verified; there. fore you were beloved at Olney, and if you preached to the Chickesaws and Choctaws, would be equally beloved by them.

Paris In ono year preceded tho worst
revolution that Franco over saw. And
I tell you what you know as well as I
do, that wrong notions on tho subject
of Christian marrlago are the causo at
this day of moro moral outrage boforo
God and man than any other cause.
There aro somo things that I want to
bring before you. I know there aro
those of you who havo had homes sot
up for a great many years; and then
there arc those here who havo just es­
tablished their home. Thoy have only
been in that homo a fow months or it
few years. Then, there aro thoso who
will, after awhile, sot up for thorn­
soIvps a home, ond It is right that I
should speak out upon theso themes.
My first counsel to you Is, have God
in your now home, If it be a now
home: and let Him who was a guost nt

Bethany bo In your household; lot the
divine blesslntr drop upon your every
hope and plan ond expectation. Thoso
young people who begin with God ond
with Heaven. Havo on your right
hand the engagement ring of divine
affection. If one of you bo a Chris­
tian, let that one toko tho lllblo and
rend a few verses In tho evening time,
and then kneel down and commend
yoursolvcs to Him who settoth tho
solitary In families. I want to tell
you that tho destroying nngel posses
by without touching or entering the
door post sprinkled with blood of tho
everlasting covenant. Why is It that
In some families they never got) along,
and In others they always get along
well? I have watched such cases, and
have come to a conclusion. In tho
first Instance, nothing seemed to go
pleasantly, nnd after a while thoro
came a devastation, domestic disaster
or estrangement. Why? Thoy started
wronir. In tho other case, although
thoro were hardships and trials ond
somo things that had to bo explained,
still things went on pleasantly until
tho very last. Why? Thoy starteu
right. .
My second advice to you in your
home is to exorcise to tho very last
possibility of your naturo tho law of
forbearance. Prayers In tho house­
hold will not mako up for ovorything.
Some of tho best peoplo In the world
aro tho hardest to get along with.
There aro peoplo who stand up in
praycr-racotlngs nnd pray llko angels,
who at home aro uncompromising and
cranky. You may not havo every
thing just as you want it, sometimes
It will bo the duty of the husband and
sometimes of tho wife to ylold: but
both stand punctiliously on your
rights, and you will have a Waterloo
with no Ulucher coming up at night­
fall to decide tho conflict.
Never bo ashamed to apologize when
you have dono wrong lii domestic af
fairs. Lot that bo a law ol your House­
hold. Tho best thing I ever heard of
my grandfothor, whom I never saw,
was this: that once, having unright­
eously rebuked one ot his children, he
himself having lost his patience, and,
perhaps, having been misinformed of
the child's doings, found out his mis­
take, and In the evening of the samo
day gathered all his family together,
and said, ""Now, 1 havo one explana
tion to make, and one thing to say.
Thomas, this morning I rebuked you
very unfairly. I am very sorry for It.
I rebuked you In tho presence of the
whole family, and now I ask your for­
giveness In their presence."" It must
have taken somo courage to do that,
it was right, was It not? Never bo
ashamed to apologlre for domestic In­
accuracy. Find out the points; what
are tho weak points, If I may call
them so, of your companion, and then
stand aloof from them. Do not carry
tho fire of your temper too near tho
gunpowder. If the wlfo be easily
fretted by disorder In tho household,
let tho husband bo careful where ho
throws his sllppors. If tho husband
come homo from the store with his pa­
tience exhausted, do not let tho wife
unnecessarily cross his temper; but
both stand up for your rights, nnd I
will promise tho everlasting sound of
tho war-whoop. Your life will bo
spsnt In muklng up, and murrlage will
be to you an unmitigated curse.
I advise, also, that you make your
chief pleasure circle around about
that home. It Is unfortunato when It
Is otherwise. If tho husband spend
thu most of his nights awoy from
home, ot choice, and not of necessity,
ho Is not the head of tho household; ho
Is only the cashier. If tho wife thiow
tho cares of thu household Into thu
servant's lap, und then spend live
nights of tho week nt tho opera or
theater, she may clothe her children
with satins and laces and ribbons that
would confound a French milliner,
but thoy are orphans. It Is sad when
a child has no one to say its prayers to
because mothor has gone nlT to tho
evening entertainment! In India they
bring children and throw them to tho
crocodiles, and It scums very cruol;
but the jaws of social dissipation arc
swallowing down more little children
to-day than nil tho monsters that over
crawled upon tho banks of tho Ganges!

The Seven-Shilling Piece.
It was during the panic of 1820, that a
gentleman whom we shall call Mr. Thomp­
son, was seated, with something of a melan­
choly look, in his dreary back room, watch
ing lus clerks paying away thousands of
pounds hourly. Thompson was a banker of
excellent credit ; there existed perhaps in
the city of London no safer concern than
that of Messrs. Thompson &amp;. Co., but at a
moment, such as 1 speak oi', no rational re­
flection was admitted, no stability was look­
ed to; a general distrust was felt, and eve­
ry person rushed to his banker's to withdraw
his hoard, fearful that the next instant would
bo too late, forgetting entirely that this step
was that of all others the most likely to in­
sure the ruin ho sought to avoidt ,
But to return. Tho wealthy citizen sat
gloomily watching tho outpouring of his
gold, and with a grim smile listening to the
clamorous demands on his cashier; for al­
though he felt perfectly easy and secure as
to the ultimate strength of his. resources, yet
he could not repress a feeling of bitterness
as lie saw constituent utter constituent rush

in, and those whom he fondly imagined to
be his dearest friends eagerly assisting in the
run upon his strongbox.
Presently the door opened, and a stran­
ger was ushered in, who, after gazing for a

moment at the bewildered banker, coolly .
drow a chair, and abruptly addressed him :
"" You will pardon me, sir, for asking a .
strange question : but I am a plain man, and

agitated feelings overcame his usual

was the first to advance. Washington,
affected even to tears, grasped ' his

through a corps of light infantry and
proceeded on foot to Whitehall ferry.
Having entered the barge, he turned
to them, took off bis hat and waved! a

"387","42950142908","Luther, when studying, always had his dog lying at his feet-a  he had brought from Wartburg, and of which he was very fond. An ivory crucifix stood on the table before him, and the walls of his study were stuck round with caricatures of the Pope. He worked at his desk for days together without going out; but when fatigued, and the ideas began to stagnate in his brain, he would take his flute or his guitar with him into the porch, and there execute some musi- cal fantasy (for he was a skilful musician,) when the ideas would flow upon him as fresh as flowers after summer s rain. Music was his invariable solace at such times. Indeed, Luther did not hesitate to say, that after theology, music was the first of arts. ""1 Mu- sic,"" said he, ""is the art of the prophets; it
                 is the only other art, which, like theology, can calm the agitation of the soul, and put the devil to flight."" Next to music, if not before it, Luther loved children and flowers. That great, gnarled man had a heart as ten- der as a woman s.
                 Calvin studied in his bed. Every morn- ing, at five or six o clock, he had books, manuscripts and papers carried to him there, and he worked on for hours together. If he had occasion to go out, on his return he un- dressed and went to bed again to continue his studies. In his later years he dictated his writings to secretaries. He rarely cor- rected anything. The sentences issued com- plete from his mouth. If he felt his facility of composition leaving him, lie forthwith quitted his bed, gave up writing and com- posing, and went about his out-door duties for days, weeks, and months together. But so soon as he felt the inspiration fall upon him again, he went back to his bed, and his secretary set to work forthwith.
                 Cujas, another learned man, used to study when laid all his length upon the carpet, his face toward the floor, and there he revelled amidst piles of books which accumulated about him. The learned Amyot never stud- ied without the harpsichord beside him; and lie only quitted the pen to play it. Bentham, also, was extremely fond of the piano-forte, and had one in nearly every room in his house.
                 Richelieu amused himself in the intervals of his labor with a squadron of cats, of whom he was very fond. He used to go to bed at eleven at night, and after sleeping three hours, rise and write, dictate or work, till from six to eight o clock in the morning, when his daily levee was held. This worthy student displayed an extravagance equalling that of Wolsey. His annual expenditure was some four millions of francs, or about ?170,000 sterling.
                 How different the fastidious temperance of Milton! He drank water and lived on the humblest fare. In his youth, lie studied during the greatest part of the night; but in his more advanced years he went early to bed-by nine o clock-rising to his studies at four in summer and five in winter. He studied till mid-day; then he took an hour s exercise, and after dinner he sang and played the organ, or listened to others' music. He studied again till six, and from that hour till eight he engaged in conversation with friends who came to see him. Then lie supped, smoked a pipe of tobacco, drank a glass of water, and went to bed. Glorious visions
                 came to him in the night, for it was then, while lying on his couch, that he composed in thought the greater part of his sublime poem. Sometimes when the fit of composi- tion came strong upon him, he would call his daughter to his side, to commit to paper that which he bad composed.
                 Milton was of opinion that the verses composed by him between the autumnal and spring equinoxes were always the best, and he was never satisfied with the verses he had written at any other season. Alfieri, on the contrary, said that the equinoctial winds pro- duced a state of almost a complete stupidity"" in him. Like the nightingale, be could only  in summer. It was his favorite season.
                 Pierre Corneille, in his loftiest flights of imagination, was often brought to a stand still for want of words and rhyme. Thoughts were seething in his brain, which he vainly tried to reduce to order, and be would often run to his Thomas * for a word."" Thomas rarely failed him. Sometimes, in his fits of inspiration, he would bandage his eyes, throw himself on the sofa, and dictate to his wife, who almost worshipped his genius. Thus he would pass whole days, dictating to her his great tragedies; his wife scarcely ven- tured to speak, almost afraid to breathe. Afterwards, when a tragedy was finished, ho would call in his sister Martha, and submit it to her judgment; as Moliere used to con- sult his old housekeeper about the comedies he had newly written.
                 Racine composed his verses while walking about, reciting them in a loud voice. One day, when thus working at his play of Mith- , in the Tuileries Gardens, a crowd of workmen gathered around him, attracted by his gestures; they took him to be a madman about to throw himself into the basin. On his return home from such walks, he would write down scene by scene, at first in prose, and when he had thus written it out, he would exclaim-* My tragedy is done,"" con- sidering the dressing of the acts up in verse as a very small affair.

change for the vile stuff you sell across this

the mouths of the famishing wives and chil­
dren cf your customers? That it strips the

ther's hand, ""here's a gentleman who wants
me to sins; Little Be-sie for him. Shall I
J it ?"" ,
""res, darling, if they wish you to.""
They all joined in the request, and placing
her in a chair she sang, in a sweet childish
voice, the following Leautiful song :
' Out in the gloomy night sadly I roam ;
I have no mother dear, no plccsant home ;
Nobody cares for me, no one nould cry.
Even if poor Little Bessie should die.
Weary and tired I've been wand'rin-all day,
Asking for work, but I'm too small they say;
On the damp ground I mnst now lay my head.
Father's a drunkard, and mother ia dead,
We were so happy till Father drank ruin,
Then all our sorrow and trouble begun:
Mother crew pale and wept every dav
J ISsby and I were too hungry to piay.
. Slowlv they faded till one summer night
Found their dead faces all silent snd white ;
Then with big tears slowly dropping I said .
Father's a drunkard, and mother is dead.
""Oh. if tha temoeranee men only would find
Poor, wretched father and talk very kind ;
If they would stop him from drinking, why thee
i isVttoo iste'' temperance men please trT.

Or poor little Bessie must soon starve and die ;
All the day long I've been begging for bread.
Father's a drunkard and mother is dead.""
The scene I shall never forget to my dying
day, anl the swfet cadence of her musical
voice still rings in my ears, and every word
of the song, as.it dropped from her lips,
sunk deep into the hearts of those gathered
around her. With.her golden curls falling
carelessly around her little shoulders, her
face of almost ethereal beauty, and looRIng
so trustingly and confidently upon the men
around, her beautiful eyes lighted up with a
light that seemed not of this earth, formed
a picture worthy of the pen of a poet or
painter, although a statue of purity and in­
nocence. The unfinished games of billiards
were laid by, the cards thrown aside, (lie un­
emptied glass remained upon the counter""
and all pressed near, some with curiosity,
some with, sadness, and Foroe with pity
beaming from their eyes, entranced with the
masieal voice and beauty of a child who
sremed better fit to be with r.:gels above
than in such a place.
At the ciose of the song many wore weep­
ing men who had not shed a tear for years
now wept like a child. One young man who
had resisted with scorn the pleadings of a
loving mother and dear friends to lead abet­
ter life, to desist from a course that was
wasting his fortune and ruining his hetdth,
now approached the child, .a""d taking her
hands while tears streamed down his pale
cheeks, exclaimed with deep emotion :
""God bless you. my little angel, you have
saved me from ruin and disgrace from pov­
erty and a. drunkard's grave. If there ever
was an angel oti esrtit yrti are one. God
bless yoti, God bless you,"" and placing a bill
in the hand of the mother, sa'.d, ""please ac­
cept ttiis triue is a token of my regard and
esteem, for your little girl has done me a
kindness no wealth can ever r?pp.y. And
whenever you are in want yoti will ever find
me a true friend,"" at the same time giving
her his name and address. Taking her child
by the 1 and she turned to go, but pausing at
the door, said :
""God bicss you, gentlemen, and- please
accept the heartfelt thanks of a poor and
friendless woman for the kindness and cour­
tesy you have shown her,"" and before any
one could reply, she was gone.
A silence of several minutes ensued which
was at last broken by the proprietorexcla'in-
""Gentlemen, that lady is right; I have
sold my last glass of whisky, and if any ( f
you want any more you will have to go else­
where."" "".
""And I-hare drank my last glass of whis­
ky,"" st-id a yciing man who had long been
-iriveri np us utterly beyond tlie reach of those
who had a deep interest in liia ivc-llan- that
he had sunk too low to ever reform. ""There
is a temperance organisation in this city call­
ed the Temple of Honor, and at their, next
meeting I shall send in my name to be ad­
mitted. Who will go with me?""
""I 1"" ""I !"" and ""1 1"" several exclaimed
in chorus, and fifteen names were added to
his. True to his word, tlie owner of the
saloon where this strange scene was enacted
disposed of his entire stock the next day,
and is now engaged in an honorable business.

intoevery hamlet and town and city through­
out our country, and meet with the same
cheering result.

WHAT FASHION DOES.—Fashion
rules the world, and a most tyrannical
mistress she is—compelling people to
submit to the most inconvenient things
imaginable, for her sake. She pinches
feet with tight shoes, or chokes us with
tight neckerchiefs, or squeezes the
breath out of our bodies by tight lacing.
She makes people sit up by night,
when they ought to be in bed; and
keeps them in bed in the morning
when they ought to be up and doing.
She causes hosts of apparently sensi­
ble persons in other respects to pay
ex orbitant prices for the privilege of
seeing some foreign operatic or drama­
tic performers, puffed into notoriety by
hired nwspaper writers, and to call the
exhibition ""splendid,"" when they don't
understand a word that is said, or enjoy
the thing as well as an ordinary min­
strel show.

She makes it vulgar to wait upon
one's self, and genteel to live idle and
useless.

She requires people to visit when
they had rather stay at home, eat when
they are not hungry, and drink when
they are not thirsty.
She invades our pleasure and inter­
rupts our business.

She compels people to dress gaily,
whether upon their own property or
that of another, whether agreeable to
the word of God or the dictates of
pride.
She ruins health, and produces sick­
ness ; destroys life, and occasions prem­
ature death.

She makes tools of parents, invalids
of children, and servants of all.
She is a despot of the highest grade,
full of intrigue and cunning, and yet
husbands, wives, fathers, mothers,
sons, daughters and servants, black and
white, have voluntarily become her
obedient subjects and slaves, and vie
with one another to see who shall be
most ob3equious.

more than thirty years ago-that is, all of d
them except one; but then that one was o

his peculiarities had been to be an old sub­

paid such small attention to their chaffing :
that they had come to find it little pleasure, tj
and after some weeks of discomfort, Lieut.
Jones had been allowed to'choose his own j
pleasures without much interference.
These were not extravagant-a favorite n

r Drawing continually on the men for c

C tcuing cheers--he met wave after wave in
. the same manner, diving under them like
an otter and getting nearer to the wreck B
bivith every wave, really advancing, how­ -q
'ever, more below the water than above it. Bu
Suddenly the desparing men on board I
heard a clear, hopeful voice :
.""Help at hand, Captain! Throw me a -
i bony.""
1' And in anotber minute or two Jones was
a on the deck, and the cheers from: the little
e steamer. were echoed by the cheers ;of the S7
crowd on the land. There was not a mo­
ment to be lost; she was breaking up fast;
o but it took but a few minutes to fasten a
a strong dable to the small rope and draw it
on board, and then a second cable, and the
-
n communication was complete.
e ""There is a lady here, sir,"" said the
o Captain. ""We must rig up a chair for
her, she can never walk' that dangerous
grope.""
e But we have not a moment .to waste, or in
e we may allbe lost; iS she very heavy?""'
i ""A slight little thing-half a child, sir."" se
""Bring her here.
:
t This was no time for ceremony. With­
e out a word, save a few sentences of direc­
e tion and encouragement, he took 'her under
e his 'left arm, and steadying hiniself with
the upper-cable walked on the lower-with
e his burden safely to the hbore. The crew :IL
k rapidly followed, for in such moments of
extremity the soul masters the body, and On
all th:ngs become possible. There was
p, lenty of help waiting for the seamen, and -
d the lady, her father and the captain had I
d been put in the carriage of Braddon and
d driven rapidly to the hospital hall.
e Jones, amid the confusion, disappeared.
He had picked up an oil-skin coat, and
when every one turned to thank their de­
i, liverer he was gone. No one knew him; x
e the sailors said they believed him to be
""one of the military guests by his rigging,"" at
but the individuality of the hero troubled
no one until the danger was over. In an
hour the steamer was­ driven on the rocks g'
and went to pieces, and it being by this It
- time quite dark, every one went home.
t The next day the hunting party reurned
. from Gwynne Hall, the storm having com­
pelled them to stop all night, and at the -
Sdinner that evening the wreck and the hero
s of it were the theme of every one's conver­
n sation.
b' ""S'uch a plucky fellow,"" said Ensign I
d Powell. ""I wonder who he was. Gwynne
ig says he was a. stranger; perhaps one of
e, that crowd staying at the Day,""
t ""Perhaps,"" said Capt. Marks, ""it was
n Jones."" ""
e. ""Oh, Jones would be too afraid of his
Le mother.""
Ir Jones made a little bow, and said pleas­
e. antly, ""Perhaps it was Powell,"" at which
is Powell laughed, and said, ''Not if he knew
it it."" C
In a week the event had pretty well ex­
hausted, especially as there.was to be a
great dinner and ball at. Braddon, and all
ie the officers had invitation. The ball had a
i peculiar interest, tor the young lady who
le had been saved from the wreck would be
d present and rumors of her riches and beau­
' ty had been rife-for .several days,. It .was
e­ said the little steamer was ner father's prl­
vate yatch, and that he was a man of rank
San'dinfluence.
.. Jones said he would not go to the dinner
as either, he or Saville must remain for eve­
ning drill, and that Saville loved a good
dinner; while he cared very little about it.
as Saville could return in time to let him ride
over about ten o'clock.and see the dancing,
ie­ Saville rather wondered why Jones did not
nd take his place all the evening, and felt half
nd injured at this default.. But Jones had a
1 curiosity about the girl he had saved. To
tell the truth, he was nearerin love with
lika than he had ever been with any woman,
and he' wished, in 'calm blood, to see if

                 If in conversation you think a person wrong-rather hint a difference of opinion than ofler a contradiction.
                 If you find a person telling an absolute ilasehood- let it pass over in silence; it is not worth your while to make any one your enemy, by proving him a liar.
                 It is always in your power to make a friend by smiles-what a folly to make enemies by frowns!
                 When you have an opportunity to praise-do it with all your heart.
                 When you are forced to blame-appear, at least, to do it with reluctance.
                 If you are envious of another woman-never show it but by allowing her every good quality and perfec. tion except those she really possesses.
                 If you wish to let the world know you are in love with a particular man-treat him with formality, and every one else with ease and freedom.
                 If you are disposed to be pettish or insolent-it is better to exercise your ill humor on your dog, your cat, or your servant, than your friends.
                 If you would preserve beauty-rise early. If you would preserve esteem-be gentle.
                 If you would obtain power-be condescending.
                 It you would live happy-endeavor to promote the happiness of others.

I married the &amp;nbsp; widow, and then my giddy old father came along, met our stepdaughter, and married her straight away. That made my wife the mother-in-law of her father-in-law, and made my step-daughter my mother, and my father became my step-son. Do you follow the tangled thread of our discourse ? Very well, but bear with me a little and I'll tangle it much worse."" "" My step-mother:—that is to say, my wife's step-daughter, and the wife of my father, who was also my step-son, gave birth to a boy, Now, you can see at a glance that that blessed boy was my brother, because he was my father's son, but was also the son of my wife's step-daughter, and there-fore her grandson. That made my grand father to my step-brother. All right—sit still, and I'll compli-cate those matrimonial matters some more. In the fulness of time, or perhaps a little sooner, my wife had a son, and then my brain-pan began to spin round in real earnest, for my mother-in-law, that is the step-sister to my son, was also his grandmother, because he was her step-son's child. My father is therefore the brother-in-law of my child, because his step-sister is his wife. And now you will aak, where do I come in ? I enter on the scene in this wise: I am the brother of my own son, who is also the child of my step-grandmother.
