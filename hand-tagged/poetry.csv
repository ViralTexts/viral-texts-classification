WHY NHOII.D ANY MAN SWEAU.
We can conceive of no reason why
he should, but often reason why he
should not.
It is mean. A man of high moral
standing would almost as soon steal a
sheep as to swear.
It is vulgar. Although too mean for
a decent man.
It is cowardly. Implying a fear
either of not being believed or obeyed.
It is ungentlemanly. A gentleman,
according to Webster, is a genteel man
well bred, refined. Such a one will no
more swear than go into the street to
throw mud with a clodhopper.
It is indecent. Offensive to delicacy
and extremely unfit for human ears.
It is foolish. Want of decency is
want of good common sense.
It is abusive. To the mind which
conceives the oath, to the tongue which
Otters it, and to the person at whom it
is aimed.
It is venomous. Showing a man's
heart to be the nest of vipers, and eve­
ry time he swears one of them sticks
out its head.
It is contemptible. Forfeiting the
respect of the wise and the good.
It is wicked. Violating the Divine
law, and provoking the displeasures of
Him who will not hold him guiltless
who takes His name in vain.
It is cheap. A inau derives less
pleasure and comfort from this habit
than from any sin he may commit
Then, it is cheap, for he gets no pay,
except the wages of sin, which is death
Every objection urged is well taken;
yet we find so many of our leading

It does them no good, and they admit,

AN OLD MAN'S STORY,
A THRILLING SKETCH.
I shall never forget the commencement A'
of the temperance reformation. I wan a ed
child at the time, of some ton years of ago. pi
Our homo had every comfort, and my pa­ sai
rents idolized me, their only child. Wino th
was often at the table, and my father and
mother frequently gave it to me at the bot. fai
tom of the morning glass. an
One Sunday at churoh, a startling an­ to
nouncement was made to the people. I dr
knew nothing of its purport, but there was mi
much whispering among the men. The pas.
tor said that on the next evening thern he
would be a meeting and an address upon the to
evils of intemporence in the use ofilcoholie ge
drinks. IIo expressed himself ignorant of on
the object of the meeting, and could not eay m
what courae it would be best to pursue in as
the matter. lo
The subject of the meeting eamoe up at our of
table after the service, and I questioned Iny th
father about it with all the curious eager­ wi
ness of a child. The whispers and words he
which were dropped in my hearing, clothed th
the affair with a great mystery to me, and I ye
was all eagerness to learn theoetrange thing. a
My father said it was merely some scheme he
to unite church and state. wl
The night came, and groups of people
gathered on the tavern steps, and I saw m
drunken men come reeling out of the bar­ to
room. I urged my father to lot me go, but sl
he at first refused. Finally, thinking it to
would be no innocent gratifcation of mycu­ ul
riosity, he put on his hat, and we passed a. he
cross the green to the church. I remember fa
well how the people appeared as they came pr
io, seeming to wonder what kind of an ox­ bh
0
bition was to come off. re
r
In the corner was the tavern keeper and hi
around him a number of friends. For no m
d
hour the people of the place continued to th
come in, until there was a fair house full.­
All were curiously watching the door, won­ fa
deriug what would appear next. The pas­ at
tor stole in and took his seat behind the ci
a gallery, as if doubtful of the propriety of
his being in the church at all. tt
Two men finally came in and went to the fe
it alter and took their seats. All eyes were bi
fixed upon them, and angneral stillness pro­ o1
veiled throughout the house. w
The men were unlike in appearance, one
being short, thick sot in build; thoother tall a,
and well formed. The youngerbad the man­ a
ner and dress of a clergyman, a full, round w
face, and a quiet, good natured look, as he
leisurely look around the audience. at
But my childish interest was all in the old ec
man. His broad, deep chest, and unusual y
height, looked giant like as he strode up the
aisle. His hair was white, his brow deeply
to
seamed with furrows; and around hisbhand­ t,
some mouth, lines of calm and touching sad­ r,
ness. His oyclblack and restless, and kin­ ti
a died as the tavern keeper uttered a low ,est i,
aloud. Hi libs were compressed, and a f
, crimson flush came and went over his pale t
check. One arm was off at the elbow, and f
there was a scar over the right eye.
The younger finally arose ahd stated the
1C object of the meeting, and asked ifthere was d
a clergyman present to open with prayer.
h Our pastor kept his seat, and the speaker f
to himself mad a short prayer, and than made t
a short address at the conclusion calling up­ a
on any one present to make remarks The
pastor arose in the gallery, and attacked the ing
position of the speaker, using the arguments ma
which I have often heard since, and conclu­ fie
dod by denouncing those engaged in the new up
movement as meddlesome fanatics who in
wished to break up the time honored usages fel
of good society, and injure the business of str

remarks, the tavern keeper and his friends we
got up a cheer, and the current of fooeeling cle

lost in thought and then in a low and trem­ do
ulous tone commenced. There was a depth soe
in that voicet a thrilling pathos and sweet­
ness which revited every heart in the house hii
before the first-period had been rounded.­ fe.
My father's attention had become fixed on a,
the eye of the speaker with an interest I had frc
m neover before seen him exhibit. I can hut co
briefly remember the substance of what the atc
old man said, though the scene is ns vivid, to

a : 'My friends I Iam astranger in your vil­ ha

It is strange what power there is In some an
voices. The speaker's voice was low and so
rnensured, but a tear trembled in every eye, th
and before I know why, a tear dropped upon an
my hand, followed by others like rain drops. he
The old man brushed one from his eyes and an
continued: :m

when we drove in a gorgeous sleigh to the
Winter Palace-which was llke a fairy pict­

within with the brilliancy of thousands of
candles-to attend a court reception. The
effect of the light on the snow and upon the
gay equipages of the numerous guests was,
indescribable. We approached the Empress
through 3,000 officials, First through superb
State Departmlients, each blazing with a
thousand. wax tapers and. gnrgeous with
priceless hangings, malachite pillars, works

opportunity to see, and I made much of it.
At last we entered the throne-oom, and
there, surrounded by a sea of splendor,
Sstood the Empress, herself a moving mass
of diaminds. She was the most dazzling
sight of all, On her head was a crown once
wort by the Great Elizabeth. It Was the

I had seen a real crown on royalty,
for the diamond tiara worn by Queen Vic.

crown, except in name. Mrs. Astor used to

"210","677052","Rev. Frederick Brooks of Cleveland, O. the popular editor of the Standard of the Cross, who was so suddenly called from this world a few days since,
      selected the following poem for his paper this week, which appears in the last number.]
                 Like a blind spinner in the sun,
                 I tread my days;
                 I know that all the threads will run
                 Appointed ways.;
                 I know each day will bring its task, And, being blind, no more I ask. I do not know the use or name
                 Of that I spin ;
                 I only Lnow that some one came,
                 And laid within
                 My hand the thread and said "" Since you Are blind, but one thing you can do.""
                 Sometimes the threads so rough and fast
                 And tangled fly,
                 I know wild storms are sweeping past,
                 And fear that I
                 Shall fall; but dare not try to find A safer place, since I am blind. I know not why, but I am sure
                 That tint and place,
                 In some great fabric to endure
                 Past time and race,
                 My threads will have; so from the first Though blind, I never felt accursed.
                 I think, perhaps, this trust has sprung
                 From one short word
                 Said over me when I was young,So
                 young, I heard
                 It, knowing not that God's name signed
                 My brow, and sealed me His, though . But whether this be seat or sign
                 Within, without,
                 It matters not. The bond divine
                 I never doubt.
                 I know He set me here, and still,
                 And glad, and blind, I wait His will; But listen, listen, day by day,
                 To hear their tread

What matter how the north wind

O time and change! with hair as grey
As was my sire s that wintry day,
How strange it seems, with so much
gone
Of life and love, to still live on!
Ah, brother! only I and thou
Are left of that circle now.
The dear home faces whereupon
That fitful firelight paled and shone,
Henceforward, listen as we will,
The voices of that hearth are still;
Look where we may, the wide earth
o'er.
Those lighted laces smile no more.
We tread the paths their feet have
worn,
We sit beneath their orchard trees.
We hear, like them, the hum of bees
And rustle of the bladed coru.

We turn the pages that they read

Their Written words we linger o'er.
But in the eun they cast no shade,
No voice is heard, no sign is made,
No step la on the conscious floor!
Yet love will dream, and faith will
trust.
(Since He who knows our need is Just),
That somehow, somewhere, meet we
must. '
Alas for him who never sees
The stars shine through his cypress
trees!
Who, hopeless, lays his dead away,
Nor looks to see the breaking day
Across the mournful marbles play!
Who hath not learned, in hours of faith
The truth to flesh and sense unknown,
That life is ever lord of death,
And love can never lose Its own.

"298","963712","Out yonder is a mau very old at forty
years of age, at a time when he ought to
be bouyant as the morning. He got bad
habits on him very early, and those habits
have become worse. He is a man on
fire, on fire with alcoholism, on fire
with all evil habits, out with the world
and the world out with him. Down and
falling de?per. His swollen hands in his
threadbare pockets and his eyes fixed on
the ground, he passes through the street,
and the quick step of an innocent child or
the strong step of a young man or the roll of
a prosperous carriage maddens him, and he
curses society and he curses God. Fallen
sick, with no resources, he is carried to the
almshouse. A loathsome spectacle, he lies
all day long waiting for dissolution, or in the
night rises on his cot and fights apparitions
of what he might have been and of what he
will be. He started life with as good a
prospect as any man on the Ameri­
can continent, but there he is a bloated car­
cass waiting for the shovels of public charity
to put him five feet under. He has only
reaped what he sowed. Harvest of wild
oats ! ''There is a way that seemeth right to
a man, but the end thereof is death."" Young
man, as you cannot live life over again how­
ever you may long to do so, be sure to have
your one life right. There is in this august
assembly I wot not, for we are made up
of all sections of this land and from many
lands, some young man who has gone away
from home and perhaps under some little
spite or evil persuasion of another, and his
parents know not where he is. My son, go
home ! Do not go to sea! Don't go to-night
where you may be tempted to go. Go home 1
Your father will be glad to see you and your
mother. I need not tell you how she feels.
How I would like to make your parents a
present of their wayward boy, repent­
ant and in his right mind. I would
like to write them a letter and you to carry
the letter, saying: ""By the blessing of God
on my sermon I introduce to you one whom
you have never seen before, for he has be­
come a new creature in Christ Jesus."" My
boy. go home and put your tired head on the
bosom that nursed you so tenderly in your
childhood years. A young Scotchman
was in battle taken captive by a
band of Indians, and he learned their
language and adopted their habits.
Years passed on, but the old Indian
chieftain never forgot that ha had in his pos­
session a young man who did not belong to
him. Well, one day this tribe of Indians
came in sight of the"" Scotch regiments from

wbom this young man had been captured,
ad the old Indian chieftain said: ""I lost
mv son in battle and I know bow a father
feels at the loss of a son. Do you think your
father is yet alive?"" The voung man said: ""I
am the only son of my father, and I
hope he is still alive."" Then said the
Indian chieftain : ""Because of the loss of my
son this world is a desert. You go free.
Return to your countrymen. Revisit your
father, that he may rejoice when he sees the
sun rise in the morning and the trees blos­
som in the spring."" So I say to you, young
man, captive of waywardness and sin : Your
father is waiting for you. Your mother is
waiting for you. Your sisters are waiting
for you. God is waiting for you. Go borne!

The little, innocent face looks so sublimely simple and confiding amongst the cold terrors of death. Crimeless and fearless, that little mortal has passed alone under the shadow, and explored the mystery of dissolution. There is death In Its sublimest and purest image; no hatred, no hypocrisy, no suspicion, no care for the morrow ever darkened that little face; death has come lovingly upon it; there is nothing cruel or harsh in its victory. The yearnings of love, Indeed, cannot be stifled; for the prattle, and smile, all the little world of thoughts that were so delightful, are gone forever. Awe, too, will overcast us In its presence, for we are looking on death; but we do not fear for the lonely voyager; for the child has gone, simple and trusting, into the presence of its all-wise Father; and of such, we know, is the kingdom of heaven.""

Crossing the Alps hy the Mount Oenis
pass or through the Mount Cenis tun­
nel, 3'ou are iu u few hours ret down t
Verona, Italy, and in a few minutes be­
jgin examining one of the grandest ruins
lof the world the amphitheater. The
whole building sweeps around you in a
circle. You stand in the arena where
the combat was once fought or the raco
run. and on all sides the seats rise, tier
above tier, until you count forty eleva­
tions or galleries, as I shall see fit to
call them, in which sat the senators,
the kings and the twenty-five thousand
excited spectators.
At the sides of the arena and under
jthe"" galleries are the cages in which tli i
lions and tigers are kept without focd
(until, frenzied with hunger and thirst.
they are let out upon some victim who,
(with his sword and alone, is condemned
tto meet them. I think that Paul hi::i-
jself once stood in such a place, and that
,it was not enly figuratively but literal­
ly that ho had ""fought with beasts at
tEphesus.""
j The gala day has come. From all the
(world the people arc pouring into Ve­
rona. Men, women and children, ora­
tors and senators, great men and small,
thousands upon thousands, come, until
the first gallery is full, and the second,
the third, the fourth, the fifth all the
way up to the twentieth, all the way
up to the thirtieth, all the way up to
the fortieth. Every place is filled.
.Immensity of audience sweeping the
'great circle. Silence! The time for
the contest has come. A Roman official
leads forth tho victim into the arena.
:Let him get his sword with firm grip
into his right hand. The twenty-five
thousand sit breathlessly watching. 1
hear the door at the side of the arena
'creak open. Out plunges the half starved
,lion, his tongue athirst for blood, and
with a roar that brings all the galleries?
to their feet he rushes against the sword
;of the combatant.
Do you know how strong a stroke a
:man will strike when his life defends
lupoii the first thrust of his blade? The
jwild beast, lame and bleeding, slinks
,back toward the side -of the arena; then,
Vallying his wasted strength, he comer­
tip with fiercer eye .and more terrible
iroar than ever, only to be driven back
rwith a fatal wound, while the combat­
'ant comes in with stroke after stroke,
until the monster is dead at his feet, czhI
the twenty-five thousand people clap
their hands and utter .a-shout that makes
the city tremble.
THERE ARE IJUXS IX THE WAY.
Sometimes the audience -came to see a
race: sometimes to ee gladiators fight
each other, until the people, conipas;- inn­
ate for the fallen, turned .their thumb.-;
down as an appeal that .the van qui shed
be spared, and sometimes ;the combat
was with wild beasts,
i To one of the Roman amphitheatrical
audiences cf one hundred thousand peo­
ple Paul refers when he says, ""We are
compassed about with so great a crowd
tf witnesses."" The -direct reference in
the last passage is made to a race, but
'elsewhere having discussed that, I take
now Paul's favorite idea of the Christian
life as a combat.
! The fact is that every Christian .man
:has a lion to fight. Yours is a bad cteui­
'""per. The gates of the arena have been
(opened and this tiger has come out to
'destroy j'our soul. It has lacerated you
jwith many a wound. You have bee,
thrown by it time and again, but in the
strength of God you have arisen to drive
it back. I verily believe you will con­
quer. I think that the temptation isget­
ting weaker and weaker. You have
given it so many wounds .that tho pra­
Sspect is that it will die and you shall he
jvictor, through Christ. Courage, broth­
er! Do not let the sands vof the arena
idrink the blood of j-our soul:
j Your lion is the passion for strong
idrink. You may have contended against
it twenty j-ears, but it is strong of body
iand thirsty of tongue. You have tried
!to fight it back with broken bottle or
empty wine fiesk. Nay! that is not the
weapon. With one horrible roar he will
tseize thee by the throat and iiend thee
llianb from limb. Take this weapon,
(sharp and keen reach up and get il
from God's armory the sword of the
Spirit. With that thou mayest drive
liiin back and conquer!
But why specify, when ever"" man and
woman has a lion to fight. If there b-s
lone here who has no besetting sin, lei
Ihiin speak out; for him have I offended,
If you have not fought the lion, it is be­
cause you have let.the lion eat you up
This very moment the contest goes on.
The Trojan celebration, where ten thou
sand gladiators fought and eleven thou-
nd wild beasts were slain, was not bo
errific a struggle as that which at this
oment goes on in many a soul. The
Jcombat was for the life of the body;
this is for the life of the soul. That wa?
with wild bestQ from the jungle; tbi;
is with the rcarifyp lion of hell.
TEE IXTIX1TE HELPER.
Men think when ttiey contend ngninH
n evil habit that they have to fight i'
3dl alone. No! They stand in the ccj
tcr of ar. immense circle of synrp 'hy

Paul had lieeu reciting thy names of
Abel, Enoch. Noah, Abraham, Sarah,
Isaac, Joseph, Gideon and Barak, and
then says, Being compassed about with
bo great a cloud of witnesses.""
Before I get through I will show you
that you fight in an arena around which
circle, in galleries above each other, all
the kindling eyes and all the sympa­
thetic hearts of tho ages; and at every
victory gained there comes down the
thundering applause of a great multi­
tude that no man can number. ""Being
compassed about with so great a cloud
of witnesses.""
On the first elevation of the ancient
amphitheater, on the day of a celebra­
tion, sat Tiberius or Augustus, or the
reigning king. So, in the great arena
of spectators that watch our struggles,
and in the first divine gallery, as I shall
call it, sits our King, one Jesus. On his
head are many crowns! The Roman
emperor got his place by cold blooded
conquests; but our King hath come to
his place by the broken hearts healed,
and the tears wiped away, and the souls
redeemed. The Homan emperor sat
with folded arms indifferent as to
whether the swordsman or the lion beat;
but our King's sympathies are all with
us. Nay, unheard of condescension! I
eec him come down from the gallery
into the arena to help us in the fight,
ch outing until all up and down his voice
is heard: ""'Fear not! I will help thee!
I will strengthen thee by the right hand
of my power!""
They gave to the men in the arena in,
the olden time food to thicken their
blood, so that it would flow slowly, and
that for a longer time the people might
gloat over the scene. But our King has
no pleasure in our wounds, for we are
bone of his bone, fiesh of his flesh, blood
cf his blood.
In all the anguish of our heart
The raan of sorrows boro a part.
Once, in the ancient amphitheater, a
lion with one paw caught the combat­
ant's sword and with his other paw
caught hi shield. The man took his
knife from his girdle and slew the beast.
Tlie king, sitting in the gallery, said,
""That was not fair; tho lion must be
slain bT a swovd."" Other lions were
turned out ;md the poor victim fell.
Yon cry, ""Shame! shame!"" at such
meanness. But the king in this case is
our brother, and he will see that we
have fair play. He will forbid the rush­
ing out cf more lions than we can meet.
He will not stiff er us to be tempted above
that we ai;o able. Thank God! The
King is in the gallery ! His eyes are on
us. His heart is with us. His hand
will deliver us. ""Blessed are all they
who put their trust in him.""
THE CELESTIAL. GUARDIANS.
I look again and I see the angelic
gallery. There they are; the angel that
swung the sword at the gate of Eden,
the same that Ezekiel saw upholding
the throne of God, and from which 1
look away, for the splendor is insuffer­
able. Here are the guardian angels.
That one watched a patriarch; this one
protected a child. That one has been
pulling a soul out of temptation! All
these are messengers of, light! Those
drove tho Spanish Armada on the rocks.
This turned Sennacherib's living hosts
into a heap of one hundred and fighty­
five thousand corpses. Those yonder
chanted the Christmas carol over Beth­
lehem until the chant awoke the shep­
herds. Theee, at creation, stood in th;
balcony of heaven and serenaded the;
newborn world wrapped in swaddling
clothes of light. And there, holier ar.tl
mightier than i:ll, is Michael, tho arch­
angel. To command an earthly host
gives dignity, but this one is leader of
the twenty ikcr.and chariots of God,
and of thrv ton thousand times ten thou­
sand j'.ng!: I think Gcd gives com­
mand to archangel, and tho arch­
angel to i'lii s';:-:iphim, and the seraphim
t' the cherubim, until all the lov. or
oi"".c:"":j cf Leaven hear the command
and go forth on tho high behest.
Nov, bring on your lions! Who can
fear? All tho spectators in the angelic
gallery are our fi-iends. ""He Bhall give
his angels charge over thee, to keep the
in all thy ways. They shall bear thee
up in their hands lest thou dash thy
foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread
upon the lion and adder; the young lion
and the dragon shalt thou trample un­
der foot.""
Though the arena be crowded with
temptations we shall, with the angelic
help, strike them down in the name of
our God aiid leap on their fallen car­
casses! O bending throng of bright an­
gelic faces and swift wings and lightning
foot! I hail you today from the dust
and struggle of the arena!
I look again .and see the gallery of
the prophets and apostles. Who are
those mighty ones up yonder? Hosea
end Jeremiah and Daniel and Isaiah
raid Paul and Peter and John and
James. There sits Noah, waiting for
all the world to come into the ark; and
'loses, waiting till the last Red sea shall
divide; and Jeremiah, waiting for the
Jews to return; and John, of the Apoc­
alypse, waiting for the swearing of the
angel that Time shall be no longer.
Glorious spirits! Ye were howled at.
ye were stoned; ye were spit upon!
They have been in this fight themselves,
and they are all with us. Daniel knows
all about lions. Paul fought with beasts
at Ephesus.
THE INTERESTED WITNESSES.
In tlie ancient amphitheater the peo­
ple got eo excited that they would shout
from the galleries to the men in thi
arena: ""At it again!"" ""Forward!"" ""One
more stroke!"" ""Look out!"" ""Fall
back!"" ""Huzza! Huzza!"" So in that
pallerj-, prophetic and apostolic, thej
cannot ksep their peace. Daniel crie:j.
out, ""Thy God will deliver thee from
the month of the lions!"" David ex­
claims, ""He will not suffer thy foot to
be moved!"" Isaiah calls out: ""Fear not!
I am with thee! Be not dismayed!""
Paul exclaims, ""Victory through oux
Lord Jesus Christ!"" That throng of
prophets and apostles cannot keep still.
They make the welkin ring with shout­
ing and halleluiahs.
I look again and I see the gallery of
the martyrs. Who is that? Hugh Lati­
mer, sure enough! He would not apolo­
gize for the truth preached, and so he

died the night before swinging from the
bedpost in perfect glee at the thought of
emancipation. Who are that army of
Eix thousand six hundred and sixty-six?
They are the The ban legion who died
for the faith. Here is a larger host in
magnificent array eight hundred and
eighty-four thousand who perished for
Christ in the persecutions of Diocletian.
Yonder is a family group, Felicitas, of
Rome, and her children. While they
were dying for the faith she stood en­
couraging them. One son was whipped
to death by thorns, another was flung
from a rock, another was beheaded. At
last the mother became a martyr. There
they are together a family group in
heaven. Yonder is John Bradford, who
said in the fire, ""We shall have a merry
supper .-kh the Lord tonight!"" Yonder
is Henry Vces, who exclaimed as he
died, ""If I had ten heads they should all
fall oif for Christ!""
The great throng of the martyrs!
They had hot lead poured down their
throats; horses were fastened to their
hands, and other horses to their feet,
and thus ihey were pulled apart; they
had their tongues pulled out by red hot
pincers; they were sewed up in the skins
of animals and then thrown to the dogs;
they were daubed with combustibles
and then ret on fire! If all the martyrs""
stakes that have been kindled could be
set at proper distances they would make
the midnight all tho world over bright
as noonday! .
And now they sit yonder in the mar­
tyrs' gallery. For them the fires of per­
secution have gone out. The swords
are sheathed and tlie mob hushed. Now
they watch us with an all observing
sympathy. They know all the pain, all
the hardship, all the anguish, all the in­
justice, all the privation. They cannot
keep still. They cry: ""Courage! The
fire will not consume. The floods can­
not drown. The lions cannot devour!
Courage! down there in the arena.""
What, are they all looking? This
night we answer back the salutation
they give, and cry, ""Hail! sons and
daughters of the fire !""
ALL, BRETHREN IN CHRIST.
I look again and see another gallerj-.
that of eminent Christians. What strikes
me strangely is the mixing in com­
panionship of those who on earth could
not agree. There is Albert Barnes, and
around him the presbytery who tried
him for heterodoxy! Yonder is Lyman
Beecher and the church court that de­
nounced him! Stranger than all, there
is John Calvin and James Arminius!
Who would have thought that they
would sit eo lovingly together? There is
George Whitefield and the ministers
who would not let him come into their
pulpits because they thought him a fa­
natic. There are the sweet singers Top­
lady, Montdmery, Charles Wesley,
Isaac Watts and Mrs. Sigourney. If
heaven had had no music before they
went up, they would have started the
singing.
And there the band of missionaries
David Abeel, talking of China redeemed;
and John Scudder, cf India saved; and
David Brainard, of the aborigines evan­
gelized; and Mrs. Adoniram s Jvjdson,
whose praters for Burmah took heaven
by violence! All these Christians are
looking into the arena. Our struggle io
nothing to theirs! Do we, in Christ's
cause, suffer from tho cold? They
walked Greenland's icy mountains. Do
we suffer from the heat? They swel­
tered in the tropics. Do we get fatigued?
They fainted, with none to care for
them but cannibals. Are we xiersG
cuted? They were anathematized. And
as the- look from their gallery and see
us falter iu tho presence of the lions, I
seem to heur Isaa.s Watts addressing
us in his old hymn, only a little changed:
SItist you be carried to t ao skie3
On ilewery beds of cast,
While others fought to v. ia tho prize
Or sailed through bloody eeas?
Toplady shouts in his old hymn:
Your harps, ye trembling saints,
Down from the willows take; ,
Loud to the praise of love divine.
Bid every string awake.
' W hilo Charles Wesley, the Methodist,
breaks forth in his favorite words, a lit­
tle varied:
A charge to keep you have,
A God to glorify;
A never dying soul tr save.
And fit it for the sky!
OUR DEPARTED FRIENDS. .
I look again and I see tho gallery of
our departed. Many of those in the
other galleries we have heard of, but
these we knew. Oh, how familiar their
faces! They sat at our tables, and wt
walked to the house of God in company.
Have they forgotten us? Those fathers
and mothers started us on the road of
life. Are they careless as to what be­
comes of us? And those children do
they look on with stolid indifference as
to whether we win or lose this battle for
eternity? Nay; I see that child running
its hand over your brow and saying,
""Father, do not fret."" ""Mother, do not
worry.""
They remember the day they left us.
They remember the agony of the lasi
farewell. Though years in heaven they
know our faces. They ' remember our
sorrows. They speak our names. The3
watch this fight for heaven. Nay, I see
them rise up and lean over and ,wave
before us their recognition and encour­
agement. That gallery is not full. They
are keeping places for us. After we have
slain the lion they expect the King to
call us, Baying, ""Come up higher!"" Be­
tween the hot struggles in the arena I
wipe the sweat from my brow andfetand
on tiptoe, reaching up my right hand to
clasp theirs in rapturous handshaking,
while their voices come ringing down
from the gallery, crying, ""Be ! thou
faithful unto death, and you shall have
is, crown!"" I

But here I pause, overwhelmed with
the majesty and the joy of the scene!
Gallery of the King! Gallery of angels!
Gallery of prophets and apostles! Gal­
lery of martyrs! Gallery of saints! Gal­
lery of friends and kindred I Oh, ma­
jestic circles of light and love! Throngs!
Throngs! Throngs! How shall we
stand the gaze of the universe ! Myriads
of ejes beaming on us! Myriads of
hearts beating in sympathy for us! How
shall we ever dare to sin again! How
shall we ever become discouraged again!
Hq stall we ever feel lonely, again!

With God for us, and angels for us,
and prophets and"" apostles for us, and tho
great souls of the ages for us, and our
glorified kindred for us shall we give
up the fight and die? No! Son of God,
who didst die to save us. No! ye angels,
whose wings are spread forth to shelter
us. No! ye prophets and apostles, whose
warnings startle us. No! 3e loved ones,
whose arms are outstretched to receive
us. No! we will never surrender!
Sure I must fight if I would roign
Be fahhful to my Lord;
And bear the Cross, endure the pain.
Supported by thy Word. '
Thy saints in all this glorious war
Shall conquer, though they die;
They see the triumph from afar
And seize it with their eye.
When that illustrious day shall rise.
And all thine armies shine
In robes of victory through the skies.
The glory shall be thine.
My hearers, shall we die in the arena
or rise to join our friends in the gallery?
Through Christ we may come off more
than conquerors. A soldier dying in
the hospital rose up in bed the last mo­
ment and cried, ""Here! Here!"" His ""at­
tendants put him back on his pillow and
asked him why he shouted ""Here!""
""Oh, I heard the roll call of heaven and
I was only answering to my name!"" I
wonder whether, after this battle of life
is over, our names will be called in the
muster roll of the pardoned and glori­
fied, and with the joy of heaven break­
ing upon our souls we shall cry, ""Here!
Here!""

Trifling with. Sacred Things.
I once frightened 200 colored people
almost to death. They were holding a
protracted meeting in a little tumble
down church near Nashville and the ex­
citement ran high. I attended with
some other bad boys, misbehaved and
was fired out. I determined to break
up the meeting. I procured some phos­
phorus, and the next night before the
crowd assembled drew skeletons, death's
heads and devils all over the walls. I
then concealed myself in the loft, armed
with a long hollow reed; while my com­
panions, provided with sheets and masks,
hid themselves in tho grove in which the
church was situated. That night the
church was packed and religious fervor
reached its climax. The preacher was
picturing the horrors of hell and the
hideonsness of its master and the sin­
ners were shivering with apprehension.
Two largo lamps hung in the center of
the low room furnished the light, and
by the help of the hollow reed I blew
them both out.
The preacher stopped in the middle of
his exhortation. Tho walls blazed forth
with horrors traced in burning, snaky
outlines. There was a convulsive gasp,
a scream from 200 throats and a stam­
pede. The preacher went through a
window, and, though a rheumatic, out­
ran all his parishioners. Then my
ghostly confederates appeared, uttering
dismal groans. Scores of the terrified
blacks, unable to run, lay down and
groaned with an agony of fear. The
joke was too good to keep. My father
heard of it. Ho was a Presbyterian
divine and did not believo'in trifling
with sacred things. It is said that lie
laughs best who laughs last, and tho
colored people came in on the subse­
quent cachination. Interview in St.

Coal Wortli More Than Clot lies.
Apropos of the way the coal barons
are grinding profits out of tho consumers
and propose etill further to continue the
grinding process, a little conversation
was heard last week at the Pennsylvania
railroad station in Jersey City that wa.­
very pat. A young New York business
man was at the station, waiting to meet
his mother, who lives with him here,
but hi:d been down in Pennsylvania
one of the small towns of the coal
regions vi:;iting relatives. Tho mothei
arrived, and after the usual oscillatory
greetings tho son bethought himself of
her baggage. She went to the baggage
room with him and pointed out a very
small trunk.
""1 brought all the clothes I took away
with ine back in that,"" she said.
""Brought back your clothes from
Pennsylvania!"" exclaimed the young
man in tones of mock surprise and dis­
tress. ""Brought clothes from Pennsyl­
vania to New York! Why, in the name
of all that is sensible, mother dear, did
you not throw away your clothes and
bring your trunk back full of coal?""

A Bad Dreak.
A doctor, who was treating one of his
patients f . a simple but tedious disorder,
found the man in such an irritable con­
dition that he began to cheer him np.
But his words fell ou deaf ears, for the
man had been housed up so long that ho
was firmly convinced that his time had
come.
""Tut, tut,"" said the doctor. ""I'll have
you round again in a few days if you'll
keep quiet and take the medicine. Why,
man, I suffer from the same complaint
as j'ou myself.""
There was a look of compassion in the
patient's eyes as ho reached out the bot­
tle and said:
""In that case, doctor, do take some of
this medicine you prescribed for me.""
The man had grown almost hopeful
under the influence of the doctor's reas­
suring words, but his hopes were cruelly
dashed the next moment ati the medical
man drew back from the bottle with a
shudder and replied, ""No, thanks.""

Somebody Was Looking:.
M. Sala tells the following: ""I was
present at the Jubilee garden party
given by her majesty at Buckingham
palace. My flower dropped out of my
buttonhole. A very pretty young serv­
ant presumably there for the purpose
of looking after our wearing apparel,
Iticks and umbrellas picked it up.
While in the act of putting it in my
coat again, with a view of obtaining a
peep into the queen's rooms, I asked her
if there was a chance of seeing them, at
the same time endeavoring to slip a sov­
ereign into her hand. She shrunk back.
I wish I could, sir,' she whispered, 'but

After the calamity in Paradise, not only did
the ox begin to pore, and the adder to sting,
and the elephant to smite with his tusk, and
the lion to put to bad use tooth and paw, but
under the very tree frdin which the forbidden
fruit was plucked were hatched out war and
revenge, and malice and envy and jealousy,
and the whole brood f cockatrices.
But against that scene I set the Bethlehem
manger, which says: ""Bless rather than
curse, endure rather than assault,"" and that
Christmas night puts out vindictiveness. It
says: ""Sheath your sword, dismount your
guns, dismantle your batteries, turn the war
ship Constellation, that carried shot and shell,
into a grain ship to take food to famished
Ireland, hook your cavalry horses to the
plow, use your deadly gunpowder in blasting
rocks and in patriotic celebration, stop your

harsh words from your vocabulary 'Good

exercise it until they apologize; 1 won't for­
give them until they ask me to forgive
them."" You are no Christian then I say
you are no Christian, or you are a very in­
consistent Christian. If you forgive not men
their trespasses, how can you expect your
Heavenly Father to forgive you? Forgive
them if they ask your forgiveness, and for­
give them anyhow. Shake hands all around.
""Good will to men.""
Oh, my Lord Jesus, drop that spirit into
our hearts this Christmas hour. I tell you
what the world wants more than anything
else more helping hands, more sympathetic
hearts, more kind words that never die, more
disposition to give other people a ride, and to
carry the heavy end of the load and give
other people the light end, and to ascribe
good motives instead of bad, and to find our
happiness in making others happy.
Out of that Bethlehem crib let tho bear and
the lion eat straw like an ox. ""Good will to
men."" That principle will yet settle all con­
troversies, and under it the world will keep
on improving until there will be only two
antagonists in all the earth, and they will
side by side take the jubilant sleigh ride inti­
mated by the prophet when he said: ""Holi­
ness shall be on tiie bells of the horses.""
III. Again, I remark that born that Christ­
mas night in the village barn was sym­
pathetic union with other worlds. The only
skepticism I have ever had about Christianity
was an astronomical skepticism which said:
""Why would God out of the heavens and
amid the Ju pi tors and Saturns of the uni­
verse have chosen our little bit of a world for
the achievements of His only begotten Son
when He might have had a vaster scale
and vaster worlds?"" But my skepticism is
all gone as I come to the manger and watch
its surroundings. Now I see all the worlds
are sisters, and that when one weeps they all
weep and when one sings they all sing.
From that supernatural grouping in the
cloud banks over Betheleheiu, and from the
especial trains that ran down to the scene, I
find that our world is beautifully and glori­
ously and magnificently surrounded. The
meteors are with us, for one of them ran to
point down to the birthplace. The heavens
are with us, because at the thought of our
redemption they roll bosanuas out of the
midnight sky.
Oh I yes; I do not know but our world may'
be better surrounded than we have some­
times imagined; and when a child is born
angels fetch it, and when it dies angels take
it, and when au old man bends under the
weight of years angels uphold him, and when
a heart breaks angels soothe it. Angels in
the hospital to take care of the sick. Angola
in the cemetery to watch our dead. Angels
in church ready to fly heavenward with the
news of repentant souls. Angels above the
world. Angels under the world. Angels all
around the world.
Kub the dust of human imperfection out
of your eyes, and look into the heavens and
see angels of pity, angels of mercy, angels of
pardon, angels of help, angels crowned,
angels charioted. The world defended by
angels, girdled by angels, cohorted by angels
clouds of angels. Hear David cry out:
""The chariots of God are twenty thousand.
Even thousands of angels."" But the mighti­
est angel stood not thut night in the clouds
over Bethlehem; the mightiest angel that
night lay among the cattle the Angel of the
new covenant.

                 ONLY A SONG.
                 IT was only a simple ballad,
                 Sung to a careless throng;
                 There were none that knew the singer,
                 And few that heeded the song: Yet the singer s voice wras tender
                 And sweet as with love untold
                 Surely those hearts were hardened,
                 That -it left so proud and cold.
                 She sang of the wondrous glory
                 That touches tile woods in spring, Of the strange soul-stirring voices
                 When "" the hills break forth and sing."" Of the happy birds low warbling
                 The requiem of the day,
                 And the quiet hush of the valleys
                 In the dusk of the gloaming gray.
                 And one in a distant corner,
                 A woman worn with strife, Hleard in that song a message
                 From the spring-time of her life: Fair forms rose up before her,
                 From the mist of vanished years; She sat in a happy blindness,
                 11er eyes were veiled in tears.
                 Then when the song was ended,
                 And hushed the last sweet tone, The listener rose up softly,
                 And went on her way alone. Once more to her life of labor

ful but not still. There is a low and me­
lodious trill of children in it: But Sunday
comes too still now. There is asilence that
aches in the eAr. There is too much room
at the table too emuch at the hearth; The

                 So be passed down my cottage-garden,
                 By the path that leads to the sea,
                 Till He came to the turn of the little road
                 Where the birch and laburnum-tree Lean over and arch the way;
                 There I saw him a moment stay,
                 And turn once more to me,
                 As I wept at the cottage-door,
                 And lift up His hands in blessing-
                 Then 1 saw His face no more.
                 And I stood still in the doorway,
                 Leaning against the wall,
                 Not heeding the fair white roses,
                 Though I crushed them and let them
                 fall;
                 Only looking down the pathway,
                 And looking toward the sea, And wondering and wondering
                 When He would come back for me; Till I was aware of an angel
                 Wbo was going swiftly by,
                 With the gladuess of one who goeth
                 In the light of God Most High.
                 He passed the end of the cottage
                 Toward the garden-gate- (I suppose he was come down At the setting of tlie sun
                 To comfort some one in the village
                 Whose dwelling was desolate)- And he paused before the door,
                 Beside my place,
                 And the likeness of a smile
                 Was on his face.
                 ""Weep not"" he said, ""for untoyonis given
                 To watch for the coming of His feet Who is the glory of our blessed heaven;
                 The work and watching will be very

                 And in such an hour as you think not
                 He will come.
                 So I am watching quietly
                 every day.
                 Whenever the sun shines brightly,

                 TI lit my head to watch the door and ask
                 If He is come;
                 And the angel answers sweetly
                 In my home:

                 As one who cons at evening o er an album all alone,
                 And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known; So I turn the leaves of fancy till in shadowy design
                 I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine.
                 The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise As I turn it  to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes.
                 And I light my pipe in silence, save a sigh that seems to yoke Its fate with my tobacco, and to vanish in the smoke.
                 'Tis a fragrant retrospection, for the loving thoughts that start Into being are like perfume from the blossoms of the heart; And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine,
                 When my truant fancy wanders with that old sweetheart of mine. Though I hear, beneath my study, like a fluttering of wings, The voices of my children and the mother as she sings, I feel no  of consc.ence to deny me any theme
                 When care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream. In fact, to speak in earnest, I believe it adds a charm To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm; For I find an extra flavor in memory s mellow vine
                 That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine. A face of lily beauty and a form of airy grace
                 Floats out of my tobacco as the genius from the vase; And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies.
                 I can see the pink sun-bonnet and the little checkered dress
                 She wore when first I kissed her, and she answered the caress With the written declaration that, "" as surely as the vine
                 Grewv 'round the stump, she loved me,"" that old sweetheart of mine. And again I feel the pressure of her slender little.hand
                 As we used to talk together of the future we had planned. When I should be a poet, and with nothing else to do
                 But to write the tender verses that she set the music to.
                 When we  live together in a cozy little cot Hid in a nest of roses, with a tiny garden spot,
                 Where the vines were ever fruitful and the weather ever fine,
                 And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine. When I should be her lover forever and a day,
                 And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray;
                 And we should be so happy that when either s lips were dumb They should not smile in heaven till the other s kiss had come. But, ah, my dream is broken by a step upon the stair.
                 And the door is softly opened, and my wife is standing there; Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign
                 To meet the living presence of that old sweetheart of mine","poetry"

From Golden Rule.
Every one appreciates a friend who is

considerate of his feelings and endeavors
to smooth the path before his feet,
whether science or society, learning or
laughter, be the goal. For this reason
the printer, and the editor as well, has a
warm regard for that indvldual who
sends legible, clean, folded copy to the
"" den,"" and, If need bo, he feeds ic to the
plethoric -waste-basket with a keeu feel-1:
Ing of regret. Iu the words of the poet,
not Longfellow :
There is a man the printer loves, and
he is wondrous wise; whene'er he w ites
the printer man he dotteth all his i's.
And when he's dotted all of them with
carefulness and ease, he punctuates each
paragraph, and crosses all his t's. Upon
one side alone he writes, and never rolls
his leaves ; and from the man of ink a
smile and mark "" Insert"" receives. And
when a question he doth ask taught
wisely he hath been he doth the goodly
penny stamp, for postage back, put in.
He gives the place from which he writes
his address the printer needs and
plainly writes his honored name, so he
that runneth reads. He writes, revises,
reads, corrects, and rewrites all again,
and keeps one copy safe, and sends one
to the printer man. And thus by taking
little pains, at trifling care and cost, as­
sures himself his manuscript will not be
burned or lost. And so he speaks through
all the laud, and thousands hear his
word, and in the coming day shall know
how much he served the Lord.
So let all those who long to write take
pattern by this man, with jet black ink
and paper white, do just the best they
can; and then the printer man shall
know, and bless them as his frieuds, all
through life's journey as they go, until
that journey ends.

"16","1089469","OF NAPOLEON.
Napoleon was conversing with Josephine
when one of his officers entered and an­
nounced a young woman from Lyons.
'What is her business with me?""
' ""Some petition, ""answered De Merville,
the officer. v
, ' ""Show her into our presence,"" said he.
; The officer soon re-appeared with a
. . . lady leaning upon his arm, whose face, as
much as could be scanned through the
thick folds of a veil, was very beautiful.
She trembled as she approached the door.
""Mademoiselle"" whispered her guide
kindly pressing her hand, -""take courage,

but answer prompt whatever question the
emperor proposes; he detests hesitation.""
Then ushering her into the spacious apart­
ment, he bowed and retired.
'. The trembling girl, perceiving Napole­
on, on whom her fondest hopes depended,
forgot herself and her timidity. She
thought only of another, and throwing
herself at the feet of Napoleon, exclaimed
with a voice choked with emotion:
t; ""Mercy, sire! I sue for mercy and par­
don."" , She could articulate no more,
Josephine stepped from her partial con­
cealment, and then approached the floor,
contributing more by her sympathising
words of encouragement to restore the
courage of the young petitioner, than even
the emperor, by the graciousness of his
manner, as he bade her rise. : , ?;;.
""Your petition; Mademoiselle,"" said he.
, Henrietta Armond (for that was her
name) looked imploringly at the emperor,
and exclaimed: ""Ah, sire, I ask pardon
for Louis Delamarre, who is condemned
to be shot to-morrow! O, grant him your
royal pardon!"", ,
A cloud gathered on the brow of Napo­
leon as he interrupted her with ""A de­
serter, mademoiselle, he has twice desert­
ed, 1 No, he roust be made an example for
the remainder of the regiment.""
. ""But the cause of his desertion!"" cried
llenriette, in agony? ""he was compelled
to join the army against his will.""
What were the causes of his desertion??'

' t ""Two weeks since,"" answered Henri

ette, ""he received news that an only re

that relief or release from his post was im

thought that she might not close her eyes

suppressed sroue. ; ; rr

she recollects that the affection of her son
for her is the cause of his death. "" What,""
she continued, ""can I do to save him?""
and the poor : girl, forgetting the presence
of royalty, burst into tears. - The kind
hearted Josephine glanced at the emperor
with eyes expressive of pity and sympa­
thy. She noticed the workings of his face,
and felt at once it ' was very uncertain
whether Louis Delamarre was to be shot
the next morning. 1 ' ' ' - ;
' Napoleon approached the weeping girl.
She hastily looked up and dried her tears.
""Mademoiselle,"" said hei ""would you
give your life for his? would you die could
Louis Delamarre be restored, to life, liber­
ty, and his mother?"" ', "","" ; 1
llenriette started back deadly pale,
looked fixedly at the emperor for a moment,
then turning away, she buried her face in
her hands.- .', "". . ' :' '''"" :'j
After a silence of some minutes, Hen­
riette looked up; an air of fixed determi­
nation rested upon her face. ' ""I am will­
ing,"" she said in a very low voice. , Na-
EoTeon looked at her in surprise, as if he
ad not anticipated so ready an answer to
his proposal. ""I will see you again,""
said he, ""in the meantime accept such
apartments for your accommodation as I
shall direct.""
As soon as the door closed on the fair
petitioner, Napoleon walked to the wind­
ow against which Josephine was leaning,
and said: ""I see how it is, Louis Dela­
marre is the lover of this young girl.
True to woman's nature, she has braved
difficulty and danger , to beg for his re­
lease."" . ; "" .,:
""How strong must be the love she bears
for him,"" said the empress.
""Ah!"" returned he, ""I have a mind to
subject the same love to a severer test.
Much I doubt whether she will give her
life for him. Nevertheless, I will see.""
""Sure,"" cried Josephine, ""you are not
serious. Louis certainly can be pardon­
ed without the death of Henriette.""
Napoleon drew nearer the window, and
they conversed in a low voice. . ,, .
Henriette stood alone in a magnificent
apartment. Hours passed unobserved, so
intensely was. she absorbed inrnreverie; a
small folded paper, was tightly graspad in
her small hand. On it were traced these
words
'-. '' '
A deserter is condemned by the law of
the army to suffer death. If you wish
Delamarre restored to liberty, the means
are in your power. t Ere day dawns he
may be on his way to join his mother,
whom he so much loves."" .
""Ah!"" murmured Henriette, ""do not I
love him too!"" Pressing her hands upon
her heart, as if to still its tumultuous beat­
ing, she paced the apartment. The door
opened and the Chevalier de Merville en­
tered. : He ; paused ere he articulated,
""Mademoiselle."" .
""I am ready,"" replied Henriette, ""my
decision is made."" . : 1
De Merville appeared to comprehend
the import of her words. He looked upon
her in reverence as well as admiration:
she stood with the high resolve impressed
on her beautiful brow. ""Follow me
mademoiselle,"" said he.. They traversed
long corridors and numerous suits of su­
perb apartments, and descending a stair
case, quicklv reached an outer court
communication with the guard house.
Entering this, Henriette was ushered into
a small apartment, where she was soon
left to herself. , i ...
On a chair was flung a uniform of the
regiment to which Louis belonged. On a
table lay a large plumed cap. - Henriette
comprehended all in a moment. Quickly
habiting herself in the uniform, she stood
before the mirror, and gathering up her
beautiful brown tresses in a knot, placed
the cap upon her head. - She almost utter­
ed a cry of joy at the success of her trans­
formation. She knew that she was to be
led to the fatal ground at the morning's
dawn.' - '' The bullet' which . would : have
struck Louis, would pierce her to the heart

over the timid woman nature. ""Louis

whispered. 1 ""Louis will never forget me.

A loud burst of applause from the lips
of the soldiers followed this announcement.
Not one of them but loved and. respected
their comrade. . The next moment, ere
they could press around to congratulate
the . supposed Louis, De Merville had
eagerly drawn the bewildered Henriette
through the crowd, back to the cell from
which she had emerged but a few moment
before. ; ,. , i j ... v; ': '
' ''Resume your dress again,' mademoi­

' Henriette was like one in a dream, but
a gleam of delicious hope thrilled her soul;
she felt the dawnings of happiness break
upon her heart. Soon again resuming her
pretty rustic habiliments, De Merville re
appeared and once again she trod the au­
dience room of the emperor. Lifting her
eyes from the ground as the lofty door
swung open she beheld Louis. An excla­
mation of joy burst from the lips of both
as, . regardless of others, they rushed into
each other's arms.
i Napoleon stepped forward. ""Louis
Delamarre,"" said he, ""you have just heard
from my lips the tale of this lovely girl's
devotion and courage. Do you love her
as she deserves?""
""I could die for her,"" answered Louis
proudly; ,,, ,. ; ; ; '

lover, will doubtless make the best of hus­

ette as your bride."" . .
""Here,"" aajd the benevolent Josephine,
emerging from the recessed window, ""here
Henriette, are one hundred louis d'ors as
vour marriage dowry.""
' A charming blush suffused the cheek of
the beautiful girl as she received the purse
from the hand of the empress.
""Long live Napoleon,"" exclaimed Louis
as with a heart too full of great emotion
for farther utterance, he took the hand of
Henriette, and making a graceful obeis­
ance, quitted the royal apartment.

One afternoon in the month of June, 1870,

to be passing at the time, and impelled by
curiosity followed her in to see whiit would
ensue. Stepping up to the bar and addres­
sing the proprietor, who happened to be

""Sir. canyon assist me? I have no home,
no friends, and am unable to work.""
He glanced at her, and then at the child,
with a mingled look of curiosity and rity.
Evidently he was soyiewhtt surprised to see
a woman itf such a place begging, .hut with­
out asking any questions gave her some
change, then turning to those present, te
said ; .
""Gentlemen, acre is a lady in distres3,
cant some of you assist her a little ?""
They all cheerfully acceded to this request,
and soon a purse of two dollars was raised
and placed in her hand.
""Madam,"" said the gentleman who gave
her the money, ""why do you come in sa­
loons? It isn't a proper place for a lady ;
atiii why are you driven to such a step ?""'
Turning her mournful, yet expressive eyes
upon th-s sneaker with an expression I shall
never forget, she replied :
""Sir, I know it isn't a proper place for me
to be in, and yon ask why I am driven to
this step. I will tell you in short words. ""
Pointing to a bottle boiiind tho bar labciocl

her in a chair she sang, in a sweet childish
voice, the following Leautiful song :

I have no mother dear, no plccsant home ;
Nobody cares for me, no one nould cry.

Asking for work, but I'm too small they say;

Mother crew pale and wept every dav

Found their dead faces all silent snd white ;
Then with big tears slowly dropping I said .

Poor, wretched father and talk very kind ;
If they would stop him from drinking, why thee

Or poor little Bessie must soon starve and die ;
All the day long I've been begging for bread.

The scene I shall never forget to my dying
day, anl the swfet cadence of her musical
voice still rings in my ears, and every word
of the song, as.it dropped from her lips,
sunk deep into the hearts of those gathered
around her. With.her golden curls falling
carelessly around her little shoulders, her
face of almost ethereal beauty, and looRIng
so trustingly and confidently upon the men
around, her beautiful eyes lighted up with a
light that seemed not of this earth, formed
a picture worthy of the pen of a poet or
painter, although a statue of purity and in­
nocence. The unfinished games of billiards
were laid by, the cards thrown aside, (lie un­
emptied glass remained upon the counter""
and all pressed near, some with curiosity,
some with, sadness, and Foroe with pity
beaming from their eyes, entranced with the
masieal voice and beauty of a child who
sremed better fit to be with r.:gels above
than in such a place.
At the ciose of the song many wore weep­
ing men who had not shed a tear for years
now wept like a child. One young man who
had resisted with scorn the pleadings of a
loving mother and dear friends to lead abet­
ter life, to desist from a course that was
wasting his fortune and ruining his hetdth,
now approached the child, .a""d taking her
hands while tears streamed down his pale
cheeks, exclaimed with deep emotion :
""God bless you. my little angel, you have
saved me from ruin and disgrace from pov­
erty and a. drunkard's grave. If there ever
was an angel oti esrtit yrti are one. God
bless yoti, God bless you,"" and placing a bill
in the hand of the mother, sa'.d, ""please ac­
cept ttiis triue is a token of my regard and
esteem, for your little girl has done me a
kindness no wealth can ever r?pp.y. And
whenever you are in want yoti will ever find
me a true friend,"" at the same time giving
her his name and address. Taking her child
by the 1 and she turned to go, but pausing at
the door, said :
""God bicss you, gentlemen, and- please
accept the heartfelt thanks of a poor and
friendless woman for the kindness and cour­
tesy you have shown her,"" and before any
one could reply, she was gone.
A silence of several minutes ensued which
was at last broken by the proprietorexcla'in-
""Gentlemen, that lady is right; I have
sold my last glass of whisky, and if any ( f
you want any more you will have to go else­
where."" "".
""And I-hare drank my last glass of whis­
ky,"" st-id a yciing man who had long been
-iriveri np us utterly beyond tlie reach of those
who had a deep interest in liia ivc-llan- that
he had sunk too low to ever reform. ""There
is a temperance organisation in this city call­
ed the Temple of Honor, and at their, next
meeting I shall send in my name to be ad­
mitted. Who will go with me?""
""I 1"" ""I !"" and ""1 1"" several exclaimed
in chorus, and fifteen names were added to
his. True to his word, tlie owner of the
saloon where this strange scene was enacted
disposed of his entire stock the next day,
and is now engaged in an honorable business.
Would to heaven that lady could have gone
intoevery hamlet and town and city through­
out our country, and meet with the same
cheering result.

PASTE IT IN YOUR BIBLE.
A CHAPTER VEIULT LIKE THE OBHU­
NAL HOW BKNJAMIN FRANKLIN
SLIUMII8ED Ilia KKIENDS.
Over one hundred years ago the
following so-called ""Genesis 51""
was used to puzzle Biblical scholars,
and to-day, were it read aloud in
any mixed company, it is question­
able if its fraudulent nature would
be discovered, so beautifully is the
spirit and language of the Old Tes­
tament imitated:
1. And it came to pass after
these things, that Abraham sat in
the door of his tent, about the going
down of the sun.
2. And behold a man, bowed
with age, came from the way of the
wilderness leaning on a staff.
3. And Abraham arose and met
him, and said unto him, Turn in, I
pray thec, and wash thy feet, and
tarry all night, and thou shalt arise
early on tho morrow, and go thy
way.
4. But the man said, Nay, for I
will abide under this tree.
5. And Abraham pressed him
greatly; so he turned, and they
went into the tent, and Abraham
baked unleavened bread, and they
did eat.
C. And when Abraham saw that
the man blessed not God, he said
unto him, Whtrefore dost thou not
worship the most high God, Creator
of heaven and earth?
7. And the man answered and
said, I do not worship the God thou
speakest of, neither do I call upon
his name ; for I have made to my­
self a God, which abidctli always in
my house and provideth me with all
things.
8. And Abraham's zeal was
kindled against the man, and be
arose and drove him forth with
blows into the wilderness.
9. And at midnight God called
unto Abraham, saying, Abraham,
where is the stranger?
10. And Abraham answered and
said, Lord, hewhould not worship
Thee, neither ""would he call upon
Thy name, therefore have I driven
him out from before my face into
the wilderness.
11. And God said, Have I not
borne with him these hundred and
ninety and eight years, and nou­
rished him, and clothed him, not­
withstanding his rebellion against
me, and couldst not thou ; that art
thyself a sinner, bear with him one
night?
12. And Abraham said, Let not
the anger of my Lord wax against
His servant ; lo I I have sinned, for­
give me, I pray thee.
13. And Abraham arose and
went forth into the wilderness, and
sought diligently for the man, and
found him and returned with him to
the tent, and when he had entreated
him kindly, he' sent him away on
the morrow with gifts.
14. And God spake again unto
Abraham, saying. For this thy sin
shall thy seed be afflicted 400 years
in a strange land.
15. But for thy repentance will
I deliver them, and they shall come
forth with power, and with gladness
of heart, and with much substance.
In 1759, when in England as
agent for the colony of Pennsyl­
vania, Benjamin Franklin privately
printed this ""Chapter,"" as he al­
ways termed it. Taking only a
sheet of paper, he kept it laid in
his Bible at the end of Genesis, and
used to amuse himself by reading it
aloud to his friends, and hearing
them express their surprise that
they bad never recollected reading
it, and their openly expressed ad­
miration of the moral it carried with
it. Its origin is unknown. It has
been traced back 700 years to a
Persian poet, who simply says ""it
was so related."" It must be very
old.

A Child's Dream of a Star.
There was once a child, and he strolled
about a good deal and thought of a num-

ber of things. He had a sister, who wis j busy at his book, when an old servant I under this impression that the amend-! hcnrd 51 foarful Soling, and nnxtmorn­

These two used to wonder all day long.
They wondered at the beauty of flowers ;
they wondered at the height and blue-
ness of the sky ; they wondered at the
depth of the bright water ; they won -
dered at the goodness and power of God,
who made the lovely world.
They used to say to one another some-
times, ""Supposing all the children on

the earth were to die, would the tkwers, . uited to her two children. And he 1 sponsible iue a great and general hard­

rhey believed they would
they would be sorry.
""For,"" said they, ""the buds are the
children of the flowers, and the little
playful streams that gambol down the
hillsides are the children of the waters ;
and the smallest bright specks, playing
at hide and seek in the sky all night,
must surely be the children of the stars ;
and they would all be grieved to see their
playmates, the children of men, no
more.""
There was one clear star that used to
come out in the sky before the rest,
near the church spire above the graves.
It was larger and more beautiful, they
thought, than all the others, and even-
night they watched for it, standing i
hand in hand at the Avindow. Whoever
saw it first cried out, "" I see the star !"" j
Vnd often they cried out both togetlu
knowing so well when it would rise, and
where. So they grew to be such friends
with it that before lying down in their j
beds they louked out once again to bid
it good night, and when they were turn-:
ing round to sleep they would say, "" God ,

longer stand in the window at night ; j
and then the child looked sadly out by
himself, and, when he saw tin's star
turned round to the patient, pale face on i
the bed, saying, ""I see the star!"" and j
then a smile would come upon his face 1
and a little weak voice used to say: i
i
"" God bless my brother and the star !""
And so the time came, all too soon, ,
when the child looked out alone, and j
when there was no face on the bed ; and j
when there was a little grave among the j
graves not there before ; and when the
star made long rays down toward him, 1
as he saw it through his tears. ,
Now these rays were, so bright, and j
they seemed to make such n beautiful, j
shining way from earth to heaven, that

him a great world of light, where many
All these angels, who were waiting,
turned their beaming eyes upon the
people who were carried up into the
stars ; and some came out from the long
rows in which they stood, and fell upon
the people's n epics and kissed them ten-
u'r1y, and went away with them down
avenues of light, and were so happy in j
their company, thai lying in the bed he
wept for joy.
But there were many angels who did
not go with them, and among them one j
he knew.
The patient face that had onco lain
upon the bed was glorified and radiant, !
but his heart found out his sister among
all the host.
His sister's angel hovered near the j
entrance of the star, and said to the j
leader among those who had brought j
the people thither j
"" Ls my brother come ?"" i
And he said ""No.""
She was turning hopefully away, when
the child stretched out his arms, and
said, "" Oh. sister, I am here ! Take
me !"" and then she turned her beaming
eyes upon him, and it was night; and the
star was shining into his room, making
long rays down toward him as he saw it
through his tears.
From that hour forth the child looked
out upon the star as on the home he was
to go to, when his time should come, and j
he thought he did not belong to narth
alone, but to the stur, too, because of his
sister's angel gone before.

There was a baby born, to be a brother
to the child; and while ho was so little
that he had never yet spoken a word, he
stretched his tiny form out on the bed
and died.
Again the cliild dreamed of the opened
star and of the company of angels, and
the train of people, and all the rows of
angels with their beaming eyes all turned

upon those people's faces.
Said his sister's angel to the leader :
"" Is my brother come ?""
And he said, "" Not that one, but an-
other.""
As the child beheld his brother's aucrel
in her arms, he cried, "" Oh, sister, I am

If You Please-
When the Duke of Wellington was
sick the last thing he took was a cup
of tea. On his servants asking him if
he would have it, the Duke replied:
i“Y""cs, if you please.” These were his
last words. Much kindness and cour­
tesy is expressed by them! lie who
had commanded the great armies in
| Europe, and had long borne the scep­
tre of authority, did not despise or
Overlook the small courtesies of life.
Ah, how many boys do? What a rude
tone of command they often use to
their little brothers and sisters, and
sometimes to their mothers! This is
ill bred and unchristian, and shows a
coarse nature and a hard heart. In all
iyour home talk remember “If you
please.” Among your playmates don’t
forget “If you please.” To all who
wait upon you and serve you, believe
i that “If you please” will make you
j better served than all the cross or
ordering words in the whole diction­
ary. Don’t forget the three little
words—“If you please.”
Life is made up, not of great sacri-
I fices or duties, but of little things, of
| which smiles and kindness and small
obligations, given habitually, are what
j win and prest-rve the heart, and secure
' the comfort.

                 ANOTHER hand is beckoning us,
                 Another call is given;
                 And glows once more with Angel-steps
                 The path which reaches Heaven.
                 Our young and gentle friend, whose smile
                 Made brighter summer hours, Amid the frosts of autumn time
                 Has left us with the flowers.
                 No paling of the cheek of bloom
                 Forewarned us of decay;
                 No shadow from the Silent Land
                 Fell round our sister s way.
                 The light of her young life went down,
                 As sinks behind the hill
                 The glory of a setting star,-
                 Clear, suddenly, and still.
                 As pure and sweet, her fair brow seemed
                 Eternal as the sky;
                 And like the brook s low song, her
                 voice,-
                 A sound which could not die.
                 And half we deemed she needed not
                 The changing of her sphere,
                 To give to Heaven a Shining One,
                 Who walked an Angel here. The blessing of her quiet life
                 Fell on us like the dew;
                 And good thoughts, where her footsteps
                 pressed
                 Like fairy blossoms grew.
                 Sweet promptings unto kindest deeds
                 Were in her very look;
                 We read her face, as one who reads
                 A true and holy book.
                 The measure of a blessed hymn,
                 To which our hearts could move; The breathing of an inward psalm;
                 A canticle of love.
                 We miss her in the place of prayer,
                 And by the hearth-fire s light;
                 We pause beside her door to hear
                 Once more her sweet ""Good-night !"" There seems a shadow on the day,
                 Her smile no longer cheers;
                 A dimness on the stars of night,
                 Like eyes that look through tears.
                 Alone unto our Father's will
                 One thought hath reconciled;
                 That He whose love  ours,
                 Bath taken home his child.
                 Fold her, 0 Father! in thine arms,
                 And let her henceforth be A messenger of love between
                 Our human hearts and thee.
                 Still let her mild rebuking stand
                 Between us and the wrong,
                 And her dear memory serve to make
                 Our faith in goodness strong.
                 And grant that she who, trembling here
                 Distrusted all her powers,
                 May welcome to her holier home

                 In the quiet nursery chambers,
                 Snowy pillows yet unpressed, See the forms of little ,
                 Kneeling, -robed, for their rest. All in quiet nursery ,
                 While the dusky shadows creep, Hear the voices of the children-
                 ""1 Now I lay me down to sleep."" In the meadow and the mountain
                 Calmly Phine the winter stars,
                 But across the glistening low-lands
                 Slant the moonlight s Filver bars. In tho silence and the darkness,
                 DarkneFs growing still more deep, Lieten to the little children,
                 Praying God their souls to keep. ""If we die""-so pray the children,
                 And the mother s head drops lorr; (One, from out her fold, is
                  Deep beneath the winter s snow,)

                 Walking evermore in white.
                 Little Fouls, that stand expectant,
                 Listening at the gates of life, Hearing, far away, the murmur
                 Of the tumult and the strife;
                 We who fight beneath those banners,
                 Meeting ranks of f&amp;eman there, Find a deeper, broader meaning
                 In your simple vesper prayer.
                 When your bands shall grasp the standard
                 W.hich to-day you watch from far,
                 When your deeds shall shape the conflict
                 In this universal war,
                 Pray to him, the God of battles,
                 Whose strong eye can never sleep, In the warring of temptation,
                 Firm and true your souls to keep. When the combat ends, and slowly
                 Clears the smoke from out the skies, When, far down the purple distance,
                 All the noise of battle dies,
                 When the last night s solemn shadows
                 Settle dark on you and me,
                 Blay the love that never faileth
                 Take our souls Eternally.

"160","42950142908","Luther, when studying, always had his dog lying at his feet-a  he had brought from Wartburg, and of which he was very fond. An ivory crucifix stood on the table before him, and the walls of his study were stuck round with caricatures of the Pope. He worked at his desk for days together without going out; but when fatigued, and the ideas began to stagnate in his brain, he would take his flute or his guitar with him into the porch, and there execute some musi- cal fantasy (for he was a skilful musician,) when the ideas would flow upon him as fresh as flowers after summer s rain. Music was his invariable solace at such times. Indeed, Luther did not hesitate to say, that after theology, music was the first of arts. ""1 Mu- sic,"" said he, ""is the art of the prophets; it
                 is the only other art, which, like theology, can calm the agitation of the soul, and put the devil to flight."" Next to music, if not before it, Luther loved children and flowers. That great, gnarled man had a heart as ten- der as a woman s.
                 Calvin studied in his bed. Every morn- ing, at five or six o clock, he had books, manuscripts and papers carried to him there, and he worked on for hours together. If he had occasion to go out, on his return he un- dressed and went to bed again to continue his studies. In his later years he dictated his writings to secretaries. He rarely cor- rected anything. The sentences issued com- plete from his mouth. If he felt his facility of composition leaving him, lie forthwith quitted his bed, gave up writing and com- posing, and went about his out-door duties for days, weeks, and months together. But so soon as he felt the inspiration fall upon him again, he went back to his bed, and his secretary set to work forthwith.
                 Cujas, another learned man, used to study when laid all his length upon the carpet, his face toward the floor, and there he revelled amidst piles of books which accumulated about him. The learned Amyot never stud- ied without the harpsichord beside him; and lie only quitted the pen to play it. Bentham, also, was extremely fond of the piano-forte, and had one in nearly every room in his house.
                 Richelieu amused himself in the intervals of his labor with a squadron of cats, of whom he was very fond. He used to go to bed at eleven at night, and after sleeping three hours, rise and write, dictate or work, till from six to eight o clock in the morning, when his daily levee was held. This worthy student displayed an extravagance equalling that of Wolsey. His annual expenditure was some four millions of francs, or about ?170,000 sterling.
                 How different the fastidious temperance of Milton! He drank water and lived on the humblest fare. In his youth, lie studied during the greatest part of the night; but in his more advanced years he went early to bed-by nine o clock-rising to his studies at four in summer and five in winter. He studied till mid-day; then he took an hour s exercise, and after dinner he sang and played the organ, or listened to others' music. He studied again till six, and from that hour till eight he engaged in conversation with friends who came to see him. Then lie supped, smoked a pipe of tobacco, drank a glass of water, and went to bed. Glorious visions
                 came to him in the night, for it was then, while lying on his couch, that he composed in thought the greater part of his sublime poem. Sometimes when the fit of composi- tion came strong upon him, he would call his daughter to his side, to commit to paper that which he bad composed.
                 Milton was of opinion that the verses composed by him between the autumnal and spring equinoxes were always the best, and he was never satisfied with the verses he had written at any other season. Alfieri, on the contrary, said that the equinoctial winds pro- duced a state of almost a complete stupidity"" in him. Like the nightingale, be could only  in summer. It was his favorite season.
                 Pierre Corneille, in his loftiest flights of imagination, was often brought to a stand still for want of words and rhyme. Thoughts were seething in his brain, which he vainly tried to reduce to order, and be would often run to his Thomas * for a word."" Thomas rarely failed him. Sometimes, in his fits of inspiration, he would bandage his eyes, throw himself on the sofa, and dictate to his wife, who almost worshipped his genius. Thus he would pass whole days, dictating to her his great tragedies; his wife scarcely ven- tured to speak, almost afraid to breathe. Afterwards, when a tragedy was finished, ho would call in his sister Martha, and submit it to her judgment; as Moliere used to con- sult his old housekeeper about the comedies he had newly written.
                 Racine composed his verses while walking about, reciting them in a loud voice. One day, when thus working at his play of Mith- , in the Tuileries Gardens, a crowd of workmen gathered around him, attracted by his gestures; they took him to be a madman about to throw himself into the basin. On his return home from such walks, he would write down scene by scene, at first in prose, and when he had thus written it out, he would exclaim-* My tragedy is done,"" con- sidering the dressing of the acts up in verse as a very small affair.
                 Maagliabecchi, the learned librarian to the Duke of Tuscany, on the contrary, never stirred abroad, but lived amidst books, and lived upon books. They  his bed, board, and washing. He passed eight and forty years in their midst, only twice in the course of his life venturing beyond the walls of Florence; once to go two leagues off, and the other three and a half leagues, by order of the Grand Duke. He was an extremely frugal man, living upon eggs, bread and water, in great moderation.
                 The life of Liebnitz was one of reading, writing, and meditation. That was the se- cret of his prodigious knowledge. After an attack of gout, he confined himself to a diet of bread and milk. Often lie slept in a chair; and rarely went to bed till after mid-
                 night. Sometimes he was months without quitting his seat where he slept by night and wrote by day. He had an ulcer in his right leg which prevented his walking about, even had he  to do so","poetry"

KISS HER AND TELL HER SO.
You've a neat little wife at home, John,
As sweet as you'd wish to see;
As faithful and gentle-hearted,
As fond as wife can be;
Agenuine, home-loving woman,
Not carong for fuss and show;
she's dearer to you than life, John;
Then kiss her and tell her so.
Your dinners are promptly served, John,
As, likewise, your breakfast and tea;
Your wardrobe is always in order,
With buttons where buttons should be.
Her house is a cosy home-nest, John,
A heaven of rest below:
You think she's a rare little treasure;
Then kiss her and tell her so.
8he's a good wife and true to you, John,
Let fortune be foul or fair;
Of whatever comes to you, John,
She cheerfully bars her share;
You feel she's a brave, true helper,
And perhaps far more than you know
'Twill lighten her end of the load, John,
Just to kiss her and tell her so.
There's a cross-road somewhere in life, John,
Where a hand on a guiding stone
Will signal one ""over the river,""
And the other must go on alone.
Should she reach the last milestone first, John
'Twill be comfort amid your woe
To know that while loving her here, John,
You nissed her and told her so.

                 I was sitting in my study
                 Writing letters, when I heard:
                 -Please, dear mamma, Mary told me,

                 ""Not now, darling; mamma's busy,

                 No, no, mamma, me wite letter- Tan if 'ou will show me how.""
                 I would paint my darling's portrait,
                 As his sweet eyes searched my face- Hair of gold and eyes of azure,
                 Form of childish, witching grace. But the eager face was clouded,
                 As I slowly shook my head,
                 'Till I said : - I'll make a letter
                 Of you, darling boy, instead."" So I parted back the tresses
                 From his forehea(d high and white, And a stamp in sport I pasted
                 'Mid its waves of golden light. Then I said : "" Now, little letter,
                 Go away, and bear good news,""
                 And I smiled, as down the staircase
                 Clattered loud the little shoes. Leaving me, the darling hurried
                 Down to Mary in his glee:
                 ""Mamma's writing lots of letters.
                 I's a letter, Mary-see ! ""
                 No one heard the little prattler,
                 As once more he climbed the stair, Reached his little cap and tippet,
                 Standing in the entry there.
                 No one heard the front door open,
                 No one saw the golden hair As it floated o'er his shoulders,
                 In the crisp October air.
                 Down the street the baby hastened,
                 Till he reached the office door: -I's a letter, Mr. Postman;

                 But the clerk in wonder answered:

                 Fain the clerk would have detained him,

                 And the little feet were hastening-
                 By the busy crowd swept on.
                 Suddenly the crowd was parted,
                 People fled to left and right, As a pair of maddened horses,
                 At the moment dashed in sight. No one saw the baby figure-
                 No one saw the golden hair,
                 Till a voice of frightened sweetness,
                 Rang out on the autumn air.
                 'Twas too late-a moment only,
                 Stood the beauteous figure there; Then the little face lay lifeless,
                 Covered o'er with golden hair.
                 Reverently they raised my darling,
                 Brushed away the curls of gold, Saw the stamp upon the forehead,
                 Growing now so icy cold.
                 Not a mark the face disfigured,

When he was a little boy in petticoats, in his fourth year, one fine day in spring his father led him by the hand to a distant part of the farm, but soon sent him home alone. On the way lie had to pass a little pond-hole, then spreading its waters wide. A rhodora in full bloom -a rare plant In the neighborhood, and which grew only in that locality-attracted his attention and drew him to the spot. IHe saw a lit-

Hu lifted the stick he had in his hand to strike the harmless reptile; for, though he had never killed any creature, yet he had seen other boys out of sport destroy birds, squlrrels, and the like, and he felt a disposition to follow their example. ""But all at once,"" he says, "" something checked my little arm, and a voice within me said, clear and loud, IIt is wrong.' I held my uplifted stick with wonder at the new emotion-the consciousness of an involuntary but inward check upon my actions-till the tortoise and the rhodora both vanished from my sight. I hastened home, told the tale to my mother, and asked what was it that told me it was wrong. She wiped a tear from her eye with her apron, and, taking me in her arms, said, 'Some men call it conscience, but I prefer to call It the voice of God in the soul of man. If you listen and obey it, then it will speak clearer and clearer, and always guide you right; but If you turn a deaf ear, or disobey, then it will fade out little by little, and leave you all in the dark and without a guide. Your life depends on your heeding this little voice!' She went her way, careful and troubled about many things, but doubtless pondered them in her motherly heart; while I went off to wonder and think it over In my poor, childish way.

                 An extract from one of her letters to Mr. Garfield, which appeared in the Student, a paper published by the students of Hiram College, shows in a marked degree culture of mind and heart. The letter was written about ten years ago and was intended only for the eyes of Mr. Garfield, but somehow it fell into the hands of the president of the College, and he made use of it in a lecture to the students. It is as follows: ""I am glad to tell that out of all the toil and disappointments of the summer just ended, I have risen up to a victory; that silence of thought since you have been away has won for my spirit a triumph. I read something like this the other day: 'There is no healthy thought without labor, and thought makes the labor happy.' Perhaps this is the May I have been able to

                 Love gives it energy- love gave it birth.
                 Where, on thy dewy wing- Where, art thou journeying?
                 Thy lay is in heaven -thy love is on earth.
                 O'er fell and fountain sheen,
                 O'er moor and mountain green,
                 O'er the red streamer that heralds the day;
                 Over the  dim,
                 Over the rainbow s rim,
                 Musical cherub, soar, singing, away!
                 Then, when the gloaming comes, Low in the heather blooms,
                 Sweet will thy welcome and bed of love be!
                 Emblem of happiness,
                 Blest is thy dwelling-place -

talTn;icle tho Rev. T. De Witt Talmnge, D,

ure, utter which the congregation sang the
favorite hymn: ""There is rest for the weary.""
The reverend il'w tor's text was Acts vii, SIMM):
""Heholrl, I see the heavens opened, and the Bon
of Man standing on the l ight hnnd of God.
Then they cried out with a loud voice and
stopped their ears, und ran upon him with one
aecrd, and cast him out of the city, and
fctoned him; and the witnesses laid down their
t-lot'ies a t:i young man's feet whoso name was
Haul. And they stoned Stephen, calling upon
(rod, and sayinu', Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit. And he kneeled down, and cried with
ii loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge. And when he had said tliis, ho fell
asleep."" The preacher said:
Stephen had been preaching a rousing ser­
mon, and the people could not stand it.
They resolved to do as men sometimes would
like to do in this day, if they dared, with
soiiio plain preacher of righteousness kill
liim. Tho only way to silence this man was
to knock the breath out of him. So they
rushed Stephen out of the gates of the city,
ond with curse, and whoop, and bellow they
brought him to tho cliff, as was the custom
when lliey wanted to take away life by ston­
ing. Having brought him to the edge of tho
-litf they pu.-heil him off. After he had fall­
en they came and looked down, and uecing
that he was not, yet dead, they Wgnn to drop
' stones upon him, steue after :-t ue, stono aft r
stone. Amid this hoiTiblo rain of missiles,
Stephen clambers up on his knees and folds
Iiis hands, while tho blood drips from hi
temples to his checks, from Irs cheeks to Lis
-garments, from his garments to the ground;
and then, looking up, lie makes two prayers,
one for himself ami one for his murderers.
""Lord Jifc.us, receive my spirit:"" that was for""
liimself. ""Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge;"" thut was for his assailants. Then,
from pain and loss of blood, ho swooned
away und fell asleep.
1 want to show you to-day five pictures
Stephen gazing into heaven, Stephen looking
at Christ, Stephen stoned, Stephen iti his dy
ing prayer, Stephen asleep.
First, look at Stephen gazing jnto heaven.
Before you take a leap you want to know
where you are going to land. Before you
climb a ladder you want to know to what
point the ladder reaches. And it was right
that Stephen, within a few moments of
heaven, should bo gazing into it. Wo would
all do well to lie found in the same posture.
There is enough in heaven to keep us gazing.
A man of large wealth may have statuary in
tho hall, and paintings in the sitting room,
and works of art in all parts of the house;
lmt he has the chief pictures in the art gal-
3wy, aud there, hour after hour, you walk
with catalogue and glass and ever increasing
admiration. Well, heaven is the gallery
where. God has gathered th chief treasures
of his realm. Tho whole universe k Li-
palace. In this lower room where we stop
there are many adornments tessellated floor
of amethyst mid blossom, and on the winding
cloud stairs are stretched out canvas on which
comminglo azure, and purple, and saffron, and
gold. But heaven is the gallery in which the
chief glories are gathered. There are the .
brightest robes. There are the richest crowns.
There are tho highest exhilarations. John
says of it: ""The kings of the earth shall
bring their honor and glory into it.""
And I see the procession forming; and in
tho line oomo all empires, and the stars spring
tip into an arch for tho hosts to march under.
They keep step to the sound of earthquake
mid the pitch of avalanche from the moun­
tains, and the Hag they bear is the flame of a
consuming world, and all heaven turns out
with harps and trumpets and my riud voiced
acclamation of angelic dominion to welcome
them in, and so tho kings of the earth bring
their honor and glory into it. Do you won­
der that good people often stand like Stephen,
looking into heaven? Wo have a great many
friends there. There is not a man in this
liouso to-day so isolated in life but there is
some- one in heaven with whom he once shook
bauds. As a man gets older tho number of
lils celestial acquaintances very rapidly
multiplies. Wo have not had one glimpse of
them since the night wo kissed them goodby
nud they went away; but still we stand
gating at heaven. As when some of our
lriemls go across the sea we stand on the
dock or on the ste.imtug and watch them,
and after awhile tho hulk of the vessel""dis­
appears, and then there is only a patch of
sail on the sky, aud soon she is gone, and they
are all out of sight, and yet we stand looking
in tho same direction; so when our friends go
away from us into the future world we keep
looking down through the Narrows, and gaz­
ing and gazing. a3 though we expected that
they would como out und stand oa some
evening cloud, and give us one glimpse of
their blissful and transfigured faces. While
jou long to join their companionship, and
the years and the days go with such tedium
that they break your heart, and the viper of
niu and sorrow and bereavement keeps
gnawing at your vitals you still stand, like
f-ltepheu, gazing into heaven. You wonder if
they have changed since you saw t hem last.
Von wonder if they would recognize your
face now, so chnnged has it lieeii with trouble.
"" You wonder if, amid the myriad delights
li'jey have, they care as much for you as they
nseW to when they gave you a helping hand
nd pnMheir shoulder under your burdens.
You wonder if they look any older; and
sometimes, in the eveningtide, when the
liouso is all quiet, you wonder if you should
all them by their first name if they would
jot answer, and perhaps sometimes you do
liinko the experiment, und when no one but
4!od and yourself are there you distinctly
call their names, ami listen and wait, and sit
cii.iuir into heaven.
l'ass on now and see Stephen looking upon
Christ. My text says he saw the Son of man
at the right hand of God. Just how Christ
looked ill this world, just how he looks in
lieaven. we cannot say. A writer in the time
of Christ says, describing the Saviour's per
sonal appearance, that he had blue eyes and
light complexion, aud a very graceful struc
ture; but I suppose it was all guesswork.
Tho painters of tho different ages have tried
to imagine the features of Christ, and put
them upon canvas; but we will have to wait
until with our own eyes we see him and with
our own ears we can hear him. And yet
there is a way of seeing and henring him
now. I havo to tell you that unless you see
and hear Christ on earth, you will never see
and hear liiin in heaven; Ixxikl There he
is. Behold the Lamb of God. Can you not
him? Then pray to Cod to take the
cakw off your eyes. Look thut way try to
look that way. His voice comes down to
you this day comes down to the blindest, to
the deafest soul, saying: 'Look unto me, all
3'e ends of tho earth, and lie ye Hived, for J
nni I hid, and there is none else."" I'roclania

welcomed t he czar of Russia and the suitna

many was glad to have our minister, George
Bancroft, sit down with him at his table; but
tell me, ye who know mast of the world's his
tory, what other king ever asked tire aban­
doned, and the forlorn, and the wretched, and
the outcast to come and sit down beside him?
Oh, wonderful- invitation I You can take it
to-day and stand at the head of the darkest
alley in all this city and say: ""Come! Clothes
for your rags, salve for your sores, a throne
for your eternal reigning."" A Christ that
talks like that, and acts like that, and pardons
like that do you wonder that Stephen stood
looking at him? I hope to spend eternity do­
ing tho same thing. I must see him. I must
look upon that face, once clouded with my sin,
but now radiant with my pardon. I want to
touch that baud that kuocked ol my
shackles I want to hear that voice which
pronounced my deliverance. Behold him,
littie children, for if you live to three score
years and ten you will see none so fair. Bo-
hold him, ye aged ones, for he only can slnne
through the dimness of your failing eyesight.
Behold him. earth; behold him, heaven!
What a moment when all tho nations of tho
saved shall gather around Christ! All faces
that way; all thrones that way, gazing on
Jesus.
His worth, if all the nations knew.
Sure the whole earth would love, him too.
I pass on now, and look at Stephen stoned.
The world has always wanted to get rid of
good men. Their very life is an assault upon
wickedness. Out with Stephen through the
gates of the city. Down with him over tho
precipices, tjet every man come up ana urop
a stone upon his head. But these men did not
so much kill Stephen as they killed them­
selves. Every stone rebounded upon thein.
While these murderers were transfixed by the
scorn of all good men, Stephen lives in the
ndinirat ion of all Christians. Stephen stoned ;
but Stephen alive. So all good men must bo
pelted. All who will live godly in Christ
Jesus must suffer persecution. It is no eulogy
of a man to say that everybody likes him.
Show me any one who is doing all bis duty to
state or church and I will show you scores of
men who utterly abhor him.
If all men speak well of you it is because
you aro either a laggard or a dolt. If a
steamer makes rapid progress through the
waves the water will boil and foam all around
it. Brave soldiers of Jesus Christ will hear
the carbines click. When I see a man with
voice and money and influence all on tho
right side, and some caricature him and some
sneer at him and some denounce him, and
men who pretend to lie actuated by right
motives conspire to cripple him, to
cast him out, to destroy him, I say: ""Stephen
stoned."" When I see a man in some great
moral or religious reform battling against
grog shops, exposing wickedness in high
places, by active means trying to purify the
church and better the world's estate, and I
find that the newspapers anathemize him, and
men, even good men, oppose him and de­
nounce him, because, though he docs good,
he does not do it in their way, I say j ""Stephen
stoned."" The world, with inliuite spite, took
after John Frederick Oberlin, and Robert
Moffat, and Paul, and Stephen of the text.
But you notice, my friends, that while they
assaulted him they did not succeed really in
killing him. You, may assault a good man,
but you cannot kill him. On the day of his
death, Stephen spoke before a few people in
the Sanhedrim; this Sabbath morn he ad
dresses all Christendom. Foul, the apostle,
stood on Mars Rill addressing a handful of
philosophers who knew not so much about
science as a modern school girl. To-day ho
talks to all the millions of Christendom about
the wonders of justification and tho glories
of resurrection. John Wesley was howled
down by the mob to whom be preached, ncd
they threw bricks at him, ana they denounced
bun, mid jostled him, and they spat upon hun,
and yet to-day, in all lands, he is admitted to
lie the great father of Methodism. Booth's
bullet vacated the presidential chair, but
from that spot of coagulated blood on the
floor in the box of Ford's theatre there sprang
up the new life of a nation. Stephen stoned:
but Stephen alive.
Bass on now, and see Stephen In bis dying
prayer, liis nrst tuougut was not how tue
stones hurt his head, nor what would become
pf his body. His first thought was about bis
spirit, ""Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."" The
murderer standing on the trap door, the
black cap being drawn down over his head
before the execution, may grimace about the
future; but you and I have no shame in con­
fessing some anxiety about where we are go
ing to come out. You are not all body. There
is within you a soul. I see it gleam from your
eyes today, and X see it irradiating your coun
tenance. Sometimes I am abashed before an
audience, not because I come under your phy
sical eyesight, but because I realize the truth
that I stand before so many immortal spirits.
Tho probability is that your body will at last
find a sepulture in some of the cemeteries that
surround this city. There is no dohbt but
that you will will be able to pillow your head
under the maple, or the Norway spruce, or
the cypress, or the blossoming fir; but this
spirit about which Stephen prayed, what
direction will that take? What guide will
escort it! What gate will open to receive
it? What cloud will be cleft for its pathway
After it has got beyond the light of our sun
will there be torches lighted for it the rest of
the way? Hill the soul have to travel
through long deserts before it reaches the
good land? If we should lose our pathway.
will thero be a castle at whose gate we mav
ask tho way to the city? O, this mysterious
spirit withiu us! It has two wings, but it is
in a cage now. It is locked fast to keep it
but let the door of this rage ojien tho least.
and that soul is off. Eagle's wing could not
catch it. The lightnings arc not swift enou.
to take tip with it. When the seul leaves tho
body jt takes fifty worlds at a bound. And
have I no anxiety about it? Have you no
anxiety about it? I do not care what you do
with my body when my soul is gone, or
whether you believe in cremation or inhuma
tion. I shall sleep just as well in a wrapping
of sackcloth as in satin lined with eagle's
down. But my soul before I leave this
house this morning I will fhid out where it is
eoiug to laud. Thank God for the intimation
of my text, that when we die Jesus takes us.
That answers all questions for me. What
though there were massive lws between here
and the city of light; Jesus could remove
them. What though there were great Sa-j
bnras of darkness; Jesus could illume them.
What though I .set weary on the way; Christ
could lift me on his omnipotent shoulder.
What though there were chasms to cross; his
hand could transport mo, Then let Stephen's
prayer l my dying litany ""Lord Jesus, re­
ceive my spirit."" It may be in that hour we will
bo too feeble to say a long prayer; it may be
we will not be able to say the Loid's prayer, for
it has seven petitions. . Perhaps we may be
too feeble even to say the infant prayer our
mothers taught us, which !John Quincy
Adams, 70 years of age, said every night
when he put his head upon his pillow:
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the I.orci my soul to keep.
We may 1 too feeble to employ either of
these familiar forms; but this prayer of
Stephen is so short, iu so concise, is so earnest,
is so comprehensive, we surely will 1 able
to say that: ""Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.""
Oh, if that prayer is answered, how sweet it
will be to die! This ivoi Id is clever enough

to us. Perhaps it has treated us a great deal
better than we deserved to be treated; but if
on the dying pillow there shall break the
light of that better world, we shall have no
more regret about leaving a small, dark,
damp house or one large, beautiful and ca­
pacious. That dying minister in Philadelphia,
some years ago, beautifully depicted it when,
in the lost moment, he threw up bis hands
and cried out:
""I move into the light!""
Pass on now and I will show you one more
picture, and that is Stephen asleep. With a
pathos and simplicity peculiar to the Scrip­
tures, the text says of Stephen: ""Ho fell
asleep."" ""Oh,"" you say, ""what a place that
was to sleep ! A hard rock under him, stones
falling down upon him, the blood streaming,
the mob howling. What a place it was to

sleep!"" And yet my text takes that symbol
of slumber to describe his departure, so sweet
was it, so contented was it, so peaceful was
it. Stephen had lived a very laborious life.
His chief work had been to caro for the poor.
How many loaves of bread he distributed,
how many bare feet lie had sandaled, how
many cots of sickness and distress he blessed
with ministries ef kindness and love, I do not
know; but from tho way he lived, and the
way ho preached, and tho way he died, l
know he was a laborious Christian. But that
is all over now. Ha has pressed the cup to

The Pigmy and the Giant.
That the worm will turn, under certain
provocation, is an undisputed axiom, but to
what avail it has ever been difficult to dis­
cover. The Volts Zeitung is a plucky, out­
spoken journal, and in consequence Prince
Bismarck caused tho editor to bo proceeded
against, but failed in the undertaking. Now
the proprietor has turned plaintiff and has
prosecuted the German chancellor for parlia­
mentary offenses against the paper and its
editor. The public prosecutor, however, has
given it as his decision that, as Prince Bis­
marck is a general of cavalry, he can only be
made answerable to a military court
To this The Volks Zeitung retorts that tho
prince has never commanded with the colors
and that his rank of general is purely honor­
ary. In supjort of this view it draws atten­
tion to the fact that only tho other day the
chancellor exercised, as he always has done,
his right of voting for a parliamentary can­
didate, although soldiei-s on active service en­
joy po electoral privileges. The Volks Zei­
tung announces quite seriously that it intends
to carry the case through all the civil courts,
and, if necessary, before a military tribunal,
which will have one effect, that of worrying
the chancellor to desperate resorts, as he has
a terror of anything in the way of cross­
examination. This contest between the pigmy
and the giant will arouse a great deal of
interest in the fatherland.

BIB! IS DEAD. res
One of the most touchingly beau- set
tiful tributes to a dead baby that has lea
fallen under our notice for many a
day is from the editor of the Tele- eni

""Baby is dead !"" Three little
weods passed along the line; copied col

hand upon my head, and fell into a lik
deep reverre of all that those words
mean. Somewhl-re-.&amp;, dainty form,
still and cold, unclasped b3. mother's
arms to-night. Eyes that yes y th
were bright and blue as skies of June
drooped to-night beneath white lids
that no voice can ever raise again.- on
Two soft hands, whose rose-leaf fin th
gers were wont to wander lovingly
around motheris neck and face, loose= ha
ly holding white buds, quietly folded ea
in confined rest. Soft lips, yestcr­
ay rippling with laughter, sweet as sti
woom4 brook falls, gay as trill of fo
forest birds; to-eight unresponsive
to kiss or call of love:-A -silent home wl
-the patter of baby feet forever si
hushed-a cradle bed stippressed, bl
little shoes half worn-dainty gar­
ments, shoulder knots of blue to
match those eyes of yesterday, fold- Ci
ed with aching heart away. A tiny
mound snow-covered in some quiet
graveyard. A mother's groping
touch in uneasy slumber, for the fair
head that shall never again rest upon
herbosom. The low sob, the bitter
tear, as broken dreams awake to sad
e reality. The hope of future years a
a wrecked, like fair ships that sudden­
s ly go down in sight of land. The
. watching of other babies, dimpled, d
laughing, strong, and this one gone! f
The present agony of grief, the in- ri
ture emptiness o( heart, are held in
', those three little words-""Baby is
dead!"" Indeed, it is well that we s
copy and soon forget the words so i
- freighted with woe to those who re- n
ceive and send them. And yet it i
cannot harm us now and then to give
i- a tender thought to those for whom L
our careless pen-stroke is preparing r
such a weight of grief.

                 In the  by,'is spoken still. A trim-built home on a sheltered bay;
                 A wife looking out on the glistening sea; A prayer for the loved one far away,
                 And prattling imps 'neath the old roof-tree; A lifted latch and a radiant face
                 By the open door in the falling night; A welcome home and a warm embrace

                 Children's laughter and old men s sighs,

"212","68476","THE ART OF NOT HEARING.
The following article has come across the Atlantic
in the columns of Reynold's Miscellany, but we be­
lieve it originated with Henry Ward Beecher, in
the New-York Ledger. Whatever its origin may
have been, it is well worthy of notice:
The art of not hearing should be taught in every
well regulated family. It isfull as important to do­
mestic happiness as a cultivated ear, for which so
much money and time are expended. There are so
many things which are painful to hear-many which
we ought not to hear-very many which, if heard,
will disturb the temper, corrupt simplicity and mod­
esty, detract from contentment and happiness; that
every one should he educated to take in or shut out
sounds, according to their pleasure. t
If a man falls into a violent passion, and calls me
all manner of names, the first word shuts my ear
and I bear no more. If, in my quiet voyage of life,
I find myself caught in one of those domestic whirl­ a
winds of scolding, I shut my ears, as a sailor wouldi f
unfurl his sails, and making all tight, scud before it
the gale. If a hot and restless man begins to in­
flame my feelings, I consider what mischief these I
fiery sparks may do in the magazines below, where o
my temper is kept, and instantly close the door. b
Does a gadding, mischief-making fellow begin to I
inform me what people are saying about me, down 0
drops the portcullis of my ear, and he can not get i
in any farther. Does the collector of a sieighbor's a
scandal ask my ear as a warehouse, it instinctively
shuts up. Some people seem anxious to hear every h
thing that will vex and annoy them. If it is hinted i
that any one has spoken evil of them, they set
about searching the matter and finding it out. If all e
the pretty things said of one by heedless or ill-na­
tured idlers were to be brought home to him, he ti
would become a mere walking pincushion, stuck full 5
of sharp remarks. I would as soon thank a man y
for emptying upon my bed a bushel of nettles, or
setting loose a swarm of ants in my chamber, or W
raising a pungent dust in my house generally, as to ft
bring in upon me all the tattle of careless or spite­ u
ful people. If you would be happy, when among
good men, open your ears, when among bad shut h
them. And as the throat has a muscular arrange­ d
ment by which it takes care of the air passages of
its own accord, so the ears should he trained to an
automatic dullness of hearing. It is not worth
while to hear what your servants say when they are
angry; what your children say after they have
slammed the door; what your neighbors say about h
your children; what your rivals say about your bus­
iness, your dress, or your affairs.
This art of not hearing, though untaught in the h
schools, is by no means unknown or unpracticed in c
society. I have noticed that a well bred woman 6
never hears an impertinent or a vulgar remark. A
kind of oisereet deafness saves one from many in.
sults, from much blame, fr.sm not a little apparent 5
connivance in dishonorable conversation.
There are two doors inside my ears-a right hand
door leading to the heart, and a left hand door with
a broad and steep passage out into the open air.
This last door receives all ugliness, profanity, vul­
garity, mischief-making, which suddenly find them­
selves outside of me. Judicious teachers and indul­
gent parents save young urchins a world of trouble
by a convenient deafness, bankers and money-lend­
ers often are extremely hard of hearing, when un­
safe borrowers are importunate. I never hear a
man who runs after me in the street, bawling my
name at the top of his voice; nor persons that talk
evil of those who are absent; nor those who give
me unasked advice about mv own affairs; nor those
who talk largely about things of which they are ig­
norant.
If there are sounds of kindness, of mirth, of love,
open fly my ears. But temper, or harshness, or ha­
tred, or vulgarity, or flattery, shut them. If you
keep your garden gate shut, your flowers and fruit
will be safe. If you keep your door closed, no
thief will run off with your silver; and if you keep
your ears shut, your heart will lose neither its flow.

Proctor repeated his lecture, on 'The Birth and Growth of the Universe,' at tho Theatre Royal last Monday night, bofore an audience which filled tho theatre in every part. The eminent astronomer wag enthusiastically received on his appearance upon the stage, and was listened to with wrapt attention throughout, as he unfolded the wonderful tale of the universe. As on i n. - j. ? ^ i n It t . ? me nrst nigni oi tno lecture, Mr. Proctor appropriately concluded his peroration with a recital of Jean Paul Richter's 'Dream,' which we give as follows ' ' God called up from dreams a man into tho vestibule of heaven, saying, ' Come thou hither, and see the glory of my house.' And to the servants that stood around His throne He said, ' Take him, and undress him from his robes of flesh : cleanse his vision, and put a now breath .into his nostrils; arm him with sail-board wings for flight. Only touch not with any change his human heart— the heart that weeps and trembles.' It was done; and, with a mighty angel for his guide, the man stood ready for his infinite voyage, and from the terraces of heaven, without sound or farewell, at onco they wheeled away into endless spaco. Sometimes with the solemn flight of angel wing they fled through Zaarrahs of darkness, through wildernesses of death that divided th«s worlds of life : soirioviro.es. they swept o Vol' frontier*} that were quickening under prophetic motions towards life not yet exalted. Then, from a distance that is counted only in heaven, light dawned for a time through a sleepy film : by unutterable pace the light swept to thorn, they by unutterable pace to the light : in a moment the rushing of planets was upon them : in a moment the blazing of suns was around them. Then came eternities of twilight, that revealed, but were not revealed. To the right hand and to the left towerod mighty constellations, that by selfrepetitions and by answers from afar, that by counter-positions, that by mysterious- com-binations, built up triumphal gates, whoso architraves, whoso archways — horizontal, upiight rested, rose — at altitudes, by spans —that seemed ghostly from infinitude. Without measure were the architraves, past number were the archways, beyond memory the gates. _ Within wore stairs that scaled the eternities above, that descended to tho eternities below: above was below, below was above, to the man stripped of gravitating body: depth was swallowed up in height insurmountable, height was swallowed up m depth unfathomable. Suddenly as thoy rode from infinite to infinite, suddenly as thus they tilted over abysmal worlds, a mighty cry arose — that systems more mysterious, worlds more billowy— other heights and otber depths — were dawning were noaring, were at hand. Then the man sighed, stopped, shuddered, and wept. His overladen heart uttered itself in tears; 'and he said, - Angel, I will go no farther. Por ? t a°hes under this infinitv Insufferable is the glory of God's house. Let me lie, down m the grave, that I may find rest from the persecutions of the Infinite ; tor end, I see, there is none.' And from all the listening stars that shone around issued one choral chant— 'Even so it is: angel, thou knowest that it is : end there is none, that ever yet wo hoard of.* 'End is there none r the angel solemnly demanded. ' And is this the sorrow that kills ?' But no voico answeerd, that he might .answer himsolf. ihen the angel threw up his glorious hands to tne heaven of heavens, saying, 'End is ' there none to the universe of God?

                 In 1858-it miglht have been five years earlier or later, this is not history for the public schools-there was a little camp about ten miles from Pioche, occupied by upwards of three hundred miners, every one of wvhom might have packed his prospecting implements and left for more invit- ing fields any time before sunset. When the day was over, these men did not rest from their labors, like the honest New England agriculturist, but sang, danced, gambled, and shot each other. as the mood seized them.
                 One evening the report spread along the main street (whicli was the only street) that three men had been killed at Silver Reef, and that the bodies were coming in. Pres- ently a lumbering old conveyance labored up the hill, drawn by a couple of horses, well worn out witlh their pull. The cart contained a good-sized box, and no sooner did its outlines become visible through the glimmer of a stray light here and there, than it began to affect the idlers. Death always enforces respect, and even though no one had caught sight of the remains, the crowd gradually be- came subdued, and when the horses came to a stand-still, the cart was immediately surrounded. The driver, how- ever, was not in the least impressed with the solemnity of his commission.
                 "" All there ?"" asked one.
                 ""Haven't examined. Guess so.""
                 The driver filled his pipe and lit it as he continued:
                 ""Wish the bones and load had gone over the grade."" A man who had been looking on stepped up at once.
                 "" I don't know who you have in that box, but if they happen to be any friends of mine, I'll lay you alongside.""
                 "" We can mighty soon see,"" said the teamster, coolly. ""Just burst the lid off, and if they happen to be the men you want, I'm here.""
                 The two looked at each other for a moment, and the crowd gathered a little closer, anticipating trouble.
                 The teamster began to pry up the lid. He got a board off, and then pulled out some old rags. A strip of some- thing dark, like rosewood, presented itself.
                 "" Eastern coffins, by thunder! "" said several, and the crowd looked quite astonished.
                 Some more boards flew up, and the man who was ready to defend his friend's memory shifted his weapon a little. The cool manner of the teamster had so irritated him that he had made up his mind to pull his weapon at the first sight of the dead, even if the deceased was his worst and oldest enemy. Presently the whole of the box-cover was off, and the teamster, clearing atway the packing, revealed to the astonished group the top of something which puz- zled all alike.
                 "" Boys,"" said he, "" this is a pianner.""
                 A general shout of laughter went up, and the man who had been so anxious to enforce respect for the dead mut- tered something about feeling dry, and the keeper of the nearest bar was several ounces better off by the time the boys had given the joke all the attention it called for.
                 Had a dozen dead men been in the box, their presence in the camp could not have occasioned half the excitement that the arrival of that piano caused. ';By the next morn- ing it was known that the instrument was to grace a hurdy- gurdy saloon, owned by Tom Goskin, the leading gambler in the place. It took nearly a week to get this wonder on its legs, and the owner was the proudest individual in the

                 State. lt rose gradually from a recumbent to an upright position, amid a confusion of tongues, after the manner of the Tower of Babel.
                 Of course everybody knew just how such an instrument should be put up. One knew where the "" off h. ler should go, and another was posted on the "" front picr_
                 Scores of men came to the place every day to assist. ""I'll put the bones in good order.""
                 If you want the wires tuned up, I'm the boy."" ""I've got music to feed it for a month.""
                 Another brouglht a pair of blankets for a cover, and all took the liveliest interest in it. It was at last in a condi- tion for business.
                 "" It's been showin' its teeth all the week. We 'd like to have it spit out something.""
                 Alas ! there wasn't a man to be found who cot-id play upon the instrument. Goskin began to realize that he had a losing speculation on his hands. He had a fiddler, and d Mexican who thrummed a guitar. A pianist would have made his orchestra complete. One day a three-card monte player told a friend confidentially that he could "" knock any amount of music otit of the piano, if he only had it alone a few hours to get his hand in."" This report spread about the camp, but on being questioned hc vowed that he didn't know a note of music. It was noted, however, as a sus- picious circumstance, that he often hltng about the instru- ment, and looked upon it longingly, like a hungry man gloating over a beefsteak in a restaurant window. There was no doubt but that this man had music in his soul, per- haps in his fingers'-ends, but did not dare to make trial of hiis strength after the rules of harmony had suffered so many years of neglect. So the fiddler kept on with his jigs, and the greasy Mexican pawed his discordant gtuitar, but no man had the nerve to toucII that piano. There were, doubtless, scores of men in the camp who would have given ten ounces of gold-dust to have been half an hour alone with it, but every man's nerve shrank from the jeers which the crowd would shower upon him should his first attempt prove a failure. It got to be generally understood that the hand which first essayed to draw music from the keys must not slouch its work.

                 It was Christmas Eve, and Goskin, according to his cus- tom, had decorated his gambling hell with sprigs of moun- tain cedar and a shrub whose crimson berries did not seem a bad imitation of English holly. The piano was covered with evergreens, and all that was wanting to fill the cup. of Goskin's contentment was a man to play that piano.
                 "" Christmas night, and no piano-pounder,"" he said. ""This is a nice country for a Christian to live in.""
                 Getting a piece of paper, he scrawled the words
                 .... ... ... ..................
                 $20 Reward
                 To a compitant Pianer Player.
                 ...
                 This he stuck up on the music-rack, and, though the in- scription glared at the frequenters of the room until mid- night, it failed to draw any musician from his shell.
                 So the merry-making went on; the hilarity grew apace. Men danced and sang to the music of the squeaky fiddle and worn-out guitar, as the jolly crowd within tried to drown the howling of the storm without. Suddenly, they became aware of the presence of a white-haired man,
                 crouching near the fireplace. His garments-such as were left, were wet with melting snow, and he had a half- starved, half-crazed expression. He held his thin, trem- bling hands toward the fire, and the light of the blazing wood made them almost transparent. He looked about him once in a while, as if in search of sometlhing, and his presence cast suich a chill over the place that gradually the sound of the revelry was hutslhed, and it seemed that this waif of the storm had brought in with it all of the gloom and coldness of the warring elements. Goskin, mixing up a cup of hot egg-nogg, advanced and remarked cheerily:
                 "" Here, stranger, brace up ! This is the real stuff.""
                 'I'he man drained the cup, smacked his lips, and seemed more at home.
                 "" Been prospecting, hey ? Out in the mountains-caught in the storm ? Lively night, this !
                 "" Pretty bad,"" said the man. "" ALust feel pretty dry.""
                 The man looked at his streaming clothes and laughed, as if Goskin's remark was a sarcasm.
                 ""How long out ?"" ""Four days.""
                 ""llungry ? ""
                 'I'he man rose up, and walking over to the lunch coun- ter, fell to work upon some roast bear, devouring it like any wild animal would have done. As meat and drink and warmth began to permeate the stranger, he seemed to ex- pand and lighten up. His features lost their pallor, and he grew more and more content with the idea that he was not in the grave. As he underwent these changes, the people about him got merrier and happier, and threw off the feeling of depression whiclh he had laid upon them.
                 "" Do you always have your place decorated like this ?"" he finally asked of Goskin.
                 ""'l'his is Christmas Eve,"" was the reply. The stranger was startled.
                 ""December twenty-fourth, sure enough."" "" That's the way I put it up, pard.""
                 "" WI'hen I was in England I always kept Christmas. But- I had forgotten that this was the night. I've been wander- ing about in the mountains until I've lost track of the feasts of the Churclh.""
                 Presently his eye fell upon the piano. "" Where's the player? "" he asked.
                 "" Never had any,"" said Goskin, blushing "" I used to play when I was young.""
                 Goskin almost fainted at the admission.
                 "" Stranger, do tackle it and give us a tune ! Nary man in this camp ever had the nerve to wrestle with that music- box."" His pulse beat faster, for he feared that the man would, like all others, refuse him.
                 "" I'll do the best I can,"" he said.
                 There was no stool, but seizing a candle-box, he drew it up and seated himself before the instrument. It only required a few seconds for a hush to come over the room.
                 "" That old coon is going to give the thing a rattle.""
                 - The sight of a man at the piano was something so unu- sual that even the faro-dealer, who was about to take in a fifty-dollar bet on the tray, paused, and did not reach for the money. Men stopped drinking, with the glasses at their lips. Conversation appeared to have been struck with a sort of paralysis, and cards were no longer shuffled.
                 The old man brushed back his long, white locks, looked up to the ceiling, half closed his eyes, and in a mystic sort of reverie passed his fingers over the keys. He touched but a single note, yet the sound thrilled the room. It was the key to his improvisation, and as he wove his chords to- gether the music laid its spell upon every ear and heart.
                 He felt his way along the keys, like a man treading uncer- tain paths; but he gained confidence as he progressed, and presently bent to his work like a master. The instru- ment was not in exact tune, but the ears of his audience, through long disuse, did not detect anything radically wrong. They heard a succession of grand chords, a sug- gestion of melodies here and there, and it was enough.
                 ""See him counter with his left ! "" said an old rough.
                 ""He calls the tum every time on the upper end of the board,"" responded a man with a stack of chips in his hand.
                 The player wandered off into the old ballads they had heard at home. All the sad and melancholy, and touch- ing songs that came up like dreams of childhood, this un- known player drew from the keys. His hands kneaded their hearts like dough, and squeezed out the tears as from a wet sponge. As the strains flowed one upon the other, they saw their homes of the long ago reared again ; they were playing once more where the apple-blossoms sank through the soft air to join the violets on the green turf of the old New England States; they saw the glories of the Wisconsin maples and the haze of the Indian summer, blending their hues together ; they recalled the heather of Scottish hills, the white cliffs of Britain, and heard the sul- len roar of the sea, as it beat upon their memories vaguely. Then came all the old Christmas carols, such as they had sung in church thirty years before; the subtle music that brings up the glimmer of wax tapers, the solemn shrines, the evergreen, holly, mistletoe, and surpliced choirs. Then the remorseless performer planted his final stab in every heart with "" Home, Sweet Home.""
                 When the player ceased, the crowd slunk away from him. There was no more revelry and devilment left in his audi- ence. Each man wanted to sneak off to his cabin and write the old folks a letter. The day was breaking as the last man left the place, and the player, laying his head down on the piano, fell asleep.
                 ""I say, pard,"" said Goskin, ""you want a little rest ?""
                 ""I do feel tired,"" the old man said. "" Perhaps you'll let me rest here for the matter of a day or so.""
                 He walked behind the bar where some old blankets were lying and stretched himself upon them.
                 "" I feel pretty sick. I guess I won't last long. I've got a brother down in the ravine-his name's Driscoll. He don't know I'm here. Can you get him before moming?""
                 Goskin started. He knew Driscoll well.
                 ""He your brother? I'll have him here in half an hour."" As he dashed out into the storm the musician pressed his hand to his side and groaned. Goskin heard the word "" Hurry! "" and sped down the ravine to Driscoll's cabin. It was quite light in the room when the two men returned. Driscoll was pale as death.
                 "" My God ! I hope he's alive! I wronged him when we lived in England, twenty years ago.""
                 They saw the old man had drawn the blanket over his face. The two stood a moment, awed by the thought that he might be dead. Goskin lifted the blanket and pulled it down astonished. There was no one there!
                 ""Gone! "" cried Driscoll, wildly.
                 ""Gone!"" echoed Goskin, pulling out his cash-drawer. ""Ten thousand dollars in the sack, too.""
                 The next day the boys followed a horse's tracks through the snow, and lost them in the trail leading toward Pioche.
                 There was a man missing from the camp. It was the three-card monte man, who used to deny point-blank that he could play the scale. One day they found a wig of white hair, and called to mind when the ""stranger "" had pushed those locks back when he looked toward the ceiling for inspiration, on the night of December 24, i86i","poetry"

As soon as he came up, they accosted him with ' Your servant, Sir I' He replied, ' Your servant, gentlemen.' They asked him if he had not been preaching verymuch against drunkenness of late ? He answered in the affirmative. They then told him they had a favor to beg of him, and it was that he would preach a sermon to them , from a text they should choose. He argued that it was an imposition, for a man ought to have some consideration before preaching. They said they would not put up with a denial, and insisted upon his preaching immediately (in a hollow tree which stood by the road side) from the word MALT. He then began: ' Beloved, let me crave your attention. I am a little man-come at a short notice - to preach a short sermon - from a short text- to a thin congregation - in an unworthy pulpit.

But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away. But when the blade sprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.

from where I was born. I'm three thou

was the first music I ever heard."" I can
not help that. You are too near your
mother's rocking chair. ""Oh."" you say.
there can't be anything in that. That
chair has been vacant a great while."" I
cannot help that. It is all the mightier for
that. It is omnipotent, that vacant moth­
er's chair.- It whispers, it speaks, it weeps, it
carols, it mourns, it prays, it warns, it
thunders. A young man went off and
broke his mother's heart, and while he was
away from home his mother died, and t he
telegraph brought the son, and he came
into the room where she lay and looked
npon her ' face, and he cried out: ""Oh,
mother, mother, what your life could not
do your death shall effect! This moment I
give my heart to God."" And he kept his
promise. Another victory for the vacant
chair. With reference to your mother the
words of -my text were fulfilled, ""Thou
shalt be missed, because thy seat will be
empty.""
THE INVALID'S CHAIR.
I go on a little further, and I come to the
invalid's chair. What! How long have
you been sick? ""Oh! I have been sick ten,
twenty, thirty years."" Is it possible?
What a story of endurance. There are in
many of the families of my congregation
these invalids' chairs. The occupants oi
them thiuk they are doing no good in the
world, but that invalid's chair is the mighty
pulpit from which they have been preach­
ing, all these years, trust in God. The first
time I preached here at Lakeside, Ohio,
amid tbe throngs present, there was noth­
ing that so much impressed me as the spec­
tacle of just one face the face of an in­
valid who was wheeled in on her chair. I
said to her afterward. ""Madam, how long
have you been prostrated?"" for she was
lying flat in tbe chair. ""Oh!"" she replied,
""I have been this way fifteen years."" I said,
""Do you suffer very much?"" ""Oh, yes,""
she said, ""I suffer very much; I suffer all
the time; part of the time I was blind.
always suffer."" ""Well,"" I said, ""can you
keep yonr courage up?"" ""Oh, yes,"" she
said, ""lam happy, very happy indeed."" Her
face showed it. She looked the happiest of
any oue on the ground.
Oh, what a means of grace to tbe world,
these invalid chairs. On that field of hu­
man suffering the grace of God gets its
victory. Ldward Payson, the .invalid
and Richard Baxter, tbe invalid, and
Robert Hall, the invalid, and the ten thou
saDd of whom tbe world has never heard
but of whom all heaven is cognizant.- The
most conspicuous thing on earth for God's
eye and the eye of angels to rest on, is not
a throne of earthly power, but it is the in­
valid's chair. Oh, these men and women
who are always suffering but never com­
plaining these victims of spinal disease,

!:-'? OF HIS YOUTH.
Dr. Talinago Troachoa on tbe Benefits of
! Solitary Contemplation?The Hand of
Providence In the Vicissitudes of Ltfe.
i rrcparation For the Hereafter.
Brooklyn, Aug; C?Rev. Dr. Talmage
has chosen us the topic for today a pan?
orama of reminiscences appropriate to
the season, the text selected being Psalm
jxxxix, 8, ""Whilo I was musing the fire
burned.""
i
I Here is David, the psalmist, with the
forefinger of his right hand against his
[tempi o, tho door shut against the world,
Engaged in contemplation. And it would
(bo well for us to take tho same posture
often, closing tho door against the world
whilo wc sit down In sweet solitude to
contemplate.
In a small island off the coast I once
passed a Sabbath in delightful solitude,
for I had resolvod that I would have one
day of entire quiet before I entered upon
autumnal work. I thought to have spent
tho day in laying out plans for Christian
work, but instead of that it becamo a
day of tender reminiscence. I reviewed
my pastorate. I shook hands with an old
departed friend, whom I shall greet
again when the curtains of Hfo are lift?
ed. Tho days of my boyhood came back,
and I was 10 years of ago, and I was 8,
and I was ?. Thero was but one house
, on tho island, and yet from Sabbath day?
break, when the bird chant woke me,
until tho evening melted into the bay,
.from shoro to shore there were 10,000
? memories, and tho groves wcro o-hum
jwith voices that had long ago ceased.
youth and age.
I Youth is apt too much to spend all its
Itirao in looking forward.. Old age is apt­
loo much to spend all its timo In looking
backward. Pcoplo in midlife and on tho
apex look both ways. It would be well
for us, I think, however, to spend more
?mo in reminiscence. By the constitu?
tion of our naturo wo 6pend most of the
|ime' looking forward. And the vast
: majority of people live not so much in
Sie present as in tho future. I find that
you mean, to mako a reputation. Yon
mean to establish yourself, and the ad?
vantages that you expect to achieve ab?
sorb a great deal of your time. But I
see no harm in this if it does not make
ybh- discontented with the present or
: disqualify you for existing duties.
V: It is a u:.oful thing sometimes to look
bj?ck and to see tho dangers we have es?
caped, and to see. the sorrows we have
suffered, and tho trials and wandorings
of pur earthly pilgrimage, and to sum
up- our enjoyments. I mean today, so
far. as God may help me, to stir np your
? memory of tho past, so that in the re?
view you may be encouraged and hum?
bled, and urged to pray.
??Thero is a chapel in Florence with a
fre&amp;co by Guido, It was covered up
H;-iiK' two inches 6f stucco until our
American and European^ artists, .went
there and after long toil removed the
covering and retraced the fresco. And I
am aware that the memory of the past,
with many of you, Is all covered up with
10,000 obliterations, and I propose this
jmorning, so far as the Lord may help
me, to take away the covering, that the
jold picture may shine out again.
; I want to bind in one sheaf all your
past advantages, and I want to bind in
j another sheaf all your past adversities,
fit is a precious harvest, and I must be
(cautious how I swing the scythe.
1 Among tho greatest advantages of
your past life was an early home and its
surroundings. The bad men of the day,
for the most part, dip their heated pas­
jsions out of tho boiling spring of an un?
happy home. Wo are not surprised thai

city. ? It may have been in the days
Iwhen Canal street, New York, was far
tap town. That old house in the city
:may have been demolished or changed
linto stores, and it seemed liko sacrilege
Ito you, for thero was more meaning in
that plain house, in that small house,
than there is in a granite mansion or a

loved ones sat by the plain lamplight,
tho mother at the evening stand, tho
brothers and sisters, perhaps long ago
Igathercd into the skies, then plotting
[mischief on the floor or under the table;
your father with a firm voice command­
jing silence, that lasted half a rninute.
HAPrY CHILDHOOD day8.
Oh, those were good daysl If you had
your foot hurt, your mother always had
a soothing salve to heal it. If you were
wronged in tho street, your father was
always ready to protect you. The year
was one round of frolic and mirth. Your
greatest trouble was an April shower,
more sunshine than shower. The heart
had not been ransacked by troubles, nor
had sickness broken it, and no lamb had
a warmer sheepfold than the home in
which your childhood nestled,
j Perhaps you wore brought up in the
(country. You stand now today in mem­
pry under the old tree. You olnbbed it
pr fruit that was not quite ripe because
nrou could not wait any longer. You
pear the brook rumbling along over the
jpebblea. You step again into the furrow
Where your father in his ehirt sleeves
shouted to the lazy oxen. You frighten
the swallows from the rafters of the
barn and take just one egg and silence
your conscience by saying they will not
miss it You take a drink again out of
the very bucket that the old well fetched
up. 'You go for the cows at night and
find them wagging their heads through
the bars. Ofttimes in the dusty and busy
streets you wish you were home again on
that cool gross or in the hall of the fann­
iiouse, throuch which fchora &amp;>a
breath of new mown hay or the blossom
of buckwheat
You may have in your windows now
beautiful plants and flowers brought
from across the seas, but not one of them
Btirs in your soul so much charm and
memory as the old ivy and the yellow
sunflower that stood sentinel along the
garden walk and the f orgetmenots play?
ing, hide and seek mid the long grass.
The father, who used to come in sun?
burned from the fields and sit down on
the doorsill and wipe the sweat from
his hrnwjjnay have gone to his everlast

fog rest. Tho mother, who usedTositlit
the door a little bent over, cap and spec?
tacles on, her face mellowing with tho
vicissitudes of many years, may have
put down her gray head on the pillow in
the valley, but forget that home you
nevor will.
Have you thanked God tor it? Have
you rehearsed all these blessed reminis?
cences? Oh, thank God for a Christian
father. Thank God for a Christian
mother. Thank God for an early Chris?
tian altar at which yon were taught to
kneeL Thank God for an early Chris?
tian home.
I bring to mind another passage in the
history, of your life. The day came when
you set up your own household. The
days passed along in quiet blessedness.
You twain sat at thetable morning and
night and talked over your plans for the
future. The most insignificant affair in
your life became the subject of mutual
consultation and advisement You were
I so happy you felt you never could be any
happier.
OUT OP THE CLOUD.
One day a dark cloud hovered over
your dwelling, and it got darker and
darker. But out of that cloud the shin?
ing messenger of God descended to in?
carnate an immortal spirit. Two little
feet started on an eternal journey, and
you were to lead them. A gem to flash
in heaven's coronet, and you to polish it.
Eternal ages of light and darkness watch?
ing the starting out of a newly created
j being.
You rejoiced and you trembled at the
responsibility that in your possession an
immortal treasure was placed. You
prayed and-rejoiced, and wept and won?
dered, and prayed and rejoiced, and
wept and wondered. You wore earnest
in supplication that you might lead it
through life into the kingdom of God.
There was a tremor in your earnestness.
There was a double interest about that
home. There was an additional interest
why you should stay there and be faith?
ful, and when in a few months your
house was filled with the musio of the
child's laughter you were struck
through with the fact that you had a
stupendous mission. -
Have you kept that vow? Have you
neglected any of these duties? Is your
home as much to you as it used to be?
Have those anticipations been gratified? j
God help you today in your solemn rem?
iniscence and let his mercy' fall upon
your soul if your kindness has been !ll
requited I God have mercy on the"" par?
ent on the wrinkles of whose face is writ?
ten the story of a child's sin! God have
mercy on the mother-who in aCihdoo to
her other pangs has the pang of a child's
iniquity! Oh, there are many, many sad
sounds in, this sad world, but the saddest
sound that is over heard is the breaking
of a mother's heart! Are there anyJbere
who remember that,dn that home they
were unfaithful? Are there those who
wandered off from that early home and
loft the mother to die with a broken
heart? Oh, I stir that reminiscenco'to­
dayl
I find another point in your life his?
tory. You found one day you were in
the wrong road; you could not sleep at
night.. There was just .one word that
seelhed to sob through 'your' banldhg""
house, or through your office, or your
shop, or your bedroom, and that word
was ""eternity."" You said: ""I am not
ready for it 0 God, have mercy!"" The
Lord heard. Peace came to your heart.
You remember how your hand trembled1
as you took the cup of the holy com?
munion. You remember the old minis?
ter who consecrated it, and you remem- j
ber tho church officials who carried it
through the aisle. You remember the
old people who at the close of the service
took your hand in theirs in congratulat?
ing sympathy, as much as to say, ""Wel?
come home, you lost prodigal,"" and
though those hands have all withered
away that communion Sabbath is resur?
rected today. It is resurrected with all
its prayers and songs and tears and ser?
mons and transfiguration. Have you
kept those vows? Have you been a back?
slider? God help you! This day kneel
at the foot of mercy and start again for
heaven. Start today as you started then.
I rouse your soul by that reminiscence. 1
But I must not spend any more of my
time in going over the advantages of
your Hpo. I just put them all in one
great sheaf, and I bind them up in your
memory with- one loud harvest Song,
such as reapers sing. Praise the Lord,
ye blood bought mortals on earth I Praise
the Lord, ye crowned spirits of heavenl
TRIBULATIONS.
But some of you have not always had
a smooth life. Some of you are now in
the shadow. Others had their troubles
years ago; you are a mere wreck of what
you once were. I must gather up the'
sorrows of your past life, but how shall (
I do it? You say that is Impossible, as
you have had so many troubles and ad?
versities. Then I will just take two, the
first trouble and the last trouble.
As when you are walking along the
street and there has been music in the'
distance you unconsciously find your?
selves keeping 6tep to the music, so when,
you started life your very lifo was a mu?
sical timebeat. The air was full of joy
and hilarity. With the bright, clear oar,
you made tho boat skip. You went on,
and life grew brighter, until after
awhilo suddenly a voico from heaven
said, ""Haltr And you halted- You
grew pale. You confron ted yonr first sor?
row. You had no idea thut tho flush ou
your child's cheek was an unhealthy
flush. You Baid it cannot be anything
serious. Death in slippered feet walked
round about the cradle. You did not
hear the tread, but after awhile thetruth
flashed on you. You walked ibe floor.
band, have wrenched the child from the
destroyer!
You went to your room, and you said:
""God, save my child! God, save my
child f"" The world seemed going out in
darkness. You said, ""I cannot bear it,
I cannot bear it!"" You felt as if you
could not put the lashes over the bright
eyes never to see them again sparkle.
Oh, if yoii could have taken that little
one in your arms and with it leaped into
the grave, how gladly you would have
done itl Oh, if you could let your prop?
erty go, your houses, your land and your
storehouse go, how gladly you would
have allowed them to depart if you
could only haTve kept that one treasure!
But one day there arose from the
heavens a chill blast that swept over the
bedroom, and instantly all the light
went out, and there was darkness­
thick, mnrky, impenetrable, shuddering
darkness. But God did not leave you
there. Mercy spoke. As you were about
to put that cup to your lips God said,
""Let it pasSj"" and forthwith, as by the
hand .of angels, another cup was put into
your hands. It was the cup of God's |
consolation. And as _you have some­

times lifted tho beaoTof"" ? wounded sol­
dier and poured wine into bis lips, so
God puts bis left arm under your head,
and with his right hand he pours into
your Ups tho wine of his comfort ana
his consolation, and you looked at the
empty cradle and looked at your broken
heart, and you looked at the Lord's chas?
tisement, and you said, ""Even so, Fa?
ther, for so it seemeth good in thy
Bight""
Ah, it is your first trouble. How did
yon'get over it? God comforted yon.
You have been a better man ever since,
You have been a better woman ever
Binca In the jar of tho closing gate of
the sepulcher you heard the clanging of
the opening gat? of heaven, and you felt
an irresistible drawing heavenward.
You have been purer and holier of heart
ever since that night when the little one
for the last time put its arms around
your neck and said: ""Good night, papa.
Good night, mamma Meet me in heav?
en.""
But I must come on down to your later
sorrow. What was it? Perhaps it was
sickness. Tho child's tread on the stair
or tho tick of tho watch on the 6tand dis?
turbs you. Through the long, weary days
you counted the figures on the carpet or
tho flowers in the wall paper. Oh, the
weariness and exhaustion! Oh, the burn?
ing pangs 1 Would God it were morn?
ing, would God it were night, were your
frequent cry. But you are better?per?
haps even well. Have you thanked God
that today you can come out in the fresh
air; that you are in this place to hear
God's name, and to 6ing God's praise,­
and to implore God's help, and to ask
God's forgiveness? Bless the Lord who
healeth all our diseases and redeemeth
our lives from destruction.
Perhaps your last sorrow was a finan?
cial embarrassment. I congratulate
6ome of you on your lucrative profession
or occupation, on cruate apparel, on a
commodious residence?everything you
put your hand to seems to turn to gold
I But there are others of you vcho are like
j the ship on which Paul sailed where two
I 6eas met, and you are broken by the vio?
lence of the waves. By an unadvised
(indorsement, or by a conjunction of un?
foreseen events, or .by firo or storm, or a
I senseless panic, you have been flung
headlong, and where you once dispensed
great charities now you have hard work
to make the two ends meet

morning and that there shall be a shel?

there is air for your lungs and blood for
your heart and light for your eye and a
glad and glorious and triumphant reli?
gion for your soul?
Perhaps your last trouble was a be?
reavement. That heart which in child?
hood was your refuge, the parental
heart, and which has been a. Bource of
the quickest .sympathy^ ever since, has
suddenly become silent forever. And
now sometimes whenever in sudden an?
noyance and without deliberation you
say, ""I will go and tell mother,"" the
thought flashes on you. ""I have no moth?

your success without saying much, al?

Or there was your companion in life,

An Improved Wood Pavement,
The jarrah and the karri, two hard
woods native to Australia, are, being
largely used for paving carriage ways in
England, and especially in London,
where the heavy traffio is most taringto
the lasting qualities of pavements. The
whole breadth of the road is first cov?
ered with a layer of cement concrete in?
stead of sand 0 inches deep and arched
to the necessary convexity. On.the top
of this the wooden blocks are laid. The
slipperiness after showers which the
hardness of the wood entails is remedied
by a sprinkling of sand, and in dry weath?
er the horse shod with a flat shoe finds
as good footing as on other pavements.
The Australian woods are bound to
last four tin. s as long as the wood here?
tofore used. The first cost of paving a
street with these blocks in Melbourno
ranges from $3.16 per square yard for
karri to $3.40 for Jarrah; which does
not include the concrete or the cost of
excavation, laying and grouting.. If
transportation were cheap enough, the

Flowed Up a Meteor In California?
About a year ago a great meteor fell
at or near Table mountain. The fall of
the visitor from unknown spheres and
the consternation It caused among those
who were witnesses were told in a graphic
manner to a reporter of this paper by
Professor George H, Stout, superintend?
ent of schools, and created wide interest
Searching parties were organized, and
several scientific gentlemen came here to
get if possible a piece of the meteor. Mr.
Stout received letters from all over the
United States and even from Europe.
But despite strenuous efforts no trace of
the mysterious mass could be found.
The other day, however, Charles E.
Bloomfiel'd, who resides some miles to
the west of where this meteor was sup?
posed to have struck, discovered what is
undoubtedly a fragment of the same.
He was plowing his field when the im?
plement .krrne?Tupa mineral mass:wbjoh
?Mr. Blobmfield immediately recognised""
as not being of the ordinary character.
He brought the same to Orovflle, and it
is now on exhibition. The fragment
weighs CO pounds, is of a flint or brown?
ish color on tho surface, and for its eize
is remarkably heavy.?Oroville (Pa,)

The tender girl stood in pallid, though mute distress; not a sigh, not a tear escaped her. The idea of death broke so suddenly on her mind, that it checked every mode of utterance, and she gazed upon his countenance as if in a dream. '
                 Death, at any period of life, wears an awful aspect, but never more so than to the youthful heart, whose every step has been that of health and joy, and whose bounding pulse, yet swayed by hope, has never been chilled by the sorrows, or distracted by the -doubts 'and fears, that 'hang over our earthly existence. Thus it was with Emilie; united by the tenderest sympathy to her father, and living, as it were, in a world of music, no wonder that she beheld death with
                 terror, as the destroyer of her all-of happiness. The dying father raised himself on his couch-"" You spoke of refreshment, my daugh. ter; it can still be afforded to my fainting soul. Take these notes, the last that I shall ever pen, and sit down to the instrument. Sing with them the hymn so beloved by your mother, and let me once more hear those tones which have been my delight, my passion, since my earliest remembrance."" Emilie did as she was desired, and it seemed as if she sought a relief from her own thoughts; for after run- ning over a few chords of the piano, she commenced, in the sweetest voice, the following lines:
                 1 Spirit ! thy labor is o er,
                 Thy term of probation is run,
                 Thy steps are now bound for the untrodden shore,
                 And the race of immortals begun.
                 Spirit ! look not on the strife
                 Or the pleasure of earth with regret,-
                 Pause not on the threshold of limitless life,
                 To mourn for the day that is set. ""Spirit ! no fetters can bind,
                 No wicked have power to molest;
                 There the weary, like thee,-the wretched, shall find

                 As she concluded the last stanzas, she dwelt, for a few moments, on the low, melancholy notes of the piece, and :then waited in silence for the mild voice of her father s praises.

But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away. But when the blade sprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. And the servants of the master of the family came and said to him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? Whence then has it tares? And he said to
                 them, a man [that is] an enemy did this. And the servants said to him: Wilt thou then that we go and gather them? But he said, nay; lest in gathering the tares, you root up the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and at the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers: Gather first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my garner.""

But the tares are the children of the wicked one. The enemy also who sowed

As therefore the tares are gathered and burned with fire, so shall it be at the end of this age. The Son of Man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them who work iniquity; and shall cast them into the furnace of fire.

                 Drowsed over common joys and cares; -.
                 The earth was still, but knew not why;
                 The world was listening-unawares! Hlow calm a moment mav precede 0 -
                 One that shall thrill the world forever! To that still moment none would heed
                 Man's doom was linked, no more to sever,
                 In the solemn midnight,
                 Centuries ago!
                 It is the calm and solemn !
                 A thousand bells ring out, and show Their joyous peals abroad, and smite
                 The darkness-charmed and holy now ! The night that erst no shame had worn,
                 To it a happy name is given;

                 I should be a distinguished personage, and could not failto draw:
                 the melting glance of many a bony blue een upon mine own outward proportions.
                 Accordingly I passed up the natural avenue and came out upon the green. My feelings were very poetical as I walked slowly toward the door of the village. church. I entered. A popular preacher was holding forth, and the little meeting-house was much crowded. Several persons were standing up, and I soon discovered that I must also retain my perpendicular pos. ture, as every seat was crowded. 1, however,, pressed up :tbe aisle until I had gained a position where I could have a fair view of the faces of nearly all present. I soon. perceived that I was an object of attention. Many of the congregation looked euri. ously at ie, for I was a stranger to them all. In a few moments, however, the attention of every one present'dppeared to be ab. sorbed in the ambassador of grace, and I also began to take an interest in his discourse. The speaker was fluent, and many of his flights wers even sublime-but almost any thing was cal- culated to affect my mind then. The preacher spoke of Heaven and its joys, and the blissful. scenes with whiclh we were sur- rounded on every side. The music of tlie wood and the fragrance of the heath seemed to respond to his eloquence. Then it was no great stretch of the imagination to fancy that the white hand. ed creatures around me, with their pouting lips and artless in- nocence, were beings of a higher sphere. While my feelings were thus divided between the beauties and the blessings of the two worlds, and wrapt in a sort of poetical devotion, I detected one fair lass, with large black eyes, in stealing several glances at -me of a most animated character. I need not describe the sensations experienced by a youth when the eyes of a beautiful woman rest for any length of time on his countenance - and when he imagines himself to be an object of interest to her. I returned her glances with interest, and threw all the tenderness into my eyes which the scene, my meditations and the preacher's discourse had inspired inl my heart. I doubted not that this fair young damsel possessed kindred feelings with myself- that we were drinking together of the fountain of inspiration. How could it be otherwise ? She had been born and nurtured amid these wild and romantic scenes - and she was made up of ro- mance, of poetry, and tenderness. And then I thought of the purity of woman's love- her devotion-her truth. tinly prayed that I might meet with her where wve could enjoy a sweet interchange of sentiment. I thought of Sappho -and the ar- dent glanses of this young maiden reminded me of that creature of passionate affection. I thought of Werter and Charlotte, and could not doubt that the village maiden and myself were capable oL enjoying equal transport in each other's society. - tier glances continued-several times our cyps met. My heart ached with rapture. At length the benediction was pronounced. I lingered about the premises until I saw the dark-eyed damsel set out for home alone and on foot. ' 0 that the customs of so- ciety would permit- for we are surely one in soul.!' . Cruel formality that throws up a barrier between hearts made for each other ! ' Yet I determined to take the same path. I followed after her. She looked.belhind, and I thodglt she evinced some emotion at iecognising inc as the stranger of the day. I quick- ened my pace, and she actually slackened herd, as if to let me come up with her.
                 Noble young creature !' thought I. ' Her artless and' warm young heart is superior to the shackles of custom
                 I at length cause within a stone's throw her: She suddenly halted and turned her face toward me. My'heart swelled to bursting, and my cyes filled with tears of rapture and tenderness. I reached the spot where she stood. She began to speak, and I took off my hat as if doing reverence to an angel.
                 Are you a pedlar ? ' said she.
                 'No, my dear girl, that is not my occupation.'
                 '\Well, I do n't know,' continued she, not very bashfully, and eyeing me sternly, ' I thought when I saw you in the meeting- house that you looked like a pedlar who passed off a pewter half dollar on me, three weeks AF'go, and so I determined to keep my eye on you' BrotherJohn lias got liome, now- and lie says that if lie catches the fellow he will wring his neck for him -and I a' n't sure but you are the good for nothing rascal, after all,'

vast a realm. John went up on one moun­ B
tain of inspiration, and he looked off upon et
the multitude, and he said: ""Thousands tu
of thousands."" Then he came upon a
greater altitude of inspiration and looked h
off upon it again and he said: ""Ten thou­ h
sand times ten thousand."" And then he w
came on a higher mount of inspiration, it
and looked off again and he said: ""A re
hundred and forty and four thousand a
and thousands of thousands."" And he p
came on a still greater height of inspira­ h
tion, and he looked off again and -ex­ d
claimed: ""A great multitude that no man fi
can number."" -
Now I ask, how are you going to find d
your friends in such a throng as that? Is ,
not this idea we have been entertaining b
after all a falsity? Is this doctrine of a
future recognition of friends in heaven a
guess, a myth, a whim, or is it a granitic
foundation upon which the soul pierced of b
all ages may build a glorious hope? In­ J
tense question. Every heart in this audi­ j
ence throbs right into it. There is in
every soul here the tomb of at least one y
dead. Tremendous question. It makes
it the lip quiver, and the cheek flush, and
te the entire nature thrill. Shall we know
each other there? I get letters almost
c. every month asking me to discuss this f
c. subject. I get a letter in a bold, scholarly r
c. hand, on gilt edged paper, asking me to i
discuss this question, and I say, ""Ah, that t
is a curious man, and he wants a curious i
question solved."" But I get another'letter. e
It is written with a trembling hand, and
on what seems to be a torn out leaf of a
book, and here and there is the mark of a ]
tear, and I say: ""Oh, that is a broken
heart, and it wants to be comforted.""
POSITIVE CERTAINTY.
ci The object of this sermon is to take t his
is theory out of the region of surmise and t
speculation into the region of positive f
certainty. People say: ""It would be very
pleasant if that doctrine were true. I
i0 hope it may be true. Perhaps it is true. I
0 wish it were true."" But I believe that I 1
o can bring an accumulation of argument to
'o bear upon this matter which will prove I
is the doctrine of future recognition as
n plainly as that there is any heaven at all,
on and that the kiss of reunion at the celes­
lo tial gate will be as certain as the dying
kiss at the door of the sepulcher.
s Now, when you are going to build a ship
you must get the right kind of timber.
You lay the keel and make the framework
of the very best materials, the keelson,
is stanchions, plank shear, counter timber­
knee, transoms all of solid oak. You may
build a ship of lighter material, but when
10 the cyclone comes on it will go down.
Now we may have a great many beautiful
theories about the future world, built out of
our own fancy, and they may do very well
+p
as long as we have smooth sailing in the
let world, but when the storms of sorrow
come upon us, and the hurricane of death,
we will be swamped-we will be foundered.
We want a theory built out of the solid oak
of God's eternal Word. The doctrine of
futufre recognition is not so often positively
, stated in the Word of God as implied, and
you know, my friends, that that is, after all,
the strongest mode of affirmation. Your
eo friend travels in foreign lands. He comes
Shome. He does not begin by arguingwith
you to prove that there are such places as
London and Stockholm and Paris and
Dresden and Berlin, but his conversation
o implies it. And so this Bible does not so
positively state this theory as, all up and
La. down, its chapters take it for granted.
""I SHALL GO TO HIR.""
What does my text imply? ""I shall go
re to him."" What consolation would it be
eto David to go to his child if he would not
o% know him? Would David have been al­
lowed to record this anticipation for the
rs inspection of all ages if it wen? a ground­
in less anticipation? We read in the first
for book of the Bible, Abraham died and was
gathered to his people. Jacob died and
was gathered to his people. Moses died
and was gathered to his people. What
people? Why, their friends, their com­
rades, their old companions. Of course it
means that. It cannot mean anything
else. So the very beginning of the
Bible four times that is taken for granted.
The whole New Testament is an arbor,
o'er which this doctrine creeps like a lux­
urias vine full of the purple clusters of
consolation. James, John and Peter fol­
a lowed Christ into the mountain. A light
a falls from heaven on that mountain and
lifts it into the glories of the -celestial.
Christ's garments glow and his face shines
like the sun. The door of heaven swings
open. Two spirits come down and alight
on that mountain. The disciples look at
them and recognize them as Moses and
Elias. Now, if those disciples standing on
the earth could recognize these two spirits
- who had been for years in heaven, do you
tell me that we, with our heavenly eye­
iCEi sight, will not be able to recognize those
w­ ho have gone out from among us only
ess five, ten, twenty, thirty years ago?
- The Bible indicates over and over again
Sthatthat the angels know each other, and then
IL. the Bible says that we are to be higher than
the angels; and if the angels have the power
on of recognition shall not we, who are to be
higher than they in the next realm, have
as good eyesight and as good capacity?
What did Christ mea in his conversation with Mary and Martha when he aid, ""Thy eon
brother shall rise again?"" It was as much free
as to say, ""Don't cry. Don't wear your­ say
selves out with this trouble. You will see le
him again. Thy brother shall rise again."" the
A GREAT DOMaE CIBCL­ C sid
The Bible describes heaven as a great
home circle. Well, now, that would be a
very queer home circle where the members
did not know each other. The Bible de­
scribes death as a sleep. If we know each '
other before we go to sleep shall we not
kh know each other after we wake up? Oh.
yes. We will knoweachothera great deal per
better then than now; ""for now,"" says the ast
apostle, ""we see through a glass darkly,
but then face to face."" It will be my puri­ an
fled, enthroned and glorified body gazing hal
on your purified, enthroned and glorified
body.
Now I demand, if you believe the Bible, the
that you take this theory of future recog­ oft
nition out of the realm of speculation and
surmise into the region of positive certain­ s
ty, and no more keep sayingi ""I hope it is t
so, I have an idea it is so, I guess it is so."" eve
Be able to say, with all the concentrated a'c
'energy of body, mind and soul,.'""I know it op
is so.""' th
There are in addition to these Bible ar
guments other reasons why I accept this
theory. In the first place because the re­
jection of it implies the entire obliteration
of our memory. Can it be possible that we na
shall forget forever those with whose walk, b
look,manner we have been so long familiar?
Will death come, and with a sharp, keen tie
blade hew away this faculty of memory?
Abraham said to Dives, ""Son, remember.""
If the exiled and the lost remember will
not the enthroned remember? be
VICTOR BESIDE VICTOR. o
You know very well that our joy in any ar
circumstance is augmented by the compan­ aw
ionship of our friends. We cannot see a
picture with less than four eyes or hear a
song with less than four ears. We want I1l
some one beside us with whom to exchange lo1
glances and sympathies, and I suppose the a""
joy of heaven is to be augmented by the th
fact that we are to have our friends with us
when there rise before us the thrones of
the blessed, and when there surges up in
our ears the jubilate of thesaved. Heaven m
is not a contraction; it is an expansion. If mn
I know you here I will know you better
there. Here Isee you with only two eyes, WE
but there the soul shall have a million
eyes. It will be immortality gazing on he
immortality, ransomed spirit in colloquy be
with ransomed spirit, victor beside victor.
When John Evans, the Scotch minister, t
was seated in his study his wife came in
and said to him, ""My dear, do you think la
we will know each other in heaven?"" He t
turned to her and said, ""My dear, do you or
think we will be bigger fools in heaven g
than we are here?"" ae
Again I accept this doctrine of future
recognition because the world's expectancy
affirms it. In all lands and ages this the­
ory is received. What form of religion
h
planted it? No form of religion, for it is
received under all forms of religion. Then,
I argue, a sentiment, a feeling, an antici­ 01
pation, universally planted, must have se
been God implanted, and if God implanted P
it is rightfully implanted. Socrates writes: a
""Who would not part with a great deal to
purchase a meeting with Orpheus and t
Homer? If it be true that this is to be the d
consequence of death I could even be able
a
to die often.""
a Among the Danes, when a master dies II
1 his servant sometimes slays himself that
he may serve the master in the future
world. Cicero, living before Christ's com­
ing, said: ""Oh, glorious day when I shall
retire from this low and sordid scene to
1 associate with the divine assemblage of de­
e parted spirits, and not only with the one I v
have just now mentioned, but with my y
dear Cato, the best of sons and most faith­ '
a ful of men. If I seemed to bear his death n
with fortitude it was by no means that I G
d did not most sensibly feel the loss I had
sustained. It was becauselwas supported v
g by the consoling reflection that we could n
f not long be separated."" a ALL BELIEVE IT.
0 The Norwegian believes it. The Indian
f believes it. The Greenlander believes it.
I­ The Swiss believes it. The Turk believes it.
- Under every sky, by every river, in every
n zone, the theory is adopted, and so I say a
13 principle universally implanted must be
's God implanten, and hence a right belief. b
d The argument is irresistible.
V Again I adopt this theory because there
it are features of moral temperament and t
9 features of the soul that will distinguish g
y us forever. How do we know each other 1
: in this world? Is it merely by the color of i
st the eye, or the length of the hair, or the 6
1s facial proportions? Oh, no. It is by the
r. disposition as well, by natural affinity,
id using the word in the very best sense and
a not in the bad sense; and if in the dust our
a body should perish and lie there forever,
:n and there should be no resurrection, still'
the soul has enough features and the dis­ r
position has enough features to make us
is distinguishable. I can understand how in
Id sickness a man will become so delirious
,e that he will not know his own friends; but
ry will we be blasted with such insufferable
i idiocy that, standing beside our best friends
I for all eternity, we will never guess who
I they are?
to Again I think that one reason why we
re ought to accept this doctrine is because we
as never in this world have an opportunity to
11, give thanks to those to whom we are spir­
i­ itually indebted. The joy of heaven, we
*g are told, is to be inaugurated by a review
of life's work. These Christian men and
ip women who have been toiling for Christ,
r. have they seen the full result of their worki
rk Oh, no.
n, In the church at Somerville, N. J., John
r­ Vredenburgh preached for a great many
y years. He felt that his ministry was a fail­
n ure, although he was a faithful minister,
n. preaching the gospel all the time. Hlie died,
i and died amid discouragements, and went
of home to God; for no one ever doubted that
1l John Vredenburgh was a good Christian
be minister. A little while after his death
v there came a great awakening in Somer­
h, ville, and one Sabbath two hundred souls
v. stood up at the Christian altar espousing
ak the ceuse of Christ, among them my own
of father end mother. And what was pecu­
d liar in regard to nearly all of those two
n hundred souls was that they dated their
il, religious impressions from the ministry of
r John Vredenburgh. Will that good Chris­
ith meetthose soulsbroughttoChristthrough
as his instrumentality? Oh, of course he will
nd know them. I remember one Sabbath
.0n afternoon, borne down with the sense of
so my sins and knowing not God, I took up
nd Doddridge's ""Rise and Progress."" Oh,
what a dark afternoon it was, and I read
the chapters, and I read the prayers, and I
go tried to make the prayers my own. Oh, I
be must see Philip Doddridge. A glorious

al­ now.

ad­ There is a mother before the throne of

Ld Cannot there be? Her son was awanderer

at good mother died. He broke her old

eit ness of sin. She is before the throne of
ing God now. Years pass and that son repents
the of his crimes and gives his heart to God
ed. and becomes a useful Christian, and dies
or, and enters the gates of heaven. -You tell

tat Abeel? When India -omes will it not
and know Dr. John Scudder? When the In­
on dians come to God will they not know Da­
rits vid Brainard?
ou­ I see a soul entering heaven at last, with
vye­ covered face at the idea that it has done so
lose little for Christ and feeling borne down
ily with unworthiness, and it says to itself, ""I
have no right to be here."" A voice from
ain the throne says,. ""Oh, you forget that Sun­

han one of them."" And another volce says,
wer ""You forget that poor man to whom you
o be gave a loaf of bread and told of the heaven­

I fear be uttered, the cry for bread.
I pray God that the contrast between
our prosperity and their want may not
be as sharp as in the lands referred to
by my text. There was nothing to eat.
Plenty of corn in Egypt, but ghastly
famine in Canaan. The cattle moan­
ing in the stall. Men, women and
children awfully white with hunger,
ot the failing of one crop for one
summer, but the failing of all the crops
for seven years. A nation dying for
lack of that which is so common on
your table, and so little appreciated;
the product of harvest field and grist
mill and oven ; the price of sweat and
aniiety and struggle bread! Jacob
the father has the last report from the
flour bin, and he finds that everything
is out, and he says to his-sons, ""Boys,
hook up the wagons and start for Egypt
and get something to eat.""
The fact was, there was a great corn­
crib in Egypt. The people of Egypt
have been largely taxed in all ages, at
the present time paying between 70 and
80 per cent, of their products to the
government. o wonder in that time
they had a large corncrib and it was
full. To that crib they came from the
regions round about those who were
famished some paying for corn in
money; when the money was exhaust­
ed, paying for the corn in sheep and
cattle, and horses and camels; and
when they were exhausted, then sell­
ing their own bodies and their fam­
ilies into slavery.
THK JOUKXEY TO KGYPT.
The morning for starting out on the
crusade for bread has arrived. Jacob
gets his family up very early. But be­
fore the elder sons start they say some­
thing that makes him tremble with
emotion from head to foot and burst
into tears. The fact was that these
elder sons had once before been in
Egypt to get corn, and they had been
treated somewhat roughly, the lord of
the corncrib supplying them with corn,
but saying at the close of the inter­
view, ""Now, you need not come back
here for any more corn unless you
bring something better than money
even your younger brother Benjamin.""
Ah! Benjamin that very name was
suggestive of all tenderness. The
mother had died at the birth of that
son a spirit coming and another spirit
going and the verjr thought of part­
ing with Benjamin must have been a
heart break. The keeper of this corn­
crib, nevertheless, says to these older
sons, ""There is no need of your com­
ing here any more for corn unless you
bring Benjamin, your father's darling.""
Now Jacob and his family very much
needed bread ; but what a struggle it
would be to give up this son.
The orientals are very demonstrative
in their grief, and I hear the outwailing
of the father as these older sons keep
reiterating in his ears the announce­
ment of the Egyptian lord, ""Ye shall
not see my face unless your brother be
with you."" ""Why did you tell them
you had a brother?"" said the old man,
complaining and chiding them. ""Why,
father,"" they said, ""he asked us all
about our family, and we had no idea
he would make any such demand upon
us as he has made."" ""2so use of ask­
ing me,"" said the father, ""I cannot, I
will not give up Benjamin.""
The fact was that the old man had
lost children ; and when there has been
bereavement in a household, and a
child taken, it makes the other children
in the household more precious. So
the day for departure was adjourned
and adjourned and adjourned. Still
the horrors of the famine increased, and
louder moaned the cattle, and wider
open cracked the earth, and more pal­
lid became the cheeks, until Jacob, in
despair, cried out to his sons, ""Take
Benjamin and be olf."" The older sons
tried to cheer up their father. They
said: ""We have strong arms and a
stout heart, and no harm will come to
Benjamin. We'll see that he gets back
again."" ""Farewell!"" said the young
men to the father, in a tone of assumed
good cheer. ""F-a-r-e-w-e-1-1 !"" said the
old man ; for that word has more quav­
ers in it when pronounced by the aged
than by the young.
THK DEMAND FOK BEJCJAMLSf.
Well, the bread party the bread em­
bassy drives up in front of the corn­
crib of Egypt. These corncribs are
fil'ed with wheat, barley and corn in
the husk, for those who have traveled
in Canaan and ?"".gypt know that there
is corn there corresponding with our
Indian maize. Huzza! the journey is
ended. The lord of the corncrib, who
is also the prime minister, comes down
to these arrived travelers and says:
""Dine with me today. How is your
father? Is this Benjamin, the younger
brother whose presence I demanded?""
The traveler are introduced into the
palace. They are worn and bedusted
of the way; and servants come in with
a basin of water in one hand and a
towel in the other, and kneel down be­
fore these newly arrived travelers, wash­
ing off the dust of the way. The
butchers and poulterers and caterers of
the prime minister prepare the repast.
The guests are seated in small groups,
two or three at a table, the food on a
tray; all the luxuries from imperial
gardens and orchards and aquariums
and aviaries are brought there and are
filling chalice and platter.
Now is the time for this prime min­
ister, if he has a grudge against Benja­
min, to show it. Will he kill him, now
that he has him in his hands? Oh, no!
: This lord of the corncrib is seated at
! his own table, and he looks over to the
table of his guests, and he sends a por­
! tion to each of them, but sends a larger
' portion to Benjamin, or, as the Bible
I quaintly puts it, ""Benjamin's mess was
; five times so much as any of theirs.""
; Be quick and send word back with the
; swiftest camel to Canaan to old Jaeob
! that ""Benjamin is well ; all is well; he is
faring sumptuously; the Egyptian lord
: did not mean murder and death, but
he meant deliverance and life when he
announced to us on that day, 'Ye shall
not see my face unless your brother be
with you.' ""
THIS WOULD CXDEK A CCKSK.
Well, my friends, this world is fam­
ine struck of sin. It does not yield a
single crop of solid satisfaction. It is
dying. It is hunger bitten. The fact
that it does not, cannot, feed a man's
heart was well illustrated in the life of
the English comedian. All the world
honored him did everything for him

that the world could do. He was ap­
plauded in England and applauded in
the United States. lie roused up na­
tions into laughter. He had no equal.
And yet, although many people sup­
posed him entirely happy, and that this
world was completely satiating his soul,
he sits down and writes: ""I never in
my life put on a new hat that it did
not rain and ruin it. I never went out
in a shabby coat because it was rain­
ing and thought all who had theehoice
would keep indoors that the sun did
not burst forth in its strength and bring
out with it all the butterflies of fashion
whom I knew and who knew me. I
never consented to accept a part I
hated, out of kindness to another, that
I did not get hissed by the public and
cut by the writer. I could not take a
drive for a few minutes with Terry with­
out being overturned and having my el­
bow bone broken, though my friend got
off unharmed. I could not make a cov­
enant with Arnold, which I thought was
to make my fortune without making his
instead, than in an incredible space of
time 1 think thirteen months I
earned for him twenty thousand
pounds and for myself one. I am per­
suaded that if I were to set up as a
beggar every one in my neighborhood
would leave off eating bread."" That
was the lament of the world's comedian
and joker. All unhappy.
The world did everything for Lord
Byron that it could do, and yet in his
last moment he asks a friend to come
and sit down by him and read, as most
appropriate to his case, the story of
""The Bleeding Heart."" Torrigiano,
the sculptor, executed, after months of
care and carving, ""Madonna and the
Child."" The royal family came in and
admired it. Everybody that looked at
it was in ecstacy, but one day, after all
that toil, and all that admiration, be­
cause he did not get as much compen­
sation for his work as he had expected,
he took a mallet and dashed the ex­
quisite sculpture into atoms. The world
is poor compensation, poor satisfaction,
poor solace. Famine, famine, in all
the earth ; not for seven years, but for
six thousand.
But, blessed be God there is a great
corncrib. The Lord built it. It is in
another land. It is a large place. An
angel once measured it, and as far as I
can calculate it in our phrase, that corn­
crib is fifteen hundred miles long and
fifteen hundred broad and fifteen hun­
dred high ; and it is full. Food for all
nations. ""Oh!"" say the people, ""we
will start right away and get this sup­
ply for our soul."" But stop a moment ;
for from the keeper of that corncrib
there comes this word, saying, ""You
shall not see my face except your broth­
er be with you.""
In other words, there is no such thing
as getting from heaven pardon and
comfort and eternal life, unless we
bring with us our divine brother, the
Lord Jesus Christ. Coming without
him we shall fall before we reach the
corncrib, and our bodies shall be a por­
tion for the jackals of the wilderness,
but coming with the Divine Jesus, all
the granaries of heaven will swing open
before our soul, and abundance shall
be given us. We shall be invited to sit
in the palace of the king and at the
table, and while the Lord of heaven is
apportioning from his own table to
other tables he will not forget us, and
then and there it will be found that our
Benjamin's mess is larger than all the
others, for so it ought to be. ""Worthy
is the lamb that was slain, to receive
blessing and riches and honor and
glory and power.""
WHEN WILL YOU REFORM?
I want to make three points. Every
frank and common sense man will ac­
knowledge himself to be a sinner.
What are you going to do with your
sins? Have them pardoned, you say.
How? Through the mercy of God.
What do you mean by the mercy of
God? Is it the letting down of a bar
for the admission of all, without re­
spect to character? Be not deceived!
I see a soul coming up to the gate of
mercy and knocking at the corncrib of
heavenly supply. And a voice from
within says, ""Are you alone?"" The
sinner replies, ""All alone."" The voice
from within says, ""You shall not see
tny pardoning face unless your Divine
Brother, the Lord Jesus, be with you.""
Oh, that is the point at which so many
are discomforted. There is no mercy
from God except through Jesus Christ.
Coming with him we are accepted.
Coming without him we are rejected.
Peter put it right in his great sermon
before the high priests, when he thun­
dered forth: ""Neither is there salva­
tion in any other. There is no other
name given under heaven among men
whereby we may be saved."" O anx­
ious sinner! O dying sinner! O lost
sinner! all you have got to do is to
have this Divine Benjamin along with
you. Side by side, coming to the gate,
all the storehouses of heaven will
swing open before your anxious soul.
Am I right in calling Jesus Benjamin?
Oh, yes. Rachel lived only long enough
to give a name to that child, and with
a dying kiss she called him Benoni.
Afterward Jacob changed his name,
and he called him Benjamin. The
meaning of the name she gave was
""Son of my Pain."" The meaning of
the name the father gave was ""Son of
my Right Hand. "" And was not Christ
the son of pain! All the sorrows of
Rachel in that hour, when she gave her
child over into the hands of strangers
was nothing compared with the strug­
gle of God when he gave up his only
Son. The omnipotent God in a birth
throe ! And was not Christ appropri­
ately called ""Son of the Right Hand!""
Did not Stephen look into heaven
and see him standing at the right hand
of God ? And does not Paul speak of
him as standing at the right hand of
God making intercession for us? O
Benjamin Jesus ! Son of pang. Son
of victory! The deepest emotions of
our souls ought to be stirred at the
sound of that nomenclature. In your
prayers plead his tears, his sufferings,
his sorrows and his death. If you re­
fuse to do it, all the corncribs and the
palaces of heaven will be bolted and
barred against your soul, and a voice
from the throne shall stun you with the
announcement, ""You shall not see my
face except your brother be with you.""
KO SOLACE TN"" THIS ""WORLD.
My text also suggests the reason why
so many people do not get any real
comfort. You meet ten people, nine
of them are in need of some kind of
condolence. There is something in
their health, or in their state, or in
their domestic condition, that demands
sympathy. And yet the most of the
world's sympathy amounts to abso­
lutely nothing. People go to the wrong
crib, or they go in the wrong way.
When the plague was in Rome a great
many years ago there were eighty men
who chanted themselves to death with
the litanies of Gregory the Great lit­
erally chanted themselves to death,
and yet it did not stop the plague. And
all the music of the world cannot halt
the plague of the human heart.
I come to some one whose ailments
are chronic, and I say, ""In heaven you
will never be sick."" That does not
give you much comfort. What you
want is a soothing power for your pres­
ent distress. Lost children, have you?
I come to tell you that in ten years per­
haps you will meet these loved ones be­
fore the throne of God. But there is
but little condolence in that. One day
is a year without them, and ten years
is a small eternity. What you want is
a sympathy now present help. I
come to those of you who have lost
dear friends, and sayr: ""Try to forget
them. Do not keep the departed al­
ways in your mind."" How can you
forget them when every figxire in the

carpet, and every booK, aiide very pic­
ture and every room calls out their
name.
Suppose I come to you and say by
way of condolence, ""God is wise.""
""Oh,"" you say, ""that gives me no
help."" Suppose I come to you and say,
""God, from all eternity; has arranged
this trouble."" ""Ah!"" you say, ""that does
me no good."" Then I say, ""With the
swift feet of prayer go direct to the corn­
crib for a heavenly supply."" You go.
You say, ""Lord, help me; Lord, comfort
me."" But no help yet. No comfort
yet. It is all dark. What is the mat­
ter? I have found. You ought to go
to God and say: ""Here, O Lord, are
the wounds of my soul, and I bring
with me the wounded Jesus. Let his
wounds pay for my wounds, his be­
reavements for my bereavements, his
loneliness for my loneliness, his heart
break for my heart break. O God ! for
the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ the
God, the man, the Benjamin, the broth­
er deliver my agonized soul. O Jesus
of the weary foot, ease my fatigue. O
Jesus of the aching head, heal my ach­
mg head. O Jesus of the Bethany sis­
ters, roll away the stone from the door
of our grave. ""
THE FERVENT, EFFECTUAL PRAYER.
That is the kind of prayer that brings
help; and yet how many of you are
getting no help at all, for the reason
that there is in your soul, perhaps, a
secret trouble. You may never have
mentioned it to a single human ear, or
you may have mentioned it to some
one who is now gone away, and that
great sorrow is still in your soul. After
Washington Irving was dead, they
found a little box that contained a
braid of hair and a miniature, and the
name of Matilda Hoffman, and a
memorandum of her death, and a re­
mark something like this: ""The world
after that was a blank to me. I went
into the country, but found no
peace in solitude. I tried to go into
society, but I found no peace in socie­
ty. There has been a horror hanging
over me by night and by day, and I
am afraid to be alone.""
How many unuttered troubles! No
human ear has ever heard the sorrow.
0 troubled soul, I Avant to tell you that
there is one salve that can cure the
wounds of the heart, and that is the
talve made out of the tears of a sym­
pathetic Jesus. And yet some of you
Will not take this solace ; and you try
chloral and you try morphine and you
try strong drink and you try change of
scene and you try new business associa­
tions and everything and anything ra­
ther than take the divine companion­
ship and sympathy suggested by the
words of my text when it says, ""You
shall not see my face again unless your
brother be with you."" Oh, that you
might understand something of the
height and depth and length and
breadth and immensity and infinity of
God's eternal consolations.
I go further and find in my subject
a hint as to the way heaven opens to
the departing spirit. We are told that
heaven has twelve gates, and some
people infer from that fact that all the
people will go in without reference to
their past life. But what is the use of
having a gate that is not sometimes to
be shut? The swinging of a gate im­
plies that our entrance into heaven is
conditional. It is not a monetary con­
dition. If we come to the door of an
exquisite concert we are not surprised
that we must pay a fee, for we know
that fine earthly music is expensive;
but all the oratorios of heaven cost
nothing.
Heaven pays nothing for its music.
It is all free. There is nothing to be
paid at that door for entrance, but the
condition of getting into heaven is our
bringing our divine Benjamin along
with us. Do you notice how often
dying people call upon Jesus? It is the
usual prayer offered the prayer offered
more than all the other prayers put to­
gether ""Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.""
One of our congregation, when asked
in the closing moments of his life, ""Do
you know us?"" said: ""Oh, yes, I know
you. God bless you. Goodbyr. Lord
Jesus, receive my spirit,"" and he was
gone. Oh, yes, in the closing moments
of our life we must have a Christ to
call upon.
NO SALVATION OUT OF CHRIST.
If Jacob's sons had gone toward
Egypt, and had gone with the very
finest equipage, and had not taken Ben­
jamin along with them, and to the
question they should have been obliged
to answer, ""Sir, we didn't bring him,
as father could not let him go; we
didn't want to be bothered with him,""
a voice from within would have said :
""Go away from us. You shall not have
any of this supply. You shall not see
my face because your brother is not
with you."" And if we come up toward
the door of heaven at last, though we
come from all luxuriance and bril­
liancy of surroundings, and knock for
admittance, and it is found that Christ
is not with us, the police of heaven will
""beat us back from the breadhouse,
saying, ""Depart, I never knew you.""
If Jacob's sons, coming toward Egypt,
had lost everything on the way ; if they
had expended their last shekel ; if they
had come up utterly exhausted to the
corncribs of Egypt, and it had been
found that Benjamin was with them,
all the storehouses would have swung
open before them. And so, though by
fatal casualty we may be ushered into
the eternal world ; though we may be
weak and exhausted by protracted
sickness if, in that last moment, we
can only just stagger and faint and fall
into the gate of heaven it seems
that all the corncribs of heaven
will open for our need and all the
palaces will open for our reception;
and the Lord of that place, seated
at his table, and all the angels of
God seated at their table, and the
martyrs seated at their table, and
all our glorified kindred seated at our
table, the king shall pass a portion from
his table to ours, and then, while we
think of the fact that it was Jesus who
started us on the road, and Jesus who
kept us on the way, and Jesus who at
last gained admittance for our soul, we
shall be glad if he has seen of the trav­
ail of his soul and been satisfied, and
not be at all jealous if it be found that
our divine Benjamin's mess is five times
larger than all the rest. Hail I anointed
of the Lord. Thou art worthy.
My friends, you see it is either Christ
or famine. If there Avere two banquets
spread, and to one of them only you
might go, you might stand and think
for a good while as to which invitation
you had better accept; but here it is
feasting or starvation. If it were a
choice between oratorios you might
say, ""I prefer the 'Creation'"" or ""I
prefer the 'Messiah.' "" But here it is a
choice between eternal harmony and
everlasting discord. Oh, will you live
r die ? Will you start for the Egyptian
corncrib or will you perish amid the
empty barns of the Canaanitish fam­
ine? ""Ye shall not see my face except
your brother be with you.""

A COUPLE OF PRACTICAL JOKERS.

And How They Put Up n. Job on One of
Their Friends with a Short Memory.
""Hello, old man! By George. Tin
glad to see you. Harold! Where have
you been all these years?""
The speaker was a well dressed young
fellow with the air of a man .about
town, the other had a far away look in
his eyes and seemed to be a dreamer.
Both were in evening dress, coining
out of u Broadway theater between
the acts.
""Well, really, sir,"" answered gentle­
man No. 2 with dignity, ""you have the
better of me; I seem to remember your
face, but somehow I cannot place you.""
""AVhat, you don't remember me five
years ago when we both belonged to
the Scribblers' club? You don't remem­
ber those games of pool wiien you al­
ways got stuck?""
""I certainly did belong to the Scrib­
blers' club and used to get stuck there
at pool do yet for that matter but I
don't remember you.""
Gentleman No. 1 laughed, but pro­
vokingly and persistently refused to
disclose his identity.
No. 1 kept up a rattling fire of remin­
iscence, telling his friend so much about
his (No. 2's) past life, mentioning names
and places in profusion, and giving
such a mass of detail that the other
could no longer doubt that they had
been acquainted somewhere in the past
where he could not say.
This was very aggravating, riot to
say mortifying, and yet in vain did
No. 2 rack his brain for some clew as
to the personality of his tormentor. He
began to wonder if he had not struck
a confidence man, who would presently
broach matters financial and proceed
to negotiate a loan.
""Do you remember your trip to Paris
in the summer of 1887?"" finally asked
No. 1.
""Yes. Did I meet you there?""
""Well, I should say so. Don't you
remember taking the Misses W to
the opera? I joined you in the box
that evening. Don't you remember
the rackets we had with George and
Billy, and all that. Oh, come now,
you must remember that.""
No. 2 shook his head mournfully.
""I remember all about George and
Billy and the Misses W , and all the
rest of it, but I can't remember you. I
beg your pardon, but I can't.""
""Well, don't you remember our meet­
ing at Saratoga in 1SS8? You were
there with your cousin, and she and I
had a desperate flirtation. See, I've
got her picture here in this locket.
Now then, Harold, old boy, you must
know me. ""
Harold stared at the locket, speech­
less. There, sure enough, were the fa­
miliar features of his Cousin Nellie, one
of the belles of New York, hanging on
the watchchain of this fellow, whom
he did not know from Adam.
""Where did you get that picture?""
""From Miss Nellie herself, of course;
see, here is the inscription she had put
there, 'Nellie to George, 1SS0.'""
Gentleman No. 2 was thunderstruck.
This was really too much, not to re­
member the fiance of his own cousin.
He was overcome with confusion, and
there is no telling how much further
things might have gone had not two
other young fellows approached at that
moment holding their sides with laugh­
ter. They were the identical George
and Billy referred to.
""Harold, old man,"" said George,
when he had recovered his gravity,
""let me introduce our excellent friend,
Mr. Henry , who never was in
Paris in his life, and who never be­
longed to the Scribblers' club, and who
detests pool, and who very improperly
borrowed this locket from me to put up
a job on you. See?"" -New York Her­

In a cellar where there is a furnace
it is a great help to household manage­
ment to have a portion of the cellar
divided from the furnace portion by a
tight board partition, with a padlocked
door opening into it. The boards used
may be rough and cheap, costing two
cents a foot, but the partition must be
tight, so as not to admit the warm air
from the furnace. Under ordinary cir­
cumstances the expense need not be
over ten dollars, and in many cases
even less.
In this cold cellar the vegetables and
apples, butter and preserves may be
kept, and even in the city the uncom­
fortable habit of living from hand to
mouth might be changed to a great de­
gree. Here the time honored vinegar
barrel or keg may have its place, giv­
ing out its supply of ""pure cider"" vine­
gar whenever needed. Near by should
be the swinging shelf and cupboard,
and the old time feeling of plenty and
comfort which the memory of the well
filled cellars of country homes always
brings, would return to the household.

I have speculated a great deal upon matri­ with

men, the pride of gay circles, married, as the nervt
world says---well! Some have moved into ducec
costly hou-es, and their friends have all come amos
and looked at their fine furniture and splend­ -th:i
id arrangements for happiness, and the have adv­
gone away and committed thenm to their sun­ fil e
uy hopes cheerfilly and without fear. It is that
natural to be sanguine for the young, and at w
such times I am carried away by similar feel­ our c
ings. I love to get unobserved into a corner teller
and watch the bride in her attire, and with ness
her smiling fitee and soft eyes moving before truth
me in the pride of life, weave a waking undi
dream over her future happiness, and per. enal
suade myself that it will be true. I think grac.
how they will sit upon the luxurious sofa, as in ot
the twilight falls, and build gay hopes, and selve
murmur in low tones the now forbidden ten­ foun
derness; and how thrillingly the allowed kiss, fer F
and the beautiful endearments of wedded brilli
liie, will make even their parting joyous, and as re
how gladly come back from the crowd and part,
the empty mirth of the gay to each other's than
quiet company. I picture to myself that ladit
young creature, who blushes even now at worl
his hesitating caress, listening eagerly for imp
his footsteps as the night steals on, and wish­ their
ing that he would come; and when he en­ ful t
ters at last, and, with an affection as undying plac
as his pulse folis her to his bosom, I can feel min
the very tide that goes flowing through his ladi
heart, antd gaze with him on her graceful tinit
form as shle moves about him for the kind lear
ottices of affection, soothing all his unquiet of j
cares, and making hiin forget even himself forti
itt her young and uuslhadowed beauty. inte
I go forward, forward fur years, and see
her luxuriant hair put soberly away from her
brow, and her girlish graces riped into digini­ '
ty. and her bright loveliness chastened with
the gentle meekness of maternal aflection.­
e
Her husband looks oni her with a proud eye, hot
and shows her the saute fervant love and the ma
delicate attentions which first won her, and
il
I fair children are growing tip about them, alld
the
tlthey go on full ot honor and untroubled years,
and are remembered when they die! °n1'
I say I love to dream thus when I go to acl
give the young bride joy. It is the niatural ""ra
tendency of feeling touched by loveliness, her
that fears nothing for itself; and if ever i Ic1
yield to darkened feelings, it is because the gro
light of the picture is clhanged. I am not Ilu
fond of dwelling upon such changes, and I like

would whisper to them, as they glide by joy­ an
ously and confidently, the secret of an un­
c clouded future. thl
The picture I have drawn above is not pe­
cnliar. It is colored like the flancies of the go
bride ; and many, oh! many an hour will she
sit, with her rich jewels laying loose in her tat
fingers, and dream such dreams as these.-­
SShe believes them too-atnd she goes on for tet
a while undeceived. The evening is not too

piness, and the quiet meal is still a pleasant in,

D attention. 'There comes soon, however, a to

wearisome, and slight attentions will not

long hours of unhappy restlessness, and ter­ fa

SOLOMON'S 0HOIOE.
5. In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon
in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I
shall give thee.
6. And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto
thy servant David my father great mercy ac­
cording as he walked before thee in truth, and in
righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with
thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kind,
ness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his
throne, as it is this day.
7. And now, O LonD my God, thou hast made
thy servant king instead of David my father;i
and I anm but a little child: I know not how to go
out or come in.
8. And thy servant is in the midst of thy peo­
ple which thou hast chosen, a great people, that
cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
9. Give therefore thy servant an understand­
ing heart to judge thy people, that I may dis­
cern between good and bad: for who is able to
judge this thy so great a people ?
10. And the speech pleased the LoD, that
Solomon had asked this thing.
11. And God said unto him, Because thou hast
asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself
long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself,
nor hast asked the life of thine enemies: but hast
asked for thyself understanding to discern judg­
ment:
12. Behold, I have done according to thy words:
lo, I have given thee a wise and an understand­
ing heart; so that there was none like thee be­
fore thee, neither after thee shall any arise like
unto thee.
13. And I have also given thee that which
thou hast not asked, both riches and honor; so
that there shall not be any among the kings like
unto thee all thy days.
14. And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep
my statutes and my commandments, as thy
father D)avid did walk, then I will lengthen thy
days.
15. And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a
dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood
before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and
offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace­
offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.

jacts to take up
arms against him
Sir John Coch­
rane was one of
the most form­
idable enemies to

his dangerous
nsurpations.and one ef the most prom­
inent actors in Arg-yle'a rebellion. For,
agea a destructire doom seemed to
hae hung1 over the house of Camp­
bell, uniting in . common rain all
k who joined their fortunes to the cause
of its chief. Sir John Cochrane was
no exception. He ' was surrounded
by the king's troops, and, after a long
and desperate resistance.he was taken
prisoner, and was tried and condemned
to die upon the scaffold. He had but
a few days to live, and his jailer
awaited only the arrival of the death­
warrant to lead him to execution.
His friends had visited him and ex­
changed the last farewells all but
one; his daughter Grizel, the pride of
his house, his dearest treasure, she
alone had not come to receive his last
blessing.
Night had fallen on the prison, and
the father sat with his head pressed
against the cold, damp walls of his
cell, longing for a last look of his
favorite child, when the door oxened,
and the keeper entered, followed by a
young and beautiful girl. Her person
was tall and commanding, her eyes
dark, bright, and tearless with a sor­
row too deep to be weDt away. The
unhappy prisoner raised his head.
'My child! my own Grizel!"" he ex­
claimed, as he Dressed her to his heart
""My father! my dear father!""
sobbed the miserable maiden.
""Your interview must be short, very

short,"" said the jailer as he closed the

door, and left them together.
""Heaven helD and comfort

thee, my precious child!"" said
61r John. ""I had feared that I

should die without bestowing my

blessing on the head of my daughter,

and that stung me more than death;
but thou art come, my love thou art
come! and the last blessing of thy
wretched father ""
""Nay, father, forbear!"" she ex­
claimed; ""not thy last blessing! not
thy last! My father shall not die!""
""Be calm,"" be calm, my child,"" he
said. ""Would to Leaven that I could
comfort thee, mv own! But there is
no hope; within three days thou and
all my little ones will be "" Father­
less, he would have said, but the
words died upon his lips
""Three days,"" she repeated, raising
her head from his breast, but eagerly
pressing his hand; ""three days! then
there is hope my father shall live.
Is not my grandfather the friend of
Father Petre, the confessor and mas­
ter of the king? From him he shall
beg the life of his son, and my father
shall not die.""




""DISMOBTtTl-miED THE STBANGEB.

t'Nay, nay, my Grizel,"" he returned,

'be not deoieved; there is no hope.
Already my doom is sealed. ' ; Already
"" the king has signed the order for my
- execution, and the - messenger of
death is now on his way.""
' ""Yet my father shall not shall not
,. die!"" she repeated emphatically, and
clasping her hands, ""Heaven speed a
daughter's purpose!'' , she exclaimed;
, and turning to her father, said calmly,
"".'. ""We part now, but we shall 1 meet
again.""
T ""What do you mean, my child?"" he
inquired eagerly, gazing anxiously
on her face.
""Ask not now, she replied, 'my
father, ask not now. Pray for me,
f and bless me, but not with thy last
-'""-.blessing. "",
He again pressed her"" to his heart,
and wept upon her neck. In a few
,: momenta the jailer entered, and the
door was closed between the father
c and daughter.
On the evening of the second day
after this interview, a wayfaring man
crossed the drawbridge at Berwick
: from the north, and, proceeding along
- Marygate, sat down to rest upon a
j bench, by the door of an inn on
the south aide of the street,
nearly fronting the spot where
i what was called the ""main guard""
. then stood. He did not enter the inn,
for it was, above his apparent con­
.' dition, bing that which Oliver Crom­
.wetf had made his headquarters a few
years before, and where, at a some-
I what earlier period, .James VI, of
' Scotland had taken up his residence,
when on hit way to England The
traveler wore a coarse jerkin, fastened
round the waist by a leathern girdle,
ad over it a short eloak of plain
material. He was evidently a young
man, but his beaver was drawn down
o as almost to conceal his features.
II In one hand he carried a small bnndle,
and in the others staff. Having called
i f a r'is of wine, ha took a crust of
"" Jad from hi bundle, and after rat-

lug a short time, rose to depart Night
was coming on, and a storm was
threatening. The heavens grew black;
the clouds rushed from the set; sud­
den gusts of wind moaned through
the streets, accompanied by heavy
drops of rain, and the face of the
Tweed was troubled.
""Heaven help thee if thou iotendest
to travel far in such a night as this.'""
said the sentinel at the English gate,

as the traveler passed him to cross the
bridge. ' , .
In a few minutes he was npon the
wide and desolate moor of .Tweed­
mouth; which for miles presented a
desert of furze, fern, and stunned
heath, with here and there a copse of
thick brushwood. He tlowlr toiled

over the steep hill, braving the storm,
which now raged with the wildest
fury. The rain fell in tot rents, and
the wind howled like a legion of fam­
ished wolves, hurling its doleful echoes

over the heath. Still the stranger

pushed onward, until two or three
miles from Berwick, when, as if nna-

ble to longer brave the storm, he

sought shelter amidst some bushes by

the wayside. Nearly an hour had
passed bio.ee he sought this imperfect
refuge, and the darkness of the night
and the storm had increased together,
when the sound of a horse's feet was
heard hurriedly plashing along the
road. The rider bent his head to the

blast Suddenly his horse was
grasped by the bridle; the rider raised
his head, and the stranger stood be

fore him holding a pistol tq his

breast ""Dismount!"" cried the
stranger sternly-

The horseman, benumbed and fear­
stricken, made an effort to reach his
arms; but instantly the hand of the
robber, quitting the bridle, grasped
the breast of the rider and dragged
him to the ground. He fell heavily
on his face, and for several minutes
was senseless. The stranger seized
the leather bag which contained the
mail for the north and flinging it
across his shoulder, rushed across the
heath.
Early on the following morning the
inhabitants of Berwick were seen
hurrying in groups to the spot where
the robbery had been committed, but
no trace of the robber could be ob­
tained.Three days had passed and Sir John

Cochrane still lived. The mul which

contained his death-warrant had been
robbed, and before another order for

his execution could be given, the in

tereession of his father, the earl of

Dundonald, with the king's con­
fessor, might be successful.
Grizel now became the almost
constant companion of her father.
Nearly a fortnight had passed
since the robbery of the mail, and
protracted hope in the bosom of the
prisoner became more bitter than his
first despair. But even that hope,
bitter as it was, perished. The in­
tercession of his father had been
unsuccessful; and a second King James
signed the death-warrant Within
little more than another day that
warrant would reach the prison.
""The will of Heaven be done!""
groaned the captive.
""Amen!"" responded Grizel with wild
vehemence, ""yet my father shall not
die."" . ,y,'-'-V .
Again the rider with the mail had
reached the moor of Tweedmouth,
and a second time he bore with him
the doom of Sir John Cochrane. He
spurred his horse to its utmost speed
he looked cautiously before, behind,
and around, and in his right hand he
carried a pistol ready to defend him­
self. The moon shed a ghostly light
across the heath. . He turned the
angle af a straggling corpse when his
horse reared at the report of a pistol,
the fire of which seemed to flash in its
very eyes. At the same moment
his own .; pistol went off, and,
his horse again rearing, he
was thrown from the saddle-;
In a moment the robber with his foot
upon th&amp; Jorwast rff the messenger, was
ji .1-1 1

oeuuiujr uvcr mux auu uranuisuing a
short dagger, saying:
""Give me thine arms, or die!"".
The heart of the king's servant
failed him, and, without venturing a
reply, he did as he was commanded
,; ""Now go thy way,"" said the robber
sternly, ""but leave me thy horse and
the mail, lest a worse thing come upon
thee."" -
The man arose, and returned to
Berwick, and the robber, mounting
the: horse, rode rapidly across the
hnfh. .rii'i; ; . :'. -'.'i
' Preparations were making for the
execution of Sir John Cochrane, and
the officers of the law waited only for
the arrival of the mail with the sec­
ond death-warrant, when the news
arrived that the mail had again been

robbed. 5 s For yet fourteen days the
prisoner's life would be prolonged.
Putting his arms about bis daughter,
he said, ""It is good. The hand of

""Said 1 not"" replied bis child, and
for the first time she wept, ""said I not
that my father should not die?""
The fourteen days were not past
when the prison-door flew open, and
the earl of Dundonald rushed to the
arms of his son. His intercession with
the confessor had been successful, and,
after twice signing the warrant for
the execution of Sir John, the king
had sealed his pardon.
He hurried with his father to hit
own house; his family were clinging
around him, shedding tears of joy.
Gtizel only was absent They were
marveling with gratitude at the mys­
terious providence that had twice in­
tercepted the mail, and saved his lite,
when a stranger craved an audience.
Sir John desired him to be admitted,
and the robber entered; he was dressed
In a coarse cloak, and coarser jerkin,
bvt his bearing seemed beyond his
condition. On entering, he slightly
touched his beaver, but did no4ra
move it
""When you have read these,"" said
he, taking two paoers from his bosom,
""cast them into the fire.""
, Sir John glanced them over-

started, and became pain. They wen
his death warrants. - ,
""My deliverer!"" he exclaimed; 'oa
hovr shall I thank the- how repay
the saviour of my life? ' My father
my children thank him for me!""
The old earl grasped the hand of
the stranger the children embraced
his knees. He pressed his hand to his
lace, and burst into tears.
""By what name,"" eagerly inqnired
Sir John, ""shall I thank 'my deliv

erer."" . ' -. - , - '

It is unnecessary to add more. The
reader can supply the rest, and we
may only add that Grizel Cochrane,
whose heroism we have briefly

sketched, was the grandmother of the
grandmother of the late Sir John
Stewart of Allendank in Berwickshire
and great-grandmother of Mr. Coutts,
the celebrated banker. Consequently
she was the greatgreat-great-grand-mother

Men Sized Fp by One

Knows Them WetL
The man who poses as 'a summer
beau par excellence is generally far
more silly than his feminine op­
posite. In many instances he ia off
on a vacation of but two weeks, and
has saved up all his odd pennies
toward the acquirement of a varied
wardrobe with which he intends to
dazzle the eyes of the girls with
whom he comes in contact He
changes his clothes three or four

times a day, and is as particular
about having every article up to the
top notch of fashion as a woman ia
regarding the fit of her gown.
As an excuse for his personal van­
ity it must be said that he is very
young, says the Washington Supper
Table. Sense comes with years, and
he has no desire later on to pose as a
summer man. Even though his con­
cern over his various suits of clothes
is his only weakness, when he ar­
rives at a hotel he will undoubtedly
acquire another one before he has
been long 'under the roof, for the

scarcity of men who are willing to
dance attendance upon the caprices
of the summer girl makes him popu

lar at once, even though he may not
have a grain of sense in his head or
more than his two weeks' salary in
his pocket
This consideration at once causes

him to think that he is a very faaci-.

nating creature, and he acts on this
principle until an influx of masou­
lines on Saturday night opens his
eyes to the fact he was all right if
there were no others around, but
when there are several to be com­
manded he is not so important a
personage as he imagined.
Sometimes it is pitiful to see the
way a summer man is snubbed when
others more worthy to be angled for
appear upon the scene, and yet from
season to season he bobs up serene­
ly, and is content to be the great ""I
am"" during the week and , take sec­
ond place over Sunday. As a parcel
carrier, a candy buyer and an excel­
lent target for flirtation practice the
summer man is all right, but as a
husband who can be. depended on in
sickness and in health, for, better or
for : worse, he is not . to be recom­
mended as yet. -

                 I saw an aged man upon his bier,
                 Ills hair was thin and white, and on his brow A record of the cares of many a year;
                 Carts, that were ended and forgotten now,
                 And there was madness round, and faces bowed,
                 And woman s tear fell fut and children walled
                 aloud.
                 Then rose another hoary man and said,
                 In faltering accents, to that weeping train, Why mourn ye, that our aged friend is dead?
                 Ye are not sad to see the gathered grain,
                 Nor when their mellow fruits the orchards cast,
                 Nor when the yellow woods shake down the ripen-

                 Ye sigh not when the sun, his course fulfilled,
                 His glorious course, rejoicing earth and sky, In the soft evening, when the winds are ,

                 Why weep ye then for him, who, having run

                 sage,
                 Faded his late declining years away.
                 Cheerful he gave his being up, and went
                 To share the holy rest that wait, a life well spent.
                 That life was happy; every day lie gave

THE FARMER.

BY LILLIK K. BARB.

L
The king may rule o'er land and sea,
The lord may livo right royally,
The soldier ride in pomp and pride,
The sailor roam o'er ocean wide,
But this, or that, whate'cr befall,
The Farmer he must feed them all.
11. •
The writer thinks, the poet sings,
The craftsmen fashion wondrous things,
The doctor heals, the lawyer pleads,
The miner follows the precious leads,
But this, or that, whate'er befall,
The tanner must feed them all.
BL
The merchant may buy and sell,
The teacher do his duty well,
But men may toil through busy days,
Or men may stroll through pleasant ways,
From King to beggar whate'er befall,
The farmer he must feed them all.
IV.
The farmer's trade is one of worth
He's partner with the sky and earth,
He's partner with the sun and rain,
A id no man loses for his gain,
And men may rise and men may fall,
But the Farmer he must feed them all.
V.
The Farmer dares his mind to speak,
He has no gift or place to seek,
To no man living need he bow;
The man that walks behind the plough
Is his own master, whatever befall,
And sine or beggur he leeds us all.
VI.
God bless the man who sows the wheat.
Who finds us milk, and fruit and meat;
May his purse bo heavy, his heart be light,
His cattle, his corn, and all, go right,
God bless tbe seeds his hands let fall,
For the Farmer he must feed us all.

                 And the boy was just as tall I A royal tiger lily,
                 With spots of purple and gold,

                 And the wee pink fists of the baby

                 II you are in the least doubtful as to that point-let them be rather lon.
                 It you have good teeth-don't forget to laugh now and-then.
                 If you have bad ones-you must only simper.
                 While you are young-sit with your face to the
                 When you are a little advanced-sit with your back to the window.
                 If you have a bad voice-always speak in a low tofle.
                 If it is acknowledged that you have a fine voice- never speak in a higIi one.
                 If you dance well-dance but seldom. It you dance ill-never dance at all.
                 If you sing well-make no previous excuses.
                 It you a sing indifferentlv-hesitate not a moment when you are asked; for few persons are competent judges of singing, but every one is sensible of a desire to please.
                 If in conversation you think a person wrong-rather hint a difference of opinion than ofler a contradiction.
                 If you find a person telling an absolute ilasehood- let it pass over in silence; it is not worth your while to make any one your enemy, by proving him a liar.
                 It is always in your power to make a friend by smiles-what a folly to make enemies by frowns!
                 When you have an opportunity to praise-do it with all your heart.
                 When you are forced to blame-appear, at least, to do it with reluctance.
                 If you are envious of another woman-never show it but by allowing her every good quality and perfec. tion except those she really possesses.
                 If you wish to let the world know you are in love with a particular man-treat him with formality, and every one else with ease and freedom.
                 If you are disposed to be pettish or insolent-it is better to exercise your ill humor on your dog, your cat, or your servant, than your friends.
                 If you would preserve beauty-rise early. If you would preserve esteem-be gentle.
                 If you would obtain power-be condescending.
                 It you would live happy-endeavor to promote the happiness of others.

                 NIGHT.
                 BRY JAMES MONTGOMERY.
                 Night is the time for rest;
                 Hfow sweet, when labors close,
                 To gather round our aching breast
                 The curtain 'of repose:
                 Stretch the tired limb, and lay the head Upon our own delightful bed! Night is the time for dreams;
                 The gay romance of life,
                 When truth that 's  that seems,
                 Blend in fantastic strife
                 Ah! visions less beguiling far
                 Thanj waking  by daylight are.
                 Night is the time for toil;
                 To plough the classic field, Intent to find the buried spoil
                 Its wealthy furrows yield;
                 'Till all is ours that sages taught,
                 That poets sung, or heroes wrought.
                 Night is the time to weep;
                 To wet with unseen tears
                 Those graves of memory, where sleep
                 The joys of other years;
                 Hopes that were angels in their birth.
                 But perished young like things of earth!
                 Night is the time to watch;
                 On ocean s dark expanse,
                 To hail the Pleiades, or catch
                 The full moon s earliest glance,
                 That brings into the home-sick mind All that we loved and left behind. Night is the time for care
                 Brooding on hours misspent, To see the Spectre of Despair
                 Come to our lonely tent;
                 Like Brutus midst his slumbering host, Startled by Caesar's stalworth ghost. Night is the time to muse;
                 Than. from the eye the soul
                 Takes flight, and with expanding Views
                 Beyond the starry pole,
                 Descries athwart the abyss of night The dawn of uncreated light.
                 Sight is the time to pray;
                 Our Saviour oft withdrew
                 To desert mountains far away,
                 So will his followers do;
                 Steal from the throng to haunts untrod, And hold communion there with God.
                 Night is the time for death;
                 When all around is peace,
                 Calmly to yield the weary breath,
                 From sin and suffering cease:

noll at u Cbild'w Grave.
Washington, Jan. 6. In a re­
mote corner of the cougressionai
cemetery this atternoou, with un­
covered heads, were ranged around
a newly-opened grave a small group
of the friends of Detective and Mrs.
George O. Miller, who had gathered
to witness the burial ot their bright
little son Harry, u recent victim of
dipthena. As the casket rested
upon the trestles there was a pain­
ful pause, brokeu only by the mo
ther's sobs, uniil the undertaker ad
vanced toward a stout, florid-coni'
plexioucd gentleman m the party,
and whispered to him, the words
beiug inaudible to the lookers-on,
This gentleman was Col. Robert G
lugersoll, a friend of the Millers,
who attended the funeral at their
request. He shook his head when
the undertaker first addressed him,
and then said suddenly: ""Docs Mr.
Miller desire it?"" The undertaker
gave an affirmative nod, Mr. Miller
looked appealingly towards the
noted orator, and Colonel Ingersoll
advanced to the side of the grave,
made a motion denoting a desire
for silence, and in a voice of ex­
quisite cadence delivered one of his
characteristic eulogies lor the dead
The scene was intensely uramntic.
A fine drizzling rain was falling,
and every head was bent and every
ear turned to catch the words of
eloquence and hope that, fell from
the lips of the distinguished speaker.
Colonel Ingersoll was unprotected
by cither hat or umbrella, and his
invocation thrilled his hearers with
awe, each eye that had previously
been bediinmod wilh tears bright­
ening, and sobs becoming hushed.
COLONEL INUEKSOLL'S OltATION.
Colonel Ingersoll said :
""My friend's, I know how vain it
is to gild a grief with words, and
yet I wish to take from every grave
its fear. Herein this world, where
life and death arc equal kings, all
should be brave enough to meet
what all the dead have met The
future has been filled with fear­
stained and polluted by the heart­
less past. From the wondrous tree
of life the buds and blossoms fall
with ripened fruit, and in the com­
mon bed of earth the patriarchs and
babes sleep side by side. Why
should we fear that which will come
to all ? That is, we cann&amp;t tell, we
do not know, which is the greater
blessing life or death. We can­
not say that death is not
a good conditiou. We do not
know whether the grave is the
end of this life or the door
of another ; . or, whether the
night here is not somewhere else a
dawn. Neither can we tell which
is the more fortunate, the child dy­
ing iu his mother's arms before its
lips have learned to form a word, or
he who journeys all the length of
life's uneven road, painfully taking
the last slow steps with stall and
crutch. Every cradle asks us
'Whence 3 and every coffin
'Whither?' :The poor barbarian,
weeping o er his dead, can answer
thc6C questions as intelligently aud
satisfactorily a3 the robed priest of
the most authentic creed. The tear­
ful iguoranco of the one is just as
consoling as the learned ""aud un­
meaning words of the other. No man,
standing where the horizon of a life
has touched a grave, has any right
to prophesy a future filled with pain
and tears, it may be that death gives
all there is ot worth to life. If
those we press and strain against
our hearts could never die, perhaps
that love would wither from the
earth. May be tbis common"" fate
treads from out the paths between
our hearts the weeds of selfishness
and hate, and I had rather live and
love where death is king than have
eternal life where lovo is not
Another life is naught unless we
know and love again the ones who
love us here They who stand with
breaking hearts around this little
grave need have no fear. The larger
and nobler faith in all that is and is
to be, tells us that death, even at its
worst, is only perfect rest
We know that through the com­
mon wants of life the neeus and
duties of each hour their grief will
lesson day by day, until at last the
grave will be to them a place of rest
and peace almost of joy. Thero is
for them this consolation the dead
do not sutler. If they live again,
their lives will surely be as good as
ours, who have no fear. We are all

                 I walk my parlour floor,
                 And, through the open door,
                 I hear a foot-fall on his chamber stair;
                 I'm stepping toward the hall To give the boy a call;
                 And then bethink me that-he is not there!
                 I thread the crowded street- A satclell'd lad I meet,
                 With the same beaming eyes and coloured hair;
                 And, as he's running by, Follow him with my eye,
                 Scarcely believing that-he is not there!
                 I know, his face is hid Under the coffin lid;
                 Closed are hid eyes;-cold is his forehead fair.

                 So long watched over with parental care,
                 My spirit and my eye Seek it inquiringly

                 My soul goes up, with joy, To Him who gave my boy,
                 Then comes the sad thought that-he is not there!
                 When, at the day's calm close, Before we seek repose,
                 I'm with his mother, of'ering up our prayer,

                 For our boy's spirit, though-he is not there'!

                 My winged boat, A bird afloat,
                 Swims round the purple peaks remote,
                 Round purple peaks It sails, and seeks
                 Blue inlets and then crystal creeks,
                 Where high rocks throw, Tlirough deeps below, A duplicated golden glow.
                 Far, vague, and dim,
                 The mountains swim;
                 While on Vesuvius' misty brim,
                 With outstretched hands, The gray smoke stands,
                 O'erlooking the volcanic lands.
                 Here Ischia smiles O'er liquid miles;
                 And yonder, bluest of the isles,
                 Calm Capri waits,
                 Her sapphire gates
                 Beguiling to her bright estates.

                 Her children, hid The cliffs amid,
                 Are gamboling with the gamboling kid;
                 Or, down the walls, With tipsy calls,
                 Laugh on the rocks like waterfalls.

At this Easter service I ask and answer
what may seem a novel question, but it will
be found, before I get through, a practical
and useful and tremendous question. What
will Resurrection day do for the cemeteries?
First, I remark it will be their supernatural
beautification. At certain seasons it is cus­
tomary in all lands to strew flowers over
the mounds of the departed. It may have
been suggested by the fact that Christ's
tomb was in a garden. And when 1 say
garden I do not mean a garden of these lati­
tudes. The late frosts of spring aud the
early frosts of autumn are so near to each
other that there are ouly a few months
of flowers in the field. All the flowers
we see to-day had to be petted and coaxed
and put under shelter or they would not have
bloomed at all. They are the children of the
conservatories. But at this season and
through the most of the year, the Holy Land
is all ablush with floral opulence. You find
all the royal family of flowers there, some
that you supposed indigenous to the far north,
and others indigenous to the far south the
daisy and hyacinth, crocus and anemone,
tulip and water lily, geranium and ranuncu
lus, mignonette and sweet marjoram.
In the college at Beyrout you may sea
Dr. Post's collection of about eighteen hun­
dred kinds of Holy Land flowers; while
among the trees are the oak of frozen climes,
and the taniaris'c of the tropics, walnut and
willow, ivy and hawthorn, ash and elder,
pine and sycamore. If such floral and bo­
tanical beauties are tho wild growths of the
fields think of what a garden must be in Pal­
estine! And in such a garden Jesus Christ
slept after, on the soldier's spear. His last
drop of blood had coagulated. And then see
how appropriate that all our cemeteries
should be floralized and tree shaded. In J une,
Greenwood is Brooklyn's garden.
""Well, then,"" you say, ""how can you
make out that the Resurrection day will
beautify the cemeteries? Will it not leave
them a plowed up ground? On that day
there will be an earthquake, and will not this
split the polished Aberdeen granite, as well
as the Dlain slab that can afford but the two
words, 'Our Mary,' or 'Our Charley?"" ""
Well, 1 will tell you how Resurrection day
will beautify all the cemeteries. It will be by
bringing up the faces that were to us once, an 1
in our memories are to us now, more beauti­
ful than any calla lily, and the forms that
are to us more graceful than any willow by
the waters. Can you think of anything more
beautiful thau the reappearance of those
from whom we have been parted?. I do not
care which way the tree falls in the blast of
the judgment hurricane, or if the plowshare
that day shall turn under the last rose leaf
and the last China aster, if out of the broken
sod shall come the bodies of our loved onet
not damaged, but irradiated.
The idea of the resurrection gets easier to
understand as I hear the phonograph unroll
some voice that talked into it or sung into it
a rear ago. iust before our friend's decease.
xou turn the wire, and then come forth the
very tones, the very accentuation, the very
00 ugh, the very song of the person that
breathed into it once, but is now departed. Ii
man can do that, cannot Almighty God,
without half trying, return the voice of your
departed? And if he can return the voice.
why not the lips and the tongue and the
throat that fashioned the voice? And
if the lips and the tongue and the
tnroat, why not then the brain that sug
gested the words? And if the brain, why not
u nerves, 01 wnicn tue Dram is the head­
quarters? And if he can return the nerve
why not the muscles, which are less in­
genious? And if the muscles, why not the
bones, that are less wonderful? And if the
voice and tbe brain and the muscles and the
bones, why not the entire body? If man can
do the phonograph, God can do the resurrec­
tion. Will It be the same body that in the
last day shall be reanimated? Yea, but in-
nniraiy unproved.
Our bodies change everr seven Tears, and
yet, in one sense, it is the same body. On my
wrist and the second finger of my right band
there is a scar. I made that at twelve years
of age, when, disgusted at the presence of
two warts, I took a red hot iron and burned
them off, and burned them out. Since then
my body has changed at least a half domrn
times, but those scars prove it is the same
body. And we never km our identity. If
(ton can and does sometimes reboild a
man five, six, ten times, in this world,
is it mysterious that He can rebuild him once
more, and that in tbe resurrection? If He
can do it ten times, I think He can do it
eleven times. Then look at the seventeen­
year locusts. For seventeen years gone, at
the end of seventeen years tbey appear, and

by rubbing ths hind leg against ths wing
make that rattle at which ail tha huibanl­
men and Tins dressers irwnbls as tha in

sect tie host takes up the march of devasta­
tion. Resurrection every seventeen years!
Another oonnideratiou makes tha Idea of
resurrection easier. Uod mail Adam. 11
was not fashioned after ant model. Then
had never been a humau organism, and so
there was nothing to copy. At the first at.
tempt Uod made a perfect man. He mads
him out of ths dutt of ths earth. If out of
ordinary dust of ths earth and without
model Uod could make a nerfeut man. surely
Out of the extraordiuary dust of the mortal
uony, ana witu minions 01 moaeis, uoti can
make each one of us a perfect being in tha
resurrection. Surely the last under­
taking would not be greater than ths tint.
See ths rosiwl algebra 1 ordinary dust minus
a model equals a perfect man; extraordinary
dust and plus a modal equals a resurrection
body. Mysteries about it? Ob, yes; that is
one reason why I believe it. It would not be
much or a uod who eouid 00 wings only as
far as I can Understand. Mysteries? Ob,
yes: but no more about the resurrection of
your body than about Its present existence.
I will explain to you the last mystery of
the resurrection, and make it as plain to you
as that two and two make four, ii you will
tell me how your mind, which is entirely in­
dependent of your body, can act upon your
body so that at your will your eyes open, or
Sour foot walks, or your hand Is extended,
o I find nothing in the Bible statement con­
cerning the resurrection that staggers ms for
a moment. All doubts clear from my mind.
1 say that tbe cemeteries, however oeautirul
now, will be more beautiful when the bodies
of our loved ones come up.
Thev will oome in imuroved condition.
They will come up rested. The most of them
lay down at the last very tired, now 01 ten
tou have heard them sayi ""I am so tired!""
The tact is it is a tired world. If I should go
through this audience, and go round the
world. I could not find a Demon in any style
of life ignorant of the sensation of fatigue. I
not believe there are ntty persons in mis
idience who are not tired. Your bead is
tired, or your back is tired, or your foot is
tired, or your brain is tired,
or your nerves are tired. Long jour­
neying, or business application, or
bereavement, or sickness have put on you
heavy weights. Bo the vast majority of
those who went out of this world went out
fatigued. About tha poorest plaos to rest
In is this World. Its atmosphere, its sur­
roundings, and even its hilarities are ex­
hausting. So God stops our earthly life, and
mercifully closes the eyes, and qniets tha
feet, and folds the hamKand more especially
frives quiescence to the lungs and heart, that
lave not had ted minutes' rest from the first
respiration and the first beat.
If a drummer boy were compelled in the
army to beat his drum for twenty-four hours
without stopping, his officer would be court­
martialed for cruelty. If the drummer boy
should be commanded to beat his drum for a
week without ceasing, day and night, he
would die in attempting it. But under your
vestment is a poor heart that began its drum
beat for the march of life thirty or forty of
sixty or eighty years ago, and ft has had no
furlough by day or night; and, whether in
conscious or comatose state, it went right on,
for if it had stopped seven seconds your life
Would have closed. And your heart will keep
going Until some time after your spirit has
flown, for the auscultator says that after ths
last expiration of lung and the last throb of
pulse, and after the spirit is released, the
heart keeps on beating for a time. What a
mercy then it is that the crave is the place
where that wondrous machinery of ventricle
and artery can halt I
Under the healthful chemistry of the soil
Ml the Wear and tear of nerve and muscle
and bone will be subtracted and that bath of
good, fresh, clean soil will wash off the last
ache, and then some of the same style of
dust out of which the body of Adam was
constructed may be infused into the resur­
rection body. How can the bodies of the
human race, which have had no replenish­
ment from the dust since the time of Adam
in paradise, get any recuperation from the
store-house from which ha was constructed
without oar going back into the dust? That
original, life-giving material having beeu
added to the body as it once was, and all the
defects left behind, what a body will be the
resurrection body I And will not hundreds
of thousands of such appearing above the
Gowanus heights make Greenwood more
beautiful than any June morning after -a
shower?
The dust of the earth being the original
material for the fashioning of the first human
being, we have to go back to the same place
to get a perfect body. Factories are apt to
be rough places, and those who toil in them
have their garments grimy and their hands
smutched. But who cares for that, when
they turn out for us beautiful musical instru­
ments or exquisite upholstery I What though
the grave is a rough place, it is a resurrec­
tion body manufactory, and from it shall
come the radiant and resplendent forms of
our friends on ths brightesi morning the
world saw ever. You put Into a factory cot
ton, and it comes out apparel. You put into
a factory lumber and lead, and it comes out
pianos and organs. Aud so into the factory
of th3 grave you put in pneumonias and con
sumptions, and they come out health. You
put in groans, and they come out hallelujahs.
For us, on thermal day, the mnst attractive
places will not be the pirks or the gardens or
the palaces, but the cemeteries.
We are not told in what season that day
will come. If it should be winter, those who
come up will be more lustrous than the snow
that covered them. If in the autumn, those
who come up will be more gorgeous than the
woods after the frost3 have penciled them.
If in the spring, the bloom on which they
tread will be dull comoared with the rubi­
cund of their cheeks. 6h the perfect resur­
rection body I Almost every one has some
defective spot in his physical constitution;
a dull ear, or a dim eye, or arheumatiofoot,
or a neuralgic brow, or a twisted muscle, or
a weak side, or an inflamed tonsil, or soma
point at which the east wind or a
season of overwork assaults him. But
tha resurrection body shall ba without
one weak spot, and all that tiie doctors and
nurses and apothecaries of earth will there­
after have to do will b3 to rest without inter­
ruption after the broken nights of their earth­
ly existence Not only will that day be the
beatification of well kept cemeteries, but
some of the graveyards that have been neg­
lected, and been the pasture ground for cat­
tle and rooting places for swiiie. will for the
first time have attractiveness given them.
It was a shams that in that place ungrate­
ful generations planted no trees, and twisted
no garlands, and sculptured no marble for
then- Christian ancestry; but on the day of
which I speak the resurrected shall make
the place of their feet glorious. From
under the shadow of the church, where
they slumbered among nettles and
mullen stalks and thistles, and slabs
aslant, they shall rise with a glory that shall
flash the windows of the village church, and
by the bell tower that used to call them to
worship, and above tne old spire beside
which their prayers formerly ascended.
What triumphal procession never did for a
street, what au oratorio never did for an
academy, what an orator never did for a
brilliant auditory, what obelisk never -did
for a King, resurrection morn will do for all
the cemeteries.
This Easter tells us that in Christ's resur­
rection our resurrection, if we are His, and
the resurrection of all the pioas dead is as­
sured, for He was ""the first fruits of them
that slept."" Renan says He did not rise, but
five hundred m l eighty witnesses, sixty of
them Christ'i enemies, say He did rise, for
they saw Him after He had risan. If He did
not rise, how did sixty arme.l soldiers let
Him get away? Surely sixty living soldiers
ouzht to bs able to keep one dead maul
Blessed be God! He did get away. After
His resurrection Mary Magdalene saw Him.
Cleopas saw Him. Ten disciples in an
upper room at Jernsaljm saw Him. On a
mountain the eleven saw Him. Five hundred
at once saw Him. Professor Ernest Renan,
who did not see Him, will excuse us for tak­
ing the testimony of the five hundred and
eighty who did see Him. Yes, yes; He got
away. And that makes me sure that our de­
parted lovei ones and we ourselves shall get
away. Freed Himself from the shackles of
clod, He is not goinj to leave ns and ours
in the lurch.
There will ba no door knob on the inside of
our family sepulchre, for we cannot come
out, of ourselves; but there is a door knobon
the outside, and that Jesus shall lay hold of,
and ojiening, will say: ""Good morning! You
have slept long enough! Arise! Arise!"" And
then what flutter of wings, and what flashing
of rekindled eyes, and what gladsome rush­
ing across tho family lot, with cries of
""Father, is that you?"" ""Mother, is that
you?"" ""My darling, is that you?"" ""How
you all have changed! The cough gone,

                 They were standing where a brook, Bending like a shepherd s crook,
