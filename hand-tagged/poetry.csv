that Mr. O'Neill was 72 years old when

A little face above the spread;
A little shoe upon the floor,
A little frock behind the door;
A little lad with dark brown hair,
A little blue-eyed face and fair;
A little lane that leads to school,
A little pencil, slate and rule;
A little. winsome, blithesome maid,
A little hand within his laid.

      selected the following poem for his paper this week, which appears in the last number.]
                 Like a blind spinner in the sun,
                 I tread my days;
                 I know that all the threads will run
                 Appointed ways.;
                 I know each day will bring its task, And, being blind, no more I ask. I do not know the use or name
                 Of that I spin ;
                 I only Lnow that some one came,
                 And laid within
                 My hand the thread and said "" Since you Are blind, but one thing you can do.""
                 Sometimes the threads so rough and fast
                 And tangled fly,
                 I know wild storms are sweeping past,
                 And fear that I
                 Shall fall; but dare not try to find A safer place, since I am blind. I know not why, but I am sure
                 That tint and place,
                 In some great fabric to endure
                 Past time and race,
                 My threads will have; so from the first Though blind, I never felt accursed.
                 I think, perhaps, this trust has sprung
                 From one short word
                 Said over me when I was young,So
                 young, I heard
                 It, knowing not that God's name signed
                 My brow, and sealed me His, though . But whether this be seat or sign
                 Within, without,
                 It matters not. The bond divine
                 I never doubt.
                 I know He set me here, and still,
                 And glad, and blind, I wait His will; But listen, listen, day by day,
                 To hear their tread
                 Who bear the finished web away,
                 And cut the thread,
                 And bring God's message in the sun,
                 ""Thou poor blind spinner, work is done.""

Henceforward, listen as we will,
The voices of that hearth are still;
Look where we may, the wide earth

Those lighted laces smile no more.

worn,
We sit beneath their orchard trees.
We hear, like them, the hum of bees
And rustle of the bladed coru.

We turn the pages that they read

Their Written words we linger o'er.
But in the eun they cast no shade,
No voice is heard, no sign is made,
No step la on the conscious floor!
Yet love will dream, and faith will
trust.

That somehow, somewhere, meet we
must. '
Alas for him who never sees
The stars shine through his cypress
trees!
Who, hopeless, lays his dead away,
Nor looks to see the breaking day
Across the mournful marbles play!
Who hath not learned, in hours of faith
The truth to flesh and sense unknown,
That life is ever lord of death,
And love can never lose Its own.

Oh, hear me, then, my passion own,
With trembling lips, in earnest tone;
Indeed I speak the truth.

                 .James Whitcomnb R1ley-Boston Pilot
                 As one who cons at evening o er an album all alone,
                 And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known; So I turn the leaves of fancy till in shadowy design
                 I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine.
                 The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise As I turn it  to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes.
                 And I light my pipe in silence, save a sigh that seems to yoke Its fate with my tobacco, and to vanish in the smoke.
                 'Tis a fragrant retrospection, for the loving thoughts that start Into being are like perfume from the blossoms of the heart; And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine,
                 When my truant fancy wanders with that old sweetheart of mine. Though I hear, beneath my study, like a fluttering of wings, The voices of my children and the mother as she sings, I feel no  of consc.ence to deny me any theme
                 When care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream. In fact, to speak in earnest, I believe it adds a charm To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm; For I find an extra flavor in memory s mellow vine
                 That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine. A face of lily beauty and a form of airy grace
                 Floats out of my tobacco as the genius from the vase; And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies.
                 I can see the pink sun-bonnet and the little checkered dress
                 She wore when first I kissed her, and she answered the caress With the written declaration that, "" as surely as the vine
                 Grewv 'round the stump, she loved me,"" that old sweetheart of mine. And again I feel the pressure of her slender little.hand
                 As we used to talk together of the future we had planned. When I should be a poet, and with nothing else to do
                 But to write the tender verses that she set the music to.
                 When we  live together in a cozy little cot Hid in a nest of roses, with a tiny garden spot,
                 Where the vines were ever fruitful and the weather ever fine,
                 And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine. When I should be her lover forever and a day,
                 And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray;
                 And we should be so happy that when either s lips were dumb They should not smile in heaven till the other s kiss had come. But, ah, my dream is broken by a step upon the stair.
                 And the door is softly opened, and my wife is standing there; Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign
                 To meet the living presence of that old sweetheart of mine",poetry

                 T HERE is no song like au old song
                 That we have not heard for years; Each simple note appears to throng With shapes that  in tears.
                 It may have been a cheerful strain,
                 But 'twas so long ago
                 That glee, grown old, has turned to pain,
                 And mirth has turned to woe.
                 There is no friend like an old friend,
                 Whose life-path mates our own,
                 Whose dawn and noon, whose eve and end
                 Have known what we have known. It mav be when we read his face
                 We note a trace of care,
                 'Tis well that friends in life s last grace
                 Share sighs as smiles they share.
                 There is no love like an old love;
                 A lost, maybe, or dead
                 Whose place, since she has gone above,
                 No other fills instead.

                 For life were drear if so,
                 But that first love has roots that grew
                 Where others cannot grow.
                 There are no days like old days,
                 When we, not they, were young,
                 When all life s wavs were golden rays
                 And wrong had never stung.
                 Dear heart! if now outr steps could pass
                 Through paths of childhood s morn, And the dew of youth lie on the grass
                 Which Time's fell scythe has shorn !
                 Old song, old friend, old love, old days
                 Old things, yet never old
                 A stream that s dark till sunshine plays
                 And changes it to gold;

                 ANOTHER hand is beckoning us,
                 Another call is given;
                 And glows once more with Angel-steps
                 The path which reaches Heaven.
                 Our young and gentle friend, whose smile
                 Made brighter summer hours, Amid the frosts of autumn time
                 Has left us with the flowers.
                 No paling of the cheek of bloom
                 Forewarned us of decay;
                 No shadow from the Silent Land
                 Fell round our sister s way.
                 The light of her young life went down,
                 As sinks behind the hill
                 The glory of a setting star,-
                 Clear, suddenly, and still.
                 As pure and sweet, her fair brow seemed
                 Eternal as the sky;
                 And like the brook s low song, her
                 voice,-
                 A sound which could not die.
                 And half we deemed she needed not
                 The changing of her sphere,
                 To give to Heaven a Shining One,
                 Who walked an Angel here. The blessing of her quiet life
                 Fell on us like the dew;
                 And good thoughts, where her footsteps
                 pressed
                 Like fairy blossoms grew.
                 Sweet promptings unto kindest deeds
                 Were in her very look;
                 We read her face, as one who reads
                 A true and holy book.
                 The measure of a blessed hymn,
                 To which our hearts could move; The breathing of an inward psalm;
                 A canticle of love.
                 We miss her in the place of prayer,
                 And by the hearth-fire s light;
                 We pause beside her door to hear
                 Once more her sweet ""Good-night !"" There seems a shadow on the day,
                 Her smile no longer cheers;
                 A dimness on the stars of night,
                 Like eyes that look through tears.
                 Alone unto our Father's will
                 One thought hath reconciled;
                 That He whose love  ours,
                 Bath taken home his child.
                 Fold her, 0 Father! in thine arms,
                 And let her henceforth be A messenger of love between
                 Our human hearts and thee.
                 Still let her mild rebuking stand
                 Between us and the wrong,
                 And her dear memory serve to make
                 Our faith in goodness strong.
                 And grant that she who, trembling here
                 Distrusted all her powers,
                 May welcome to her holier home
                 The well-beloved of ours",poetry

                 Snowy pillows yet unpressed, See the forms of little ,
                 Kneeling, -robed, for their rest. All in quiet nursery ,
                 While the dusky shadows creep, Hear the voices of the children-
                 ""1 Now I lay me down to sleep."" In the meadow and the mountain
                 Calmly Phine the winter stars,
                 But across the glistening low-lands
                 Slant the moonlight s Filver bars. In tho silence and the darkness,
                 DarkneFs growing still more deep, Lieten to the little children,
                 Praying God their souls to keep. ""If we die""-so pray the children,

                 Walking evermore in white.
                 Little Fouls, that stand expectant,
                 Listening at the gates of life, Hearing, far away, the murmur
                 Of the tumult and the strife;
                 We who fight beneath those banners,
                 Meeting ranks of f&amp;eman there, Find a deeper, broader meaning
                 In your simple vesper prayer.
                 When your bands shall grasp the standard
                 W.hich to-day you watch from far,
                 When your deeds shall shape the conflict
                 In this universal war,
                 Pray to him, the God of battles,
                 Whose strong eye can never sleep, In the warring of temptation,
                 Firm and true your souls to keep. When the combat ends, and slowly
                 Clears the smoke from out the skies, When, far down the purple distance,
                 All the noise of battle dies,
                 When the last night s solemn shadows
                 Settle dark on you and me,
                 Blay the love that never faileth
                 Take our souls Eternally.

You've a neat little wife at home, John,
As sweet as you'd wish to see;
As faithful and gentle-hearted,
As fond as wife can be;
Agenuine, home-loving woman,
Not carong for fuss and show;
she's dearer to you than life, John;
Then kiss her and tell her so.
Your dinners are promptly served, John,
As, likewise, your breakfast and tea;
Your wardrobe is always in order,
With buttons where buttons should be.
Her house is a cosy home-nest, John,
A heaven of rest below:
You think she's a rare little treasure;
Then kiss her and tell her so.
8he's a good wife and true to you, John,
Let fortune be foul or fair;
Of whatever comes to you, John,
She cheerfully bars her share;
You feel she's a brave, true helper,
And perhaps far more than you know
'Twill lighten her end of the load, John,
Just to kiss her and tell her so.
There's a cross-road somewhere in life, John,
Where a hand on a guiding stone
Will signal one ""over the river,""
And the other must go on alone.
Should she reach the last milestone first, John
'Twill be comfort amid your woe
To know that while loving her here, John,
You nissed her and told her so.

                 -L. Af.
                 I was sitting in my study
                 Writing letters, when I heard:
                 -Please, dear mamma, Mary told me,
                 Mamma mustn't be 'isturbed. But l's tired of the kitty,
                 Want some ozzer fing to do !
                 Writing letters, is 'ou, mamma?
                 Tan't I write a letter, too ? ""
                 ""Not now, darling; mamma's busy,
                 Run and play with kitty now.""
                 No, no, mamma, me wite letter- Tan if 'ou will show me how.""
                 I would paint my darling's portrait,
                 As his sweet eyes searched my face- Hair of gold and eyes of azure,
                 Form of childish, witching grace. But the eager face was clouded,
                 As I slowly shook my head,
                 'Till I said : - I'll make a letter
                 Of you, darling boy, instead."" So I parted back the tresses
                 From his forehea(d high and white, And a stamp in sport I pasted
                 'Mid its waves of golden light. Then I said : "" Now, little letter,
                 Go away, and bear good news,""
                 And I smiled, as down the staircase
                 Clattered loud the little shoes. Leaving me, the darling hurried
                 Down to Mary in his glee:
                 ""Mamma's writing lots of letters.
                 I's a letter, Mary-see ! ""
                 No one heard the little prattler,
                 As once more he climbed the stair, Reached his little cap and tippet,
                 Standing in the entry there.
                 No one heard the front door open,
                 No one saw the golden hair As it floated o'er his shoulders,
                 In the crisp October air.
                 Down the street the baby hastened,
                 Till he reached the office door: -I's a letter, Mr. Postman;
                 Is there room for any more ?"" Cause this letter's doin' to papa:
                 Papa lives with God, 'ou know, Mamma sent me for a letter,
                 Does 'ou fink 'at I tan do?""
                 But the clerk in wonder answered:
                 ""- Not to-day, my little man."" Den I'll find anozzer office, Cause I must do if I tan.""
                 Fain the clerk would have detained him,
                 But the pleading face was gone,
                 And the little feet were hastening-
                 By the busy crowd swept on.
                 Suddenly the crowd was parted,
                 People fled to left and right, As a pair of maddened horses,
                 At the moment dashed in sight. No one saw the baby figure-
                 No one saw the golden hair,
                 Till a voice of frightened sweetness,
                 Rang out on the autumn air.
                 'Twas too late-a moment only,
                 Stood the beauteous figure there; Then the little face lay lifeless,
                 Covered o'er with golden hair.
                 Reverently they raised my darling,
                 Brushed away the curls of gold, Saw the stamp upon the forehead,
                 Growing now so icy cold.
                 Not a mark the face disfigured,
                 Showing where a hoof had trod; But the little life was ended-

                 A wife looking out on the glistening sea; A prayer for the loved one far away,
                 And prattling imps 'neath the old roof-tree; A lifted latch and a radiant face
                 By the open door in the falling night; A welcome home and a warm embrace

                 His wife by his side, with her silvered hair,
                 And the open book of God close by. Sweet on the bay the gloaming falls,
                 And bright is the glow of the evening star. But dearer fo them are the jasper walls
                 And the golden streets of the land afar. An old church-yard on a green hill-side,
                 Two lying still in their peaceful rest;
                 The fisherman s boats going out with the tide
                 In the fiery glow in the amber west.
                 Children's laughter and old men s sighs,
                 The night that follows the morning clear, A rainbow bridging our darkened skies,

The tender girl stood in pallid, though mute distress; not a sigh, not a tear escaped her. The idea of death broke so suddenly on her mind, that it checked every mode of utterance, and she gazed upon his countenance as if in a dream. '
                 Death, at any period of life, wears an awful aspect, but never more so than to the youthful heart, whose every step has been that of health and joy, and whose bounding pulse, yet swayed by hope, has never been chilled by the sorrows, or distracted by the -doubts 'and fears, that 'hang over our earthly existence. Thus it was with Emilie; united by the tenderest sympathy to her father, and living, as it were, in a world of music, no wonder that she beheld death with
                 terror, as the destroyer of her all-of happiness. The dying father raised himself on his couch-"" You spoke of refreshment, my daugh. ter; it can still be afforded to my fainting soul. Take these notes, the last that I shall ever pen, and sit down to the instrument. Sing with them the hymn so beloved by your mother, and let me once more hear those tones which have been my delight, my passion, since my earliest remembrance."" Emilie did as she was desired, and it seemed as if she sought a relief from her own thoughts; for after run- ning over a few chords of the piano, she commenced, in the sweetest voice, the following lines:
                 1 Spirit ! thy labor is o er,
                 Thy term of probation is run,
                 Thy steps are now bound for the untrodden shore,
                 And the race of immortals begun.
                 Spirit ! look not on the strife
                 Or the pleasure of earth with regret,-
                 Pause not on the threshold of limitless life,
                 To mourn for the day that is set. ""Spirit ! no fetters can bind,
                 No wicked have power to molest;
                 There the weary, like thee,-the wretched, shall find
                 A haven, a mansion of rest.
                 S spirit! how bright is the road
                 For which thou art now on the wing?
                 Thy home it will be, with thy Saviour and God,
                 Their loud hallelujahs to sing.""
                 As she concluded the last stanzas, she dwelt, for a few moments, on the low, melancholy notes of the piece, and :then waited in silence for the mild voice of her father s praises. He spoke not-and, with something like surprise, she turned towards him. He was laid back upon the sofa, his face, shaded, in part, with-his hand, and his form reposed, as if in slumber. Starting with fear, Emelie sprang toward him, and seized his hand; but the touch paralyzed her, for she sunk senseless by his side. He was gone!

                 Month of my heart! thou  here, With sad and faded leaves to strew
                 The summer s melancholy bier.
                 The moaning of thy winds I hear,

                 And bars of purple clouds appear,
                 Obscuring every western star.
                 Thou solemn month! I hear thy voice;
                 It tells my soul of other days, When but to live was to rejoice,
                 When earth was lovely to my gaze: 0 visions bright! 0 blessed hours!
                 Where are their living raptures now? I ask my spirit s wearied powers -
                 I ask my pale and fevered brow!
                 I look to Nature, and behold
                 My life s din emblems, rustling round, In hues of crimson and of gold -
                 The year s dead honors on the ground: And sighing with the winds, I feel,
                 While their low pinions murmur by, How much their sweeping tones reveal
                 Of life and human destiny.
                 'When Spring's delightsome moments shone,
                 They came in zephyrs from the CVest; They bore the wood-lark s melting tone,
                 They stirred thc blue lake s glassy breast; Through Summer, fainting in the heat,
                 They lingered in the forest shade;
                 But changed and strengthened now, they beat
                 In storm, o er mountain, glen, and glade.
                 'How like those transports of the breast,
                 When life is fresh and joy is new; Soft as the halcyon s downy nest,
                 And transient all, as they are true!

                 What gloom about our way they fling ! Like clouds in Autumn's gusty air,

                 The dreams that each successive year
                 Seemed bathed in hues of brighter pride, At last like withered leaves appear,
                 And sleep in darkness side by side.'

                 Where all will spring to meet us;
                 Where hands are striving as wve come,
                 To be the first to greet us.
                 When the world bath spent its frowns and wrath.
                 And care been surely pressing:
                 Tis sweet to turn from our roving path,
                 And find a fireside blessing.
                 Oh, joyfully dear is the  track. If we are but sure of a welcome back. What do we reck on a dreary way,
                 Though lonely and benighted,
                 If we know there are lips to chide our stay.
                 And eyes that will beam love-lighted! What is the worth of your  ray.
                 To the glance that flashes pleasure:
                 When the words that welcome back , We form a heart s chief treasure I
                 Oh, joyfully dear is our homeward track, If we are but sure of a welcome bark.

THE FARMER.

BY LILLIK K. BARB.

L
The king may rule o'er land and sea,
The lord may livo right royally,
The soldier ride in pomp and pride,
The sailor roam o'er ocean wide,
But this, or that, whate'cr befall,
The Farmer he must feed them all.
11. â¢
The writer thinks, the poet sings,
The craftsmen fashion wondrous things,
The doctor heals, the lawyer pleads,
The miner follows the precious leads,
But this, or that, whate'er befall,
The tanner must feed them all.
BL
The merchant may buy and sell,
The teacher do his duty well,
But men may toil through busy days,
Or men may stroll through pleasant ways,
From King to beggar whate'er befall,
The farmer he must feed them all.
IV.
The farmer's trade is one of worth
He's partner with the sky and earth,
He's partner with the sun and rain,
A id no man loses for his gain,
And men may rise and men may fall,
But the Farmer he must feed them all.
V.
The Farmer dares his mind to speak,
He has no gift or place to seek,
To no man living need he bow;
The man that walks behind the plough
Is his own master, whatever befall,
And sine or beggur he leeds us all.
VI.
God bless the man who sows the wheat.
Who finds us milk, and fruit and meat;
May his purse bo heavy, his heart be light,
His cattle, his corn, and all, go right,
God bless tbe seeds his hands let fall,
For the Farmer he must feed us all.

                 NIGHT.
                 BRY JAMES MONTGOMERY.
                 Night is the time for rest;
                 Hfow sweet, when labors close,
                 To gather round our aching breast
                 The curtain 'of repose:
                 Stretch the tired limb, and lay the head Upon our own delightful bed! Night is the time for dreams;
                 The gay romance of life,
                 When truth that 's  that seems,
                 Blend in fantastic strife
                 Ah! visions less beguiling far
                 Thanj waking  by daylight are.
                 Night is the time for toil;
                 To plough the classic field, Intent to find the buried spoil
                 Its wealthy furrows yield;
                 'Till all is ours that sages taught,
                 That poets sung, or heroes wrought.
                 Night is the time to weep;
                 To wet with unseen tears
                 Those graves of memory, where sleep
                 The joys of other years;
                 Hopes that were angels in their birth.
                 But perished young like things of earth!
                 Night is the time to watch;
                 On ocean s dark expanse,
                 To hail the Pleiades, or catch
                 The full moon s earliest glance,
                 That brings into the home-sick mind All that we loved and left behind. Night is the time for care
                 Brooding on hours misspent, To see the Spectre of Despair
                 Come to our lonely tent;
                 Like Brutus midst his slumbering host, Startled by Caesar's stalworth ghost. Night is the time to muse;
                 Than. from the eye the soul
                 Takes flight, and with expanding Views
                 Beyond the starry pole,
                 Descries athwart the abyss of night The dawn of uncreated light.
                 Sight is the time to pray;
                 Our Saviour oft withdrew
                 To desert mountains far away,
                 So will his followers do;
                 Steal from the throng to haunts untrod, And hold communion there with God.
                 Night is the time for death;
                 When all around is peace,
                 Calmly to yield the weary breath,
                 From sin and suffering cease:
                 Think of IlHeaven's bliss, and give the siTo parting friends:-such death be mine",poetry

                 A free paraphrase of the Germau.
                 To weary hearts, to mourning homes The Angel Patience gently comes: No power has he to banish pain, Or give us back our lost again,
                 And yet, in tenderest love, our dear

                 Our feverish brows with cooling palm To lay the storms of hope and fear, And reconcile lire s smile and tear;

                 And make our own our Father's will! Oh ! thou who  on thy way, With longings for the close of day,

                 I walk my parlour floor,
                 And, through the open door,
                 I hear a foot-fall on his chamber stair;
                 I'm stepping toward the hall To give the boy a call;
                 And then bethink me that-he is not there!
                 I thread the crowded street- A satclell'd lad I meet,
                 With the same beaming eyes and coloured hair;
                 And, as he's running by, Follow him with my eye,
                 Scarcely believing that-he is not there!
                 I know, his face is hid Under the coffin lid;
                 Closed are hid eyes;-cold is his forehead fair.

                 So long watched over with parental care,

                 My soul goes up, with joy, To Him who gave my boy,
                 Then comes the sad thought that-he is not there!
                 When, at the day's calm close, Before we seek repose,
                 I'm with his mother, of'ering up our prayer,

                 For our boy's spirit, though-he is not there'!
                 Not there !-Where, then, is he? The form I loved to see
                 Was but the naiment that he used to wear.
                 The grave, that now doth press Upon that cast-off dress,
                 Is but his wardrobe lock'd ;-he is not there !
                 Ile lives !-In all the past lie lives; nor, to the last,
                 Of secing him again will I despair;
                 In dreams I see him now; And, on his angel brow,
                 I see it written "" Thou shalt ameot me there !""
                 Yes! we all live to God!

                 So help us, thine afflicted ones, to bear,
                 That, in the spirit land,

                 My soul to-day Is far away;
                 Sailing the Vesuvian bay.
                 My winged boat, A bird afloat,
                 Swims round the purple peaks remote,
                 Round purple peaks It sails, and seeks
                 Blue inlets and then crystal creeks,
                 Where high rocks throw, Tlirough deeps below, A duplicated golden glow.
                 Far, vague, and dim,
                 The mountains swim;
                 While on Vesuvius' misty brim,
                 With outstretched hands, The gray smoke stands,
                 O'erlooking the volcanic lands.
                 Here Ischia smiles O'er liquid miles;
                 And yonder, bluest of the isles,
                 Calm Capri waits,
                 Her sapphire gates
                 Beguiling to her bright estates.
                 I heed not if
                 My rippling skiff
                 Float swift or slow from cliff to cliff;
                 With  eyes, My spirit lies
                 Under the walls of Paradise.
                 Under the walls,
                 Where swells and fall
                 The bay s deep breast at intervals,
                 At peace I lie,
                 Blown softly by,
                 A cloud upon this liquid sky.
                 The day, so mild,
                 Is heaven s own child,
                 With earth and ocean reconciled;
                 The airs I feel
                 Around me steal
                 Are murmuring to the murmuring keel.
                 Over the rail
                 My hand I trail
                 Within the shadow of the sail;
                 A joy intense,
                 The cooling sense
                 Glides down my drowsy indolence.
                 With  eyes MEy spirit lies
                 Where Summer sings and never dies-
                 O'erveiled with vines, She glows and shines
                 Among her future oil and wines.
                 Her children, hid The cliffs amid,
                 Are gamboling with the gamboling kid;
                 Or, down the walls, With tipsy calls,
                 Laugh on the rocks like waterfalls.
                 The fisher s child, With tresses wild,
                 Unto the smooth, bright sand beguiled,
                 With glowing lips Sings as she skips,
                 Or gazes at the far-off ships.
                 Yon deep bark goes Where Traffic blows,
                 From lands of sun to lands of snows;
                 This happier one, Its course is run
                 From lands of snow to lands of sun.
                 O happy ship,
                 To rise and dip,
                 With the blue crystal at your lip!
                 O happy crew,
                 My heart with you
                 Sails, and sails, and sings anew!
                 No more, no more The worldly shore
                 Upbraids me with its loud uproar!

                 Two brown heads with tossing curls, Red lips shutting over pearls,
                 Bare feet white and wet with dew, Two eyes black and two eyes blue; Little boy and girl were they, Katie Lee and Willie Grey.
                 They were standing where a brook, Bending like a shepherd s crook,
                 Flashed its silver; and thick ranks Of green willows fringed the banks; Hstlf in thought and half in play, Katie Lee and Willie Grey.
                 They had cheeks like cherries red; lie was taller, 'most a head;
                 She, with arms like wreaths of snow, Swung a basket to and fro,
                 As she loitered, half in play, Chattering with Willie Grey. ""Pretty Katie,"" Willie said,
                 And there came a dash of red
                 Through the brownness of his cheek,

                 ""Boys are weak as well as girls."" Do you think that Katie guessed Half the wisdom she expressed? Men are only boys grown tall;
                 Hearts do n't change much, after al'; And when, long years from that day, Katie Lee and Willie Grey
                 Stood again beside the brook
                 Bending like a shepherd s crook, Is it strange that Willie said, While again a dash of red
                 Crossed the brownness of his cheek, ""I am strong and you are weak; Life is but a slippery steep,
                 Hung with shadows cold and deep; Will you trust me, Katie, dear? Walk beside me without fear? May I carry, if I will,
                 All your burden up the hill?""
                 And she answered with a laugh, "" No, but you may carry half."" Close beside a little brook,

                 The hearth of heme is beaming
                 With rays of rosy light;
                 And lovely eyes are gleaming,
                 As fall the shades of night;
                 And while my steps are leaving
                 The circle pure and bright, A tender voice, half grieving,
                 -Says, "" Don't stay late to-night."" The world in which thou

                 The world of her thou lovest

                 She waits for thy.warm greeting;
                 Thy smile is her delight;
                 Her gentle voice ,
                 Says, "" Don't stay late to-night.""
                 The world is cold, inhuman
                 Wil spurn thee in thy fall; The love of one poor weman

                 Tby children will cling round thee
                 Let fate be dark or bright-
                 At home no shaft will  thee,
                 Then, "" Don't stay late to-night",poetry
