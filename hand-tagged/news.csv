nated. If by any language used in the joint
resolution it was intended to relieve Section 3 of
the act of 1873, embodying Article 29 of the
treaty from its own limitation, or to save the
article itself, I ra entirely satisfied that the in

tention miscarried.
But statutes granting to the people of Canada
the.valoable privileges of transit for their goods
from our ports and over our soil, whioh had been
passed prior to the making of the treaty of 1871,
and independently of it, remained in force ever
since the abrogation of the treaty, and notwith­
standing the refusal of Canada to permit our
fishermen to send their fish to their home market
through her territory in bond, the people of that
dominion have enjoyed without diminution the
advantages of our literal and generous laws.
Without baaing oat complaint npon a violation
of treaty obligations, it is nevertheless true that
such refusal of transit and the other injurious acts
which have been recited, constitute a provoking
insistence upon rights neither mitigated by the
amenities of national Intercourse nor modified
by the recognition of our liberality and generous
consideration.
""The history of events connected with this
subject makes it manifest that tbe Canadian
government can, if so disposed, administer its
laws and protect the interests of its people with­
out manifestation of unfriendliness, and with­
out the nnneighborly treatment of onr fishing
vessels, of which we hare justly eomplained,
and whatever is done on our part should be
done In the hope that tho disposition of the
Canadian government may remove the occasion
of a resort to the additional executive power
now aoutht through legislative action. I am
satisfied that upon the principles which should
govern retaliation, enr intercourse and relations
with the Dominion of Canada furnishes no bet­
ter opportunity for its application than is sug
gested by the conditions herein presented: and
that it could not be more effectively inaugur­
ated than under the power of suspension recom­
mended.""While I have expressed my clear conviction
npon the question of the continuance of Section
2fJ of the treaty of 181, I, of course, fully con­
cede the power and the duv of the Congress, in
contemplating legislative action, to constrne the
term of any treaty stipulation which might,
npon any possible consideration of good faith.
limit such action, end licewise the peculiar pro
priety in the case here presented, of its in
terpretation of ita own language as contained in
the laws of 1873, putting into operation said
treaty, ana or 153 J directing the termination
thereof: and if, to the deliberate judgment of
Congress, any restraint to the proposed legisla
tion exists, it Is to be hoped that the expediency
ox its early removal will do recognized. .
""I desire also to call the attention of Congress
to another subject, involving such wrongs and
unfair treatment to our citizens as in my opin­
ion require prompt action. The navigation of
the great lakes and the immense business and
carrying trade growing out of the same have
been treated broadly and liberally by the United
States government, and made free to all man
kind, vhile Canadian railroads and navigation
companies share in our country's transportation
""upon terms as favorable as are accorded to our
own citizens. The canals and other public
works built and maintained by the government
along the line . of the lakes are made
free to alL In contrast to this con­
dition, and evineing a narrow and ungenerous
commercial spirit, every lock and every canal
which is a public work of the Dominion of
Canada is subject to tolls and charges. By
Article 27 of the treaty of 1S71, provision was
made to secure to the citizens ot the United
States the use of tbe Welland, St Lawrence
and other Canadian canals on terms of equality
with the inhabitants of the dominion, and to
also secure to the subjects of Great Brittain
the use ef .the St. Clair Flats canal on terms of
equality with the inhabitants of the United
States. The equality with the inhabitants of
the dominion which we were promised in the
use of the eanals of Canada did not
secure to us freedom from toils in
their navigation, but we had a right to
expect that we, being Americans and interested
in American commerce, would be no more bur­
dened in regard to the same thtn Canadians en
gaged in their own trade; and the whole spirit
of the concetsion made was, or should have
been, that merchandise and property trans
ported to an American market through these
canals should not be enhanced in cost by tolls
many times higher than sueh as were carried to
an adjoining Canadian market. All our citi
zens, producers and consumers as well as vessel
owners, were to enjoy the equality promised,
and yet evidence has for some time been before
mo v.'umxsB, jurnisnea oy tne .secretary oi
the Treasury, showing that while the tolls
in tbe first instance are the same to all, such
vessels and cargoes as are destined to certain
Canadian ports are allowed a refund of nearly
tbe entire tolls, wniie those bound for American
porta are not allowed any such advantage. To
promise equality and then in practice make it
conditional npon our vessels doing Canadian
business instead of their own. is to fulfill a
promise with the shadow of performance. I re
commend that such legislation be had as will
give Canadian vessels navigating our canals, and
their cargoes, precisely tho advantages granted
to our vessels and cargoes upon Canadian
canais, aua mat mu same oe measured by ex-
actlr the same rule of discrimination.
""The courso I have outlined and the recom
mendations made relate to the honor and dig
nity of our country, and the protection and

preservation of the rights and Interests of all

our people. A government does but nan us
duty when it protects its citizens at home and
permits them to be imposed upon ana ubow
ated by the unfair and overreaching disposition
of other nation. If we invite our people to rely
upon arrangements made for their benefit
abroad, we should see to it that they are not de­
ceived, and if we &amp;ro generous and liberal to a
neighboring country, our people should
reap the advantage of it by a re
turn or tho liberality ana generosity.
'These are subjects which partisanship should
not disturb or confuse. Let u survey ine
ground calmly and moderately, and. hating put
aside other"" means of settlement, if we enter
upon the policy of retaliation, let us pursue it
firmly, with a determination only to subserve
the interests of onr Deode and maintain the
high standard and the becoming pride of Ameri
can citizenship. Groyek ulevelau.

location was made by S. 0. Pickens. pres­

democrats in this pivotal state who would
vote for either Bryan or McKinley, and
since it had been determined to have a

do much to defeat the Chicago ticket and

Comventlon Call.
""To the democrats of the United States:
""A political party has always been de­
fir.ed to be an association of voters to
promote the success of political principles
held in common. The democratic party.
during Its whole history, has been pledged
to promote the liberty of the Individual,
the security of private rights and prop­
erty and the supremacy of the law, It has
alarays insisted upon a safe and stable
money for the people's use. It has in­
stated upon the maintenance of the finan­
cial honor of the nation, as well as upon
the preservation inviolate of the institu­
tions established by the Constitution.
These, its prmnciples. were abandoned by
the supposed representatives of the party
at a national convention recently assem­
bled at Chicago. The democratic party will
therefore cease to exist unless it be pre­
served by the voluntary action of such of
its members as still adhere to the funda­
mental principles. No majority of the
members of that convention, howevei
large, had any right or power to surren­
der those principles. When they undertook
to do so that assemblage ceased to be a
democratic convention. The action taken,
the irregular proceedings and the platferm
enunciated 1w that body were, and are,
so utterly and Indefensibly revolutionary
and ccnstitute such radical departures
from the principles of true democracy.
which sh'ould characterize a sound and
patriotic administration of our country's
affairs. that its results are not entitled tr
the confidence or support of true demo­
crats. For the first time since national
parties were formed there is not before
the American people a platform declaring
the principles of the democratic party as
recognized and most courageously and con­
sistently administered by Jefferson, Jack­
re and Cleveland. nor are there nominees
for the ofices of President and Vice Pres­
ident of the U~nited States pledged to car­
ry those principles into practical effect.
The faithful and true democrats of the
United States are determined that their
prinetple, shall not be ruthlessly monders4
nor the people be deprived of an oppor­
tunity to vote for candidates in accord
therewith.
""Therefore the national democratic parts
of the United States, through its regularil
constituted committee, hereby calls a na­
tional convention of that party for the an.
nouncement of its platform and nomina.
tion of candidate, for the ofices of Presi.

States, and the transaction of such busi­
ness as is incidental thereto, to be held at
Indianapolis Wednesday, the 2d day of Sep­
tember, lN, at 12 o'clock noon, and hereby
requests that the members of the party in
the several states who believe in sound
money and the preservation of lasw and
order, and who are unalterably opposed to
the platform adopted and candidates nom­
inated at Chicago, will select. in such man­
ner as to them shall seem best, a number
of delegates to the same, equal to twice
the number of' electoral vote&amp; to which
such states are respectively entitled.
""Such delegates shall be duly accredited,
according to the usages of the democratic
party. Their credentials shall be forwarded
or delivered to the secretary of this corn­
inittee with all convenient speed, and this
committee will make up and announce the
roll of the delegates entitled to participate
in the preliminary organization of the con­
vention.""
A General Dseussion.
There was a general discussion of the re­
port presented by Mr. Outhwaite, during
which speeches were made by nearly all
members of the committee, who reported
the disaffection over the Chicago platform
and other conditior.s In their respective
states. In these speeches the financial pol­
icy 9f Cleveland. Carlisle and other prom­
inent democrats was praised, and some of
the speakers referred to the manner in
which they, as well as the Supreme Court,
were insulted at the Chicago convention.
Gen. Buckner of Kentucky, as well as
other southern speakers and those from
the west, warned the members from the
western and middle states not to underes­
timate- the silver crusade. Gen. Buckner
made a vigorous speech on the preserva­
tion of democratic principles.
There was also discussion as to the state
laws affecting electoral tickets, but all
such questions were referred to the execu­
tive committee, including the manner in
which delegates were to be relected to the
national convention to be held at Indianap­
olis September 2.
After the adoption of his report. Mr.
Outfiwaite moved that the names of all
committeemen be appended thereto. This
created much enthusiasm. The list was
headed by Chairman Palmer.
A telegram was read from Wilson of Mis­
sissippi not to append his name, as he had
been made committeeman without his con­
sent.
A committeeman for New Jersey was
added to take the place of Mississippi.
On motion of Mr. Outhwaite, Chairman
Palmer was directed to appoint an execu­
tive committee of nine.- who should take
charge of the campaign of the national
democratic party at onice and report at
the general national committee of the new
party at a meeting to be held at Indianap­
Olis Tuesday, September 1, the day preced­
ing the national convention.
By the resolution this executive commit­
tee was directed, at the earliest practicable
day, to issue an address to the democracy
of the country, setting forth Its purpose
and plans.
Telegrams were read from Mayor Ma­
thews of Boston, Wm. S. Foreman, former­
ly a member of the Illinois democratic
state committee, and others, indorsing the
third ticket movement.
Chairman Palmer was authorized to go
cutside of the membership of the nationale
committee in selecting the nine members
of the executive committee.
The general committee, at 10:15, adjourn­

gvernmzent of Ireland. We have before us a ""principle""
whih i not explained by its author or its supporters, and
I will not pledge myself to what I do not understand or to thi
what I cannot approve. In the year 1872 I wrote a letter Po:
to an Irish gentlemau~from which I extract a short sen­
e
tense :-"" To have two legislativesasemnblies-lls.he United re

Bill an occassion for it, I may enter into ferther consideration

the may be ignorant of my views upon it. My vote in the re­

"44","17180009585","in the delusive hope that they would restore public credit, and el
afford relieft to the Governmnent and to the business of the cl
country. d
Those of our public men who opposed the whole ""Ameri­ c
can system "" at its commencement, and throughout its pro­ tl
gress, foresaw and predicted that it was fraught with incalcu­ v
lable mischiefs and must result in serious injury to the best h
interests of the country. For a series of years their wise Ul
counsels were unheeded, and the system was established. It y
was soon apparent that its practical operation was unequal and
unjust upon different portions of the country, and upon the
people engaged in different pursuits. All were equally enti­ 1t
tied to the favor and protection of the Government. It fos. ii
tered and elevated the money power, and enriched the favor­ p
ed few by taxing labor, and at theexpense of the many. Its p
effect was to ""make the rich richer and the poor poorer."" t
Its tendency was to create distinctions in society based on
wealth, and to give to the favored classes undue control and u
sway in our Government. It was an organized money power, s
which resisted the popular will, and sought to shape and con­ r
trol the public pdlicy.
Under the pernicious workings of this combined system of t
measures, the country witnessed alternate seasons of tempo­
rary apparent prosperity; of sudden and disastrous commer­ s
cial revulsions; of unprecedented fluctuation of prices, and c
depression of the great interests of agriculture, navigation,
and commerce; of general pecuniary suffering, and ot filial
bankruptcy of thousands. After a severe struggle of imore
than a quarter of a century, the system was overthrown. i
The bank has been succeeded by a practical system of fi­ I
nance, conducted and controlled solely by the Government.
The constitutional currency has been restored; the public cre­
dit maintained unimpaired, even in a period of foreign war; I
and the whole country has become satisfied that banks, Na t
tional or Stare, are not necessary as fiscal agents of the Gov­
ernment. Revenue duties have taken the place of the protec­
tive tariff. T'he distribution of the money derived from the i
sale of the pulice lands has been abandoned, and the corrupt­ 4
ing system of internal improvements, it is hoped, has been
effectually checked.
It is not doubted that if this whole train of measures, de­ I
signed to take wealth from the many and bestow it upon the
few, were to prevail, the effect would be to change the entire i
character of the Government. One only danger remains. It I
is the seductions of that branch of the system which consists l
in interval improvements, holding out, as it does, inducements
to the people of particular sections and localities to embark the 1
Government in them without stopping to calculate the inevita­
ble consequences. This branch of the system is so intimately I
combined and linked with the others, that as surely as an el­ I
feet is produced by an adequate cause, if it be resuscitated and
revived, and firmly established, it requires no sagacity to fore­
see that it will necessarily and speedily draw after it the re­
establishment of a national bank, the revival of a protective
tariff, the distribution of the land money, and not only the i
postponement to the distant future of the payment of the pre­
sent national debt, but its annual increase.
I entertain the solemn conviction that if the internal im­ t
provement branch of the "" American system"" be not firmly
resisted at this time, the whole series of measures composing
it will be speedily re-established, and the country be thrown
back from its present high state of prosperity, which the exist­
ing policy has produced, and be destined again to witness all
the evils, commercial revulsions, depression of prices, and pe­
cuniary embarrassments through which we have passed dur­
ing'the last twenty-five years.
To guard against consequences so ruinous is an object of
high national importance, involving, in my judgmuent, the con­
tinued prosperity of the country.
I have felt it to be an imperative obligation to withhold
my constitutional sanction from two bills which had passed
the two Houses of Congress, involving the principle of the
internal improvement branch of the ""American system,"" and
conflicting in their provisions with the views here expressed.
This power, conferred upon the President by the constitu­
tion, I have on three occasions, during my administration of
the Executive Department of the Government, deemed it my
duty to exercise ; and on this last occasion of making to Con,­
gress an annual communication "" of the state of the Union,""
Sit
is not deemed inappropriate to review the principles and cen­
siderations which have governed may action. I deem this the
I mere necessary, because, after the lapse of nearly sixty years
s;:nce the adoption of the constitution, the propriety of the ex­
i
ercise of this undoubted constitutional power by the P'resident
Shas
for the first time been drawn seriously in question by a
portion of my fellow-citizens.
The constitution provides that '"" every bill which shall have
I passed the ]lou""e of Representatives and the Senate shal!,
lIefore it become a law, be presented to the President of the
SUnited States; if he approve, he a/sall sign it, but if riot, he
Sohill return it, with his objections, to that [louse in which it
shall have originated, who shall enterthe objections at large on
Stheirjournal and tlroceed to reconsider it.""
' The preservation of the constitution from infraction is the
I President's hiobest duty. lie is bound to discharge that duty,
at whatever hazard of incurring the displeasure of those who
may differ with him in opinion. He is bound to discharge it,
as well by his obligations to the people who have clothed him
with his exalted trust, as by his oath of office, which he may
not disregard. Nor are theobligations of the P'resident in any
degree lessened by the prevalence of views different from his
own in one or both houses of Congress. Itis not alone hasty
and inconsiderate legislation that he is required tocheck; but if
at any time Congress shall, after apparently full deliberation,
resolve on measures which he deems subversive of the consti­
tution, or of the vital interests of the country, it is his solemn
duty to stand in the breach and resist them. The President
is bound to approve; or disapprove, every bill which passes
Congress and is presented to him for his signature. The con­
stitution makes this his duly, and he cannot escape it if he
would. He has no election. In deciding upon any bill pre­
sented to him, he must exercise his own best judgment. If he
cannot approve, the constitution commands him to return the
bill to the House in which it originated, with his objections;
I and if he fail to do this within ten days, (Sundays excepted,)
it shall become a law without his signature. Right or wrong,
he may be overruled by a vote of two-thirds of each House ;
and, in that event, the bill becomes a law without his sanction.
If his objections be not thus overruled, the subject is only
postponed, and is referred to the States and the people for
their consideration and decision. The President's power is
negative merely, and not affrmative. He can enact no law.
[ The only effect, therefore, of his withholding his approval of
a bill passed by Congress is to suffer the existing laws to re­
main unchanged, and the delay ccasioned is only that re­
r
quired to enable the States and the people to consider and act
upon the subject in the election of public agents who will carry
f
out their wishes and instructions. Any attempt to coerce the
President to yield his sanction to measures which he cannot
approve would be a violation of the spirit of the constitution,
palpable and flagrant; and, if successful, would break down
the independence of the executive department, and make the
r
President, elecled by the people, and clothed by the constitu­
tion with power to defend their rights, the mere instrument of
I a majority of Congress. A surrender, on his part, of the
powers with which the constitution has invested his office,
I would efrect a practical alteration of that instrument, without
resorting to the prescribed process of amendment.
With the motives or considerations which may induce Con­
gress to pass any bill the President can have nothing to do.
He must presume them to be as pure as his own, and look
only to the practical effect of their measures when compared
I with the constitution or the public good.
f But it has been urged by those who object to the exercise
of this undoubted constitutional power, that it assails the re­
presentative principle and the capacity of the people to govern
themselves; that there is greater safety in a numerous repre­
sentative body than in the single Executive created by the
constitution, and that the executive veto is a ""one-man pow­
Sr,"" despotic in its character. To expose the fallacy of this
objection, it is only necessary to consider the frame and true
character of our system. Ours is not a consolidated empire,
a but a confederated Union. s The States, before the adoption
of the constitution, were co-ordinate, co-equal, and separate
a independent sovereignties, and by its adoption they did not
lose that character. They clothed the Federal Government hith certain powers and reserved all others, including their
own sovereignty, to themselves. They guarded their own Ri
rights as States and the rights of the people by the very limi­ tie
tations which they incorporated into the federal constitution, he
whereby the different departments of the General Govern­ let
ment were checks upon each other. That the majori­ m
ty should govern is a general iprinciple controverted by none;
but they must govern according to the constitution, and not sh
according to an undefined anti unrestrained discretion, whereby it
they may oppress the minority. Jo
The people of the United States are not blind to the fact that re
they may be temporarily misled, and that their representatives, th
legislative and executive, may be mistaken or influenced in st:
their action by improper motives. They have therefore inter­ tr
posed between themselves and the laws which may be passed a
by their public agents various representations, such as assem­ at
bhlies, senates, and governors in their several States ; a House th
of Representatives, a Senate, and a President of the United th
States. The people can by their own direct agency make no lu
law; nor can tile House of Representatives immediately elect. ti.
ed by them; nor can the Senate ; nor can both together, F
without the concurrence of the President, or a vote of two­ in
thirds of both Houses. si
Happily for themselves, the people, in framing our admira­ Ic
ble system of government, were conscious of the infirmities
of their representatives ; arid, in delegating to them the power P
of legislation, they have fenced them around with checks, a
to guard against the effects of hasty action, of error, of combi. Ic
nation, and of possible corruption. Error, selfishness, and S
faction have often sought to rend asunder this web of checks, to
and subject the Government to the control of fanatic and sinis­ ri
ter influences; but these efforts have only satisfied the people ii
of the wisdom of the checks which they have imposed, anrd of pt
the necessity of preserving them unimpaired. S
The true theory of our system is not to govern by the acts er
or decrees of any one set of representatives. The constitu­ as
tion interposes checks upon all branches of the Government, l
in order to give time for error to be corrected, and delusion to tI
p::ss away ; but if the people settle down into a firm convic­ hb
lion ditl'rent from that of their representatives, they give au
eltict to their opinions by changing their public servants. The dt
checks which the people imposed on their public servants in it
the adoption of the constitution are the best evidence of their d
capacity for self-government. They know that the men whom v
they elect to public stations are of like infirmities and passions
with themselves, and not to be trusted without being restricted a
by coordinate authorities and constitutional limitations. Who S
that has witnessed the legislation of Congress for the last thirty n
years will say that he knows of no instance in which mea­ it
sures not demanded by the public good have been carried ! v
1Wo will deny that in the State Governments, by combina­ n
tiots of individuals and sections, in derogation of the general e
interest, banks have been chartered, systems of internal im­ d
provement adopted, and debts entailed upon the people, re­ a
i
pressing their growth, and impairing their energies for years a
to tome 5
After so much experience it cannot be said that absolute b
I urahecked power is safe in the hands of any one set of repre­
sertatives, or that the capacity of the people for self-govern­ u
mont, which is admitted in its broadest extent, is a conclusive v
argument to prove the prudence, wisdom, and integrity of s
f
their representatives.
The people, by the constitution, have commanded the Pre­ v
sident, as much as they have commanded the legislative branch ti
l
of the Government, to execute their will. They have said to c
him in the constitution, which they require he shall take a
I
solemn oath to support, that if Congress pass any bill which t
he cannot approve, ""he shall return it to the House in which
it originated, with his objections."" In withholding from it s
his approval and signature he is executing the will of the people t
constitutionally expressed, as much as the Congress that pass­ v
ed it. No bill is presumed to he in accordance with the popu­ d
lar will until it shall have passed through all the branches of c
the Government required by theconstitution to make it a law.
A bill which passes the House of Representatives may be re­
. jected by the Senate ; and so a bllI passed by the Senate may i
hbe rejected by the House. In each case the respective houses t
exercise the veto power on the other.
SCongress, and each Houso of Congress, hold, under the
constitution, a check upon the President, and he, bythe pow­
er of the qualified veto, a check upon Congress. When
e
the President recommends measures to Congress, he avows,
in the most solemn firm, his opinions, gives his voice in their
t favor, and pledges himself, in advance, to approve them, if
s passed by Congress. If he acts without due consideration,
or has been influenced by improper or corrupt motives ; or if,
e
from any other cause, Congress, or either House of Congress,
shall differ with him in opinion, they exercise their veto upon
his recommendations, and reject them; and there isno appeal
from their decision but to the people at the ballot-box. These
I are proper checks upon the Executive, wisely interposed by
the constitution. None will be found to object to them, or
to wish them removed. It is equally important that the con­
stitulional checks of the executive upon the legislative branch
a
should be preserved.
If it be said that the Representatives in the popular branch
of Congress are chosen directly by the people, it is answered,
the people elect the President. If both Houses represent the
State., and the people, so does the Proeitent. The President
represents in the executive department the whole people of
n
the Unitrd States, as each member of the legislative depart­
ment represents portions of them.
Ii The doctrine of restriction upon legislative and executive
power, while a well-settled public opinion is enabled within a
reasonable time to accomplish its ends, has made our country
what it is, and hass opened to us a career of glory and happi­
if ness to which all other nations have been strangers.
In the exercise of the power of the veto, the President is
responsible, not only to an enlightened public opinion, but to
d the people of the whole'Union, who elected him, as the ren­
d resentatives in the legislative branches, who differ with him
ein opinion, are responsible to the people of particular States,
j or districts, wbo compose their respective constituencies. To
deny to the ]'resident the exercise of this power would be to
repeal that provision of the constitution which confers it upon
,f
him. To charge that its exercise unduly controls the legis.
v lative will is to complain of the constitution itself.
If the Presidential veto be objected to upon the ground that
it checks and thwarts the public will, upon the same principle
r.
the equality of representation of the States in the Senate
e sholrtld be stricken out of the constitution. The vote of a
:s
Senator from Delaware has equal weight in deciding upon the
- most important measures with the vote of a Senator from
it
New York; and yet the one represents a State containing,
a according to the existing apportionment of Representatives in
tile House of Representatives, but one-thirty-fourth part of
the population of the other. By the constitutional compo­
,,ilion of the Senate a majority of that body from the smaller
States represent less than one-fourth of the people of
e the Union. There are thirty States; and, under the ex­
it isting apportionment of representativfes, there are two hun­
Sdred and thirty members in the House of Representatives.
Sixteen of the smaller States are represented in that House
ic by but fifty members, and yet the Senators from these States
i,
constitute a majeriry of the Senate. So that the President
is may recuiuumuu a jirastre to uongreos, ania it may receive
, the sanction and approval of more than three-fourths of the
en House of Representatives, and of all the Senators from the
y large States, containing more than three-fourths of the whole
y population of the United States, and yet the measure may be
s defeated by the votes of the Senators from the smaller States.
:y
None, it is presumed, can be found ready to change the or­
if ganization of the Senate on this account, or to strike that
, body practically out of existence by requiring that its action
j. shall be conformed to the will of the more numerous branch.
n Upon the same principle that the veto of the President
It should be practically abolished, the power of the Vice Presi­
~ silent to give the casting vote upon an equal division of the
. Senate should be abolished also. The Vice Presidentexer­
e cises the veto power as effectually by rejecting a bill by his
casting vote as the President does by refusing to approve and
e sign it. This power has been exercised by the Vice Presi­
1e
dent in a few instances, the most important of which was the
rejection of the bill to recharter the Bank of the United
States in 1811. It may happen that a bill may be passed by
a large majority of the House of Representatives, and may
be supported iby the Senators from the larger States, and the
Vice President may reject it by giving his vote with the Se­
nators from the smaller States, and yet none, it is presumed,
,r
are prepared to deny to him the exercise of this power under
s the constitution.
But it is, in point of fact, untrue that an act passed by
,f Congress is conclusive evidence that it is an emanation of the
popular will. A majority of the whole number elected to each
House of Congress constitutes a quorum, and a majority of
that quorumis coimpetent to pass laws. It might happen that
a quorum of the House of Representatives, consisting of a
e single member more than half of the whole number elected to
t that House, might pass a bill by a majority of a single vote,
and in that case a fraction more than one fourth of the people
n of the United States would be represented by those who voted
a for it. It might happen that the same bill might be passed by
p.
a majority of one of a quorum of the Senate, composed of
of
Senators from the fifteen smaller States, and a single Senator
te
from a sixteenth State, and if the Senators voting for it hap­
pened to be from the eight of the smallest of these States, it
at
would be passed by the votes of Senators from States having
but fourteen Representatives in the House of Representatives,
a and containing less than one-sixteenth of the whole population
. of the United States.
ik This extreme cahs is stated to illustrate the fact that the
td mere passage of a bill by Congress is no conclusive evidence
that those whp passed it represent the majority of the people
se
of the United States, or truly reflect their will If such an
e
extreme case is not likely to happen, cases that approximate
rit
are of constant occurrence. It is believed that not a single
e­ law has been passed, since the adoption of the constitution,
ae
upon which all the members elected to both Houreshavebeen
. present and voted. Many of the most important acts which
,i have passed Congress have been carried by a close vote in
e thin Houses. Many instances of this might' be given. In­
deed, our experience proves that many of the most important
in
acts of Congress are postponed to the last days, and often the
to
last hours of a session, when they are disposed of in haste,
t and by Houses but little exceeding the number necessary to
at form a quorum. Besides, in most of the States the members of the House of pa
Representatives are chosen by pluralities, and not by majori­ ial
ties of all the voters in their respective districts ; and it may bkh
happen that a majority of that House may be returned by a be
less aggregate vote of the people than that received by the ed
minority. nu
If the principle insisted on be sound, then the constitution
should be so changed that no bill shall become a law unless
it is voted for by members representing in each House a ma­ he
jority of the whole people of the United States. We mut t i
remodel our whole system, strike down and abolish not only cti
the salutary checks lodged in the Executive branch, but must IM
strike out and abolish those lodged in the Senate also, and
thus practically invest the whole power of the Governmentin
a majority of a single assembly-a majority uncontrolled and as
absolute, and which may become despotic. To conform to
this doctrine of the right of majorities to rule, independent of tai
the checks and limitations of the constitution, we must revo­ fot
lutionize our whole system. We must destroy the constitu­
tional compact by which the several States agreed to form a on
Federal Union, and rush into consolidation, which must end ch
in monarchy. or despotism. No one advocates such a propo­
si!ion ; and yet the doctrine maintained, if carried out, must pt
lead to this result. an
Onte great object of the constitulion in conferring upon the
President a qualified negative upen the legislation of Con­ for
gress was to protect minorities from injustice and oppression im
by majorities. The equality of-their representation in the
Senate, and the veto power of the President, are the consti­ ta
tutional guaranties which the smaller States have that their
rights will be respected. Without thewe guaranties all their tic
interests would be at the mercy of majorities in Congress re­ of
presenting the larger States. To the smaller and weaker
States, therefore, the preservation of this. power, and its ex­
ercise upon proper occasions demanding it, is of vital import­ co
ance. They ratified the constitution, and entered into the
Union, securing to themselves an equal representation with of
the larger States in the Senate ; and they agreed to be bound w,
by all laws passed by Congress upon the express condition, wi
and none other, that they ehould be approved by the Presi­
dent, or passed, his objections to the contrary notwithstand­ w
t ing, by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses. Upon this con­ m
r
dition they have a right to insist, as a part of the compact to
a
which they gave their assent. hi
A bill might hbe passed by Congress against the will of the
I whole people of a particular State, and against the votes of its lo
I Senators and all its Representatives. However prejudicial it
r
might he to the interest of such State, it would be bound by it ut
if the President shall approve it, or it should be passed by a dE
vote of two-thirds of both Houses; but, it has a right to de­ w
mand that the President shall exercise his constitutional pow­
er, and arrest it, if his judgment is against it. If he surren re
der this power, or fail to exercise it in a case where he cannot et
approve, it would make his formal approval a mere mockery, I
s
and would Ie itself a violation of the constitution, and the dig­ w
senting State would become bound by a law which had not
e
been passed according to the sanctions of the constitution. g
- The objection to the exercise of the ccto power is founded c
- upon an idea respecting the popular will, which, if carried out,
e
would annihilate State sovereignty, and substitute for the pre­
f sent Federal Government a con-olidation, directed by a sop­ S
posed numerical majority. A revolution of the Government 0
would be silently effected, and the States would be sul.jected C
t to laws to which they had never given their constitutional
a
consent. b
a The Supreme Court of the United States is invested with
the power to declare, and has declared, acts of Congress pass­ c
h
ed with the concurrence of the Senate, the House of Repre­ u
it
sentatives, and the approval of the President, to be unconsti­
e tutional and void ; and yet none, it is presumed, can be found, S
who will be disposed to strip this highest judicial tribunal un­ b
der the constitution of this acknowledged power-a power ne­
rf
cessary alike to its independence and the rights ct individuals. e
For the same reason that the Executive veto should, ac­
cording to the doctrine maintained, be rendered nugatory, and It
y
be practically expunged from the constitution, this power of a
a the court should also be rendered nugatory and he expunged,
because it restrains the legislative and executive will, and be­ C
e cause the exercise of such a power by the court may be re­
t­
garded as beins in conflict with the capacity of the people to e
n govern themselves. Indeed, there is more reason for striking
r, this power of the court from theronslitution than thereisthat ti
ir
of the qualified veto of the President ; because the decision of a
if the court is final, and can never be reversed, even though both
a,
Houses of Congress and the President should hbe unanimous e
f, in opposition to it; whereas the veto ofthe Presidentemay be
e,
overruled by a vote of two thirds of both Houses of Congress, t
n or by the people at the polls. a
at
it is obvious that, to preserve the Eys!em established by the
te constitution, each of the co-ordinate branches of the Govern­
iy ment-the executive, legislative, and judicial-must be left
or
in the exercise of its appropriate powers. If-the executive or
a­
the judicial branch be deprived of powers conferred upon
:h
either as checks on the legislative, the preponderance of the
latter will become disproportionate and absorbing, and the
:h
others impotent for the accomplishment of the great objects for
d,
which they were established. Organized as they are by the
ie constitution, they work together harmoniously for the public
nt
good. If the Executive and the Judiciary shall be deprived of
of the constitutional powers invested in them, and of their due
t­ proportions, the equilibrium of the system must be destroyed,
and consolidation, with the most pernicious results, must en­
re
sue---a consolidation of unchecked despotic power exercised by
a majorities of the legislative branch.
ry
The executive, legislative, and judicial, each constitutes a
i­ separate co-ordinate department of the Government ; and each
is independent of the others. In the performanceef their re­
is spective duties under the constitution, neither can, in its legiti
to
mate action, control the others. Tlrhes each act upon their se­
a­
veral re.ponsibilities in their respective spheres; but if the
m doctrines now maintained be correct, the executive must be­
s, come practically subordinate to the legislative, and the judi­
o ciary must become subordinate to both the legislative and the
to executive ; and thus the whole power of the Government
in would be merged in a single department. Whenever, if ever,
s­
this shall occur, our glorious system of well-regulated self-go­
vernment will crumble into ruins-to be succeeded, first, by
at anarchy, and finally by monarchy or despotism. I am far
le from believing that this doctrine is the sentimer.t of the Ame­
te rican people ; and during the short period which remains in
a which it will be tin duty to admiristler the Executive Depart­
3e
ment, it will be my aim to maintain its independence andi dis­
m charge its duties, without infringing upon the powers or duties
g,
of either of the other departments of the Government.
in
The power of the Executive veto was exercised by the first
of and most illuslrious of my predecessors, and by four of his
- successors who preceded me in the administration of the Gov­
er emnment, and, it is believed, in no instance prejudicially to the
of pubiicinterests. It has never been, and there is but little
x­
danger that it ever can ire, abused. No President will ever
n­ desire, unnecessarily, to place his opinion in oppoesition to
s. that of Congrees. He must always exercise the power re­
se
luctantly, and only in cases where his convictions make it a
es matter of stern duty, which hecannot escape. Indeed, there
ot is.more danger that the President, from the repugnance he
ve must always seer to come in collision wita Uonlgres, may Intil
2e to exercise it in cases where the preservation of the constitu­
se
tion from infraction or the public good may demand it, than
de
that he will ever exercise it unnecessarily or wantonly.
)e
During the period I have administered the Executive de­
s. partment of the Government, great and important questions of
Ir­ public policy, foreign and domestic, have arisen upon which
at it was my duty to act. It may indeed be truly said that my
in administration has fallen upon eventful times. I have felt
h.
most sensibly the weight of the high responsibilities devolved
nt upon me. With no other object than the public good, the
i­ enduring fame, and permanent prosperity of my country, I
re
have pursued the convictions of my own best judgment. The
r­ impartial arbitrament of enlightened public opinion, present
is and future, will determine how far the public policy I have
Id
maintained, and the measures I have from time to time re­
ei­ commended, may have tended to advance or retard the public
he
prosperity at home, aiad to elevate or depress the estimate of
ed
our national character abroad.
by
Invoking the blessings of the Almighty upon your delibera­
ry
tions at your present important session, my ardent hope is,
he
that, in a spirit of harmony and concor., you may be guided
r­ to wise results, and such as may redound to the happiness,
d, the honor, and the glory of our beloved country.

Secretary Carlisle stated that it was his

Several members of the committee led

the Secretary what objection there would
be to a system of redeeming notes in gold

""If that policy has been inaugurated at

Mr. Grady, of New York, offered as

the Interest of Japanese-Chinese
Peace - Mr. Clark's Rambling
Speech in the House.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 10.-Mr. Harris
(Demi., Tenn.), president pro tern, called
the senate to crder to-day in the absence
of Vice-President Stevenson, who has not
yet returned from Asheville, N. C., where
he is with his family. Senators Hill,
Blackburn and Carey were in their seats
for the first time this session.
Mir. Call (Dem.. Fla.) presented a reso­
lution setting forth that the independence
of the island of Cuba is an object of great
importance to the United States and re­
questing the president to begin negotia­
tions with Spain for the recognition of the
independence of the island and for the
guarantee of the United States of the pay­
ment of such a sum of money as shall be
agreed on between the United States and
Spain. The resolution went over until to­
morrow.­
iMr. Call also presented a resolution de­
claring that the further prosecution of the
war between China and Japan will not be
advantageous to the peace of civilization
and that the interests of the world require
that all governments shall unite in nego­
tiating with Japan and China for the ter­
mination of the war. Without discussion
the resolution was referred to the Commit­
tee on Foreign Relations.
Mr. Allen (Pop., Neb.) called up his reso­
lution intended to expunge a portion of
the congressional *record and send a reso­
lution introduced by him last July to the
attorney-general. The latter resolution
called for information concerning the Pull­
man strike. This resolution has passed,
but was reconsidered on motion of Mr.
Pugh of Alabama. Mr. Allen bitterly as­
sailed this action and also attacked the at­
torney-general, to whom he attributed the
action of the Alabama senator. Mr. Allen
so criticised the action of the attorney­
general during the strike.
Mr. Pugh (Dem., Ala.) vigorously de­
fended the attitude taken by Mr. Olney
and pointed out what he regarded would
be the impropriety of demanding the infor­
mation asked for in the resolution. He de­
clared that the position of the senator
from Nebraska was unreasonable and un­
tenable. At 2 o'clock the whole matter
went over.
The Nicaragua Canal Bill.
Then, on motion of Mr. Morgan, the sen­
ate took up the Nicaraguan Canal bill,
which was read at length. Mr. Morgan be­
gan his remarks by making a general
statement of the national and international
aspect of the subject, upon which the sen­
ate and house bills agreed. Careful calcu­
lations, he insisted, showed that the canal
could be constructed at a cost that would
yield a remunerative profit; that it was a
necessary improvement; that it would be
of the greatest importance to the United
States; that it could be operated, and there
was nothing to render impossible conces­
sions made by the Central American gov­
ernment to the citizens of the United
States.
The senator devoted some time' to the
discussion of the characteristics of the
country through which it is proposed to
build the canal and its advantageous
route as compared with that of the Pan­
ama canal route and asserted that no such
improvement could be given to commerce
as the construction of this necessary com­
plement to the Suez canal. The route is
feasible, the engineering work easy, and
there will be no extraordinary work re­
quired on any place on the whole route.
Government Must Control It.
Mr. Morgan quoted from the report of
Chief Engineer Menocal, who estimated
that the canal could be built for $65,­
000,000, and said he thought that the
$4.000,000 already spent had demonstrated
that the actual cost would be even lower
than that estimated by Mr. Menocal. The
wvo houses of congress practically agreed
that the cost of the canal would be about
$70.000,000, and the guards and restric­
tions to be thrown around the expenditures
were matters of easy adjustment. The
mzanner of raising the money was a ques­
tion of expediency that should not be al­
lowed to affect its construction. He ar­
gued in support of the proposition that
contemplates government ownership in the
canal. England owned stock in the Suez
canal and why should not the United
States own stock in the Nicaraguan canal?
Government ownership was the only means
by whllich the government could exert its
influence for the protection of its citizens,
exceplt by force. The canal must be built
tnder the fostering care of some govern­
ment. We must act now or abandon the
canal to its fate. To abandon it now was
a responsibility he was unwilling to as­
sume and a dereliction the people would
not forget. At the conclusion of Mr. Mor­
gan's speech Mr. Mitchell of Oregon
briefly expressed his hearty approval of
the scheme to build the canal and said he
thought there was no great difference
among the people regarding the propriety
of the work of construction. The senate
then, at 4:15 p. in., went into executive
session, and at 4:30 p. m. adjourned.

DEFICIENCY OF OVER $&lt;>,000,000
In the Revenue for 18f>7—It I« All
Charged Vp to Secoud-ClasM
Mail Matter.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.—The first
annual report of Postmaster General
James A. Gary, to the president, was
made public tonight. Its feature is
the strong advocacy of postal savings
depositories, as a scheme over which
Postmaster General Gary has worked
for many months in the formulation
of plans to present to the president
and congress. He says the time is ripe
for their establishment, and that the
adoption of a well-organized system
would confer a great boon upon a large
number of people, and ultimately be
of inestimable benefit to the whole
country.
The estimates of the revenues and
expenditures for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 18&amp;9, are: Total postal reve­
nue for 1897, $82,665,462.73; add 5 p«r
cent, $4,133,27:113; estimated revenue for
1898, $86,798,735.86, and 7 per cent. $6,075,­
--911.51; total estimated revenue for 1899,
$92,874,647.37; estimated expenditures
for 1898, $98,922,760; deficiency for 1809,

M^^_'

estimated. $6,045, 112.63. Following is an
abstract of the report: The increase
of the postal deficit for 1897 is largely
a reflection of the depressed business
condition which prevailed all over the
United States during the first three
quarters of that period. There has
been no extravagance of expenditure,
save that obligated by law. Reiterat­
ing the injustice inflicted both upon
the postal revenues and the people by
second-class mail matter carriage regu­
lations, the enactment by congress of
some measure to remedy the wrong,
similarly pointed out by past postmas­
ters general, is urged. As to this the
postmaster general says:
If this were done there would be an end
to postal deficits, and the service could be en­
larged and popularized by a broad extension
of free delivery, without infringement upon
the general resources of the government, and
i veßtually result in the much desired reduc­
tion of letter postage to 1 rent per ounce. No
method of perfecting the organization of the
postal service has proved more effective thau
the consolidation of postofflees. Legislative
restrictions on its development are to be re­
gretted, and a repeal of the five-mile limit
consolidation measure in the 1896 postal ap­
propriation bill is recommended.
The experimental rural free delivery has
been generally appreciated; few expenditures
have conferred greater benefits in proportion,
and it has unquestionably proved a potent
factor In attaining what should be a chief
aim of government, the granting of the best
possible postal facilities to the farming class.
POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
The report reviews in detail the op­
erations of the various branches of the
department. The portion on the sub­
ject of postal savings, in brief, fol­
lows:
Many millions of dollars are undoubtedly
secreted by people who have little or no con­
fidence in ordinary securities and monetary
institutions organized by private citizens. It
is dead capital, but if its owners could be in­
spired with absolute confidence in the se­
curity of an Investment, It is altogether prob­
able that the bulk of this fund would find its
way into the channels of trade and commerce.
If the government undertook this task the
service would undoubtedly be gladly accepted
by the people. Their faith in the government
is unbounded. Their little savings, which
separately could hardly be put out at interest,
would amount, in the aggregate, to a sum
that cou"".d be invested to their advantage.
It would tend to cultivate thrift in a large
class realizing the advantage of depositing
with the government instead of wastefully
and uselessly expending; it would tend io
better relationship; bring Into closer relation­
ship the government and its citizens and de­
veloping practical and enduring patriotism.
This growth of patriotic sentiment and good
citizenship constitute a powerful appeal to
statemanship to make a way for these beuefl­
cent consequences. The proposition Is an ac­
complished fact in nearly every country In
Europe, in the British dependencies of both
hemispheres, and even in Hawaii. In Great
Britain 7,000.000 depositors have upward of
$550,000,000 in savings accumulated during
thirty-five years, and in ten years fewer than
10,000 Hawaiian depositors saved nearly
$1,000,000. Deposits in Canada in twenty years
exceeded $22,000,000. These vast accumula­
tions have been made with the least possible
loss to the governments which guarantee their
repayment, and with a minimum of cost to
the millions of depositors. More than a thou­
sand postal savings accounts in European of­
fices are held by minors and over two-third 9
by the most humble callings. It is essentially
the bank of this class. Postal savings would
not conflict with those savings banks, but
would encourage savings rather than accumu­
lations. The conversion of money order of­
fices into savings depositories would soon af­
ford indefinitely more facility for receiving
interest-bearing deposits than the Interest­
paying baaks do now. The most aggressive
opponents are among the private institutions
engaged in somewhat similar enterprises,
though associations of the larger cities recog­
nize la it ft valuable feeder to tue financial

currents of the country. Security, and not
the rate of interest, is the primary and essen­
tial condition of such a system; and bonds of
states, counties and municipalities and real
estate furnish an illimitable fund.
Comparing other countries, the post­
master general says nearly every coun­
try permits its most popular coin as
the minimum of deposit, varying from
5 cents in India to $1 in Canada. Max­
imum deposits vary from $285 in
France to $2,241 in New Zealand. De­
posits over the amount ;are non-inter­
est-bearing, and in ""several countries
the surplus is by law invested in na­
tional bonds. Both deposits and ac­
counts are usually small, France made
a profit in 1895 of $170,000 in handling
2,500,000 accounts aggregating $143,000,­
--000, after paying 3 per cent interest.
Great Britain earned a surplus of $83,­
--000 after paying 2^ per cent interest
on $480,000,000, made up of 6,500,000 ac­
counts. The average commission paid
to postmasters is 1 cent per deposit.
An account may be settled and with­
drawn frcm any depository in the
country. The telegraph is coming into
use as a means of withdrawal.

Populists as Silver's Pioneers.
I also appreciate the fact that while dur­
ing all the years since 1873 a large major­
ity of the Democratic party and a con­
siderable minority of the Republican
party have been consistent advocates of
free coinage of silver at the present ratio,
yet ever since the organization of the Peo­
ple's party its members have unanimously
supported such coinage as the only means
of restoring bimetallism. By persistently
pointing out tho disastrous effects of a
gold standard and protesting against each
successive step toward financial bondage
the Populists have exerted an important
influonce in awakening tho publio to a
realization of the nation's present peril.

In a time like this, when a great politi­
cal party is attempting to surrender the
right to legislate for our viows upon the
financial question, and is seeking to bind
the American people to a foreign mone­
tary system, it behooves us, as lovers of
oiii1 country and friends of American in­
stitutions, to lay aside for the present

SucH Differences as May Exist

among us on minor questions in order
that our strength may be united in a su­
premo effort to wrest the government
from the hands of those who imagine that
the nit-ion's finances are only secure when
controlled by a few financiers, and that
national honor can only be maintained by
servile acquiescence in any policy, how­
ever destructive to tho interests of the
people of the United States, which foreign
creditors, present or prospective, may de­
sire to force upon us.

It is a cause of congratulation that we
have in this campaign not only tho sup­
port of Democrats, Populists and Repub­
licans, who have all along believed in
independent bimetallism, but also tho
active co-opcration of those Democrats
and Republicans who, having heretofore
waited for international bimetallism, now
join with us rather than trust the destiny
of the nation to thoso who are holding
out the delusive hope of foreign aid while
the labor secretly for the permanent estab­
lishment of tho single gold standard.

Hopes for Settlement on Fusion.
While difficulties always arise in the
settlement of the details of any plan of
co-operation between distinct political or­
ganizations, I am sure that the advocates
of bimetallism are so intensely in earnest
that they will bo able to devise some
means by which the free silver vote may
be concentrated upon one electoral ticket
in each state. To secure this result, char­
ity toward the opinions of others and lib­
erality on the part of all are necessary,
but honest and sincere friends who are
working toward a common result always
find it possible to agree upon just and
equitable terms. The American people
have proved equal to every emergency
which has arisen in the past, and am
confident that in the present emergency
there will be no antagonism between the
various regiments of tho one great army
which is marching to repel an invasion
more dangerous to our welfare than an
army with banners.

Acknowledging with gratitude your ex­
pressions of confidence and good will, I
am very truly yours, W. J. BRYAN.

Question-His Appeal.
LONDON, NOV. 28.-Parnell's manifesto
to the irish people, which has been waited
for with so much eagerness by all parties,
has been made public. Its publication
was forced upon him by the critical condi­
tion in which, not only he, but the entire
Irish party, was placed by Mr. Glad­
stone's letter to Mr. Morley. Its effect
upon the meeting to be held Monday, at
which it will be decided whether he is to
retain the leadership or not, cannot be es­
timated. The manifesto is as follows:
To the Irish People: The integrity and inde­
pendence of a section of the Irish parliamentary
party having been apparently sapped and de­
stroyed by the wire pullers of the Liberal party,
it has become necessary.for me as leader of the
Irish party to take counsel with you, and, hav­
ing given you the knowledge which is in my
possession to ask your judgment upon a
matter which now solely devolves upon
you to decide. The letter from Mr.
Gladstone to Mr. Morley, written for the purpose
of influencing the decision of the Irish party,
in the choice of their leader, and claiming for
the Liberals and their leaders the right of veto
upon the choice, is the immediate cause of this
address, the purpose of which is to remind
you and your parliamentary representa­
tives, that Ireland considers the indepen­
dence of her party as her only safeguard
within the constitution, and above and
beyond all other considerations whatever. The
threat in that letter, repeated so insolently on
many English platforms and in numerous
British newspapers, that unless Ireland con­
cedes this right of veto to England, she will in­
definitely postpone her chances of obtaining
home rule, compels me, while not for a moment
admitting the slightest possibility of such a loss;
to put before you information which until now,
so far as my colleagues are concerned, has been
solely in my possession, and which will enable
you to understand the measure of loss with
which you ate threatened, unless you consent to
throw me to the English wolves now howling
for my destruction.
WHAT THEY DEMAND.
""In November of last year, in response to a
repeated and long standing request, I visited
DMr. Gladstone, at Hawarden, and received the
details of the intended proposal.of himself, and
his colleagues of the late­ Liberal cabinet, with
regard to home rule in the event of the next
general election favoring the Liberal party. It
is unnecessary for me to do more at present than
to direct your -attention to certain points of
these details, which will be generally recog­
nized as embracing elements vital for your in.
formation, and the formation of your judg ment.
These vital points of difficulty may be suitably
arranged and considered under the following
heads:
1. The retention of Irish members in the im­
perial parliament.
2. The settlement of the land or agrarian dif­
ficulty in Ireland.
S. The control of the Irish constabulary.
4. The appointment of the judiciary, nclud­
intg judges ot the Sunreme court, County court
judges and resident magistrates.
Upon the subject 'of the retention of Irish
members in parliament, Mr. Gladstone told me
-that.the opinion-and the unanimous opinion­
of his colleagues and himsel: recently arrived
at, after most mature consideration or alterna­
tive proposals, was that in order to conciliate
English­ public opinion it would be nec­
essary to reduce Irish representation from
103 to thirty-two. Upon the settlement of
the land question, it was held that this
was one of the questions which must be regarded
as reserved lfrom the control of the Irish legisla­
ture. But at the same time Mr. Gladstone inti-.
mated that, while he would renew his attempt
to settle the 'matter by imperial legislation on
the lines of the land purchase bill of 1886, be
would not undertake to put any pressure upon
his own side or insist upon their adopting his
views-in other and shorter words that the Irish
legislature was not to be given the power of solv­
ingfthe agrarian dilficulty.
With regard to the control of the Irish con­
stabulary, it was stated by Mr. Gladstone that,
in view o1 the necessity of conciliating English
.public opinion he and his colleagues felt that it
would be necessary to leave this force to the
appointment of its officers, under control of the
imperial authority, for an indefinite period,
while funds for its maintenance, paymesnt and
equipment would be compulsorily provided out
of the Irish revenues. A period of ten or twelve
years was suggested as the limit of the time dur­
ing which the appointment of judges and
resident
. magistrates should be retained
in the hands of the imperial authority. I have
now given a short account of what I have gath­
ered of Mr. Gladstone's views, and those of his
colleagues, during the two hours of conversa­
tion at IIawarden, a conversation which, I am
bound to admit, was mainly monopolized by
Mr. Gladstone, and will pass to my own ex­
pression of opinion upon those communications
which represent my views then and now.
PARNELIL'S OWN VIEWS.
With regard to the retention of the Irish
members, the position which I have always
adopted and which I then represented, is that
nith the concession of full powers to
an Irish legislature, equivalent to those
enjoyed by a state of the American
union, the number and position of the
members so retained would become a question
of imperial concern and not of Dressing or im­
mediate importanuce for the interests of Ireland.
But that with the important and all-engrossing
subjects of agrarian reform, constabulary con­
trol and judiciary appointments, left either un­
der imperial control, or totally unprovided for,
would be the height of madness for any Irish
leader to imitate Grattan's example and consent
to disband an army which had cleared the way
to victory, I further undertook to use every le­
gitimate influence to reconcile Irish public
opinioi to the gradual coming into forceof new
privileges, and to the postponements niecessary
for English opinion with regard to constabulary
control and judicial appointments. .But
Istrongly Lisented from the proposed reduction
of the number of members, during the interval
of probation, and I pointed to the absence of
any suitable prospect of land settlement, by
parliament, as a constitutional and overwhelm­
ing drag upon the prospect of permanent p ace
and prosperity in Ireland. At the conclusion
of the interview I was in:ormed that Mr.
Gladstone and all his colleagues were entirely
agreed that, pending a general election, silence
should be absolutely preserved with regard to
any points of difference on the question of the
retention of the Irish members. I have dwelt at
some length upon these subjects, but not, I
think, disproportionately to their importance.
Let me say in addition that if, and when,
full powers are conceded to Ireland over her
own domestic affairs, the integrity, number and
independence of the Irish party will be a matter
of no importance. But until this ideal is
reached, it is your duty and mine to hold fast
to every safeguard.
VITAL-QUESTIONS AT STAkE.
I need not say that the question, the vital and
important question, of the retention of the
Irish members on one hand, and indefinite de­
lay in granting full powers to an Irish legisla­
ture, on the other, gave me great concern. The
absence of any provision for the settlement of
the agrarian question-of any policy-on the
part of the Liberal leaders filled me with con­
cern and apprehension. On the introduction of
the land purchase bill by the government
at the commencement of the last ses­
sion, Mr. Morley communicated with
me as to the course to be adopted.
Having regard to the avowed absence of any
policy on the part of the Liberal leaders and
party, with regard to thematter of the Land bill,
I strongly advised Mr. Morley against any di.­
rect challenge of the principle of state-aided
land purchase, and finding that the fears and
alarm of the English taxpayers to state aid by
the hypothecation of grants for local purposes
in Ireland as a counter guarantee had been as­
suaged, that the hopeless struggle against
the principle of the measure should not
be maintained, and that we should di­
rect our sole efforts, on the second
reading of the bill, to the assertion of the
principle of local control. In this, I am bound
to say, Mr. Morley entirely agreed with me, but
he was at the same time much .hampered, and
expressed his sense of his position in that direc­
tion by the attitude of the extreme section of
his party, led by Mr. Labouchere, and in
a subsequent interview he impressed upon
me the necessity ot meeting the second
reading of the bill with a direct
negative and pasked me to undertake the motion.
I agreed to this, but only on condition that I
was not to attack the principle ot the measure,
but to confine myself to criticism of its details.
I think his was a false strategy, Lut it was the
strategy adopted out of regard to English preju­
dices and radical peculiarities. I did the best
possible under the circumstances, and the sev­
eral days' debate on the second reading con-;
trasts favorably with Mr. Labouchere's re­
cent abortive .attempt to interpose' a di­
rect negative to the first reading of a
similar bill yesterday. Time went on,­ the government allowed their attention
to be distracted from the question of land pur­
chase by a bill comnensating English publicanls,
and the agrarian difficulty in Ireland wus again
relegated to the future of another ses.-ion.
Just before the commencement of this
session I was again falvored with another
interview with Mr. Morley. I impressed
upon him the policy of an oblique method of
procedure with reference to sand purchase, and
the necessity and importance of providing for
the question of local control and of limitation
in the application of funds. He agreed with me,
and Ioftered to move on the first reading of the
bill an amendment in favor of this local control,
advising that, if this were rejected, it
might be left to the Radicals on the second read.
ing to oppose the principle of the measure.
This appeared to be a proper course, and I left
Mr. Morley under the impression that this
would fall to my duty, but in addition he made
me a remarsable proposal.
sMR. MORLEY'S PROPOSAL.
Referring to the probable approaching vic­
tory of the Liberal party at the polls, he sug­
gested some considerations as to the future
of the Irish party and he asked me
whether I would be willing to as­
sume the office of chief secretary for Ire­
land or whether I would allow another member
of my party to take the position. He also put
before me the desirability of filling one of the law
offices of the crown in Ireland by a legal mem­
ber ofmy patty. I told him, amazed as I was
at the proposal, that I could not agree to forfeit
in any way the independence of the party, or
any of its members; that the Irish people bad
trusted me in this movement because the declar­
ation I had made them at Cork, in 1880, was a
true one and represented my conviction, and
that I would on no account depart from it. I
considered that, after the declaration we had re­
peatedly made, the proposal of nMr. Morley
that we should allow ourselves to be absorbed
into English politics. was one based upon an en­
tire misconception of our position with regard
to our Irish constituencies and of the pledges
we had given. In conclusion he di­
rected my attention to the plan of
campaign on estates. He said that it would
be impossible for the Liberal party, when it
attained power, to do anything for these evicted
tenants by direct action, and that it would
also be impossible for the Irish parlia­
ment, under the powers conferred, to do any­
thing for them: and, flinging up his hands with
a gesture of despair, he exclaimed: ""Having
been in Tipperary I do not know what to pro­
pose in regard to the matter."".
I told him this question was a limited one;
that I did not see that he need allow himself to
be hampered by its future consideratlin; that
funds would be available from America trnd else­
where for the support of those tenants as long as
might be necessary; that of course I understood
that it was a difficulty, but that it was a limited
one and should not be allowed to interfere with
the general interests of the country. I allude
to this matter only because, within the last
few days, a strong argument in many minds
for my expulsion has been that, unless the
Liberals come into power at the next general
election the plan of campaign tenants will
suffer. As I have shown, the Liberals propose
to do nothing for the plan of
campaign tenants by direct action
when they come into power, but I am oen­
titled to ask that the existence of these tenants,
whom I have supported in every way in the
past, and whom I shall continue to support in
the future, shall not constitute a reason for my
expulsion from Irish politics. I have repeatedly
pledged myself to stand by these evicted ten­
ants and that they shall not be allowed to suffer,
and I believe that the Irish people, throughout
the world, will support me in this policy. Six­
teen years ago I conceived the idea of an Irish
Parliamentary party, independent of all En­
glish parties. Ten years ago I was elected
leader of the Independent Irish parliamentary
party. During these ten years this party has
remained independent, and because of this in­
dependence it has forced upon the English peo­
ple the necessity of granting home rule
to Ireland. I believe that the party
will obtain home rule, only provided
that it - remains independent of any
English party. I do not believe that any action
of the Irish people in supporting me will en­
danger the home-rule cause, or postDone the
establishment of an Irish parliamenit. But even
if the danger, with which we are threatened by
the Liberal party of to-day, were to be realized,
I believe that the Irish people throughout the
world would agree with me that postponement
would be preferable to a compromise of our na.­
tional rights by the acceptance of a measure
which would not realize the aspirations of our
race. CHARLES STEwART PARNELL.

What Liberals Will Do.
LONDON, Nov. 29.-An important sec­
tion of the Parnellites met in the house of
commons last night and resolved to take
active steps to combat the influence of the
manifesto, resenting its appearance as a
breach of faith. A decision was arrived
at, and the meeting only ad­
journed in order to get the opin­
ion of the delegates in America.
In case the Irish INationalist members, at
their meeting on Monday, favor Mr. Par­
nell, a movement will immediately be
started among the Liberals to give English
reforms precedence over home rule, and a
meeting to advocate reverting to the pro­
gramme of 1885 will be summoned. Sir
William Vernon Harcourt, it is believed,
will succeed Mr. Gladstone in the leader­
ship of the Liberal party in the event of
the latter's retiring.

BECIPROCITY.
The question of renewing a treaty for re­
ciprocal trade between the United States
and the British Provinces, on this conti­
nent, has not been favorably considered by
.5,,a mi,,5,.atron The advantares of such
a treaty would be wholly in favor of the
British Provinces, except possibly a few en­
gaged in the trade between the two sections.
No citizen of the United States would be
benefitted by the reciprocity. Our Internal
Revenue taxation would prove a protection
to the British producer almost equal to the
protection which our manfacturers now re­
ceive from the tariff. Some arrangement,
however, for the regulation of commercial
intercourse between the United States and
the Dominion of Canada may be desirable.
HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY, AND THE NORTH­
WESTERN IOUNDAI Y.
The commission for adjusting the claims
of the Hudson's""Bay and Paget's Sound
Agricultural Company upon the United
States have terminated its labors. The
award of $650,000 has been made, and all
the rights and titles of the company on the
territory of the United States having been
extinguished, the deeds for the property of
the company have been delivered. An ap­
propriation by""Congress to meet this sum is
asked.
The commissioners for determining the
north-western land boundary between the
United States and the British Possessions,
under the treaty of 1856, have completed
their labors, and the commission has been
dissolved.
SUPPREBBION OF THE SLAVE TRADE.
In conformity with the recommendation
of Congress, a proposition was early made
to the British government to abolish - the
mixed courts created under the treaty of
April 7. 1862, for the suppression of the
slave trade. The subject is still under nego.
iation.
THE FRENC CABLE.
It having come to my knowledge that a
corporate Company organized under Brit­
ish laws, proposed to land upon the shores
ot the United States and to operate their
submarine cable under a concession from
his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the
French, of an exclusive right for twenty
years of telegraphic communication be­
tween the shores of France and the United
States, witth the very objectionable feature
of subjecting all messages conveyed there­
by to the scrutiny and control of the
French Government, I caused the French
and British Legations at Washington to be
msade acquainted with the probable policy
of Congress on the subject as foreshad­
owed by the bill which passed the Senate
in March last. This drew from the repre­
sgntatives of the Company an agreement
to accept as the basis of their operations
the provisions of that bill, or of such
enactments on the subject as might be
passed during the approaching session of
Congress; also to use their influence to se­
cure from the French Government,a mod­
ificntion of their concession so as to permit
the landing upon French soil, of any cable
belonglng to any Company incorporated
by the authority of the United: States, or
any State n the Union, and on their part
not to oppose the establishment of any
such cable. In consideration of this agree­
ment, I directed the withdrawal of allop­
position by the United States authorities
to the landing of the cable and to the
working of it-until the meeting of Con­
gress. I regret to say that there has been
no modification made in the Company's
concession, nor so far as I can learn have they attempted to secure one. Their con­ span
cession excludes the capital and the citi The
zoens of the United States from competi­ And
tion upon the shores of France. I recom­ still
mend legislation to protect the rights of has
the citizens of the United States as well as disc
the dignity and sovereignty of the nation poll
against such an assumption. I shall also and
endeavor to secure by negotiation an aban­ ricu
donment of the principles of monopolies cool

A Long-Expected Decision Rendered
by the Commission.
Carriers IMust Use Their Own Judgment in
Interpreting the Law, Subject to Ac.
countability Before the Com.
mission and Courts.
W'ASHINGTON, D). C., June 15.-The Inter­
state Commerce Commission rendered to­
night the long-expected decision upon the
fourth section of the interstate commerce
act, which prohibits a greater charge for the
Sransportation of passengers and property
over a shorter than over a' longer distance
in the same direction, and under substan­
tially similar circumstances and conditions.
The decision is made upon the petition of
the Louisville' and Nashville and other
railroad companies which .were among
the first to apply for relief from
the operation of the fourth section of the
law. The decision is very long, comprising
more than 15,000 words, but the most im­
portant reatureis this announcement by the
com;iission:
The carrier must judge for. itself what are
substantially simliar clrcumstances and coi:­
ditions which preclude a .pecali rate,
rebate or drawback which is made
unlawful by the second section, since
no tribunal in empowered to judge for it
until after tile carrier has acted, .and then
only for the purpose of determining whether
its action constitutes a violation of law. A
carrier judges on the peril or consequences.
but tie special rate, rebate or drawback
which it grants is no, illegal when it turns
out that the circumstances and conditions
are not such as to forbid it; and as Congress
clearly Intended this it must also, when
using the same words in 'the fourth sec­
tlon, have intended that a carrier ,hose
privileges were is some way limited
by them. shoula in the same way act upon
Its judgment of the limiting circumstances
and conditions.
DECISION WITHHELD.
The Commission therefore will not under­
ake to decide in advance what constitutes
•or whas does not constitute a discrimina­
tion ""under substantially similar clr­
cumstances and conditions,"" but will
lesfve the rallroa-l companies in fix­
ing their tariffs to act upon their
own judgment ann at their own risk, subject
to accountability before tile commissior and
courts in cases where complain' is made by
interested parties o"" the violation of law.
For the guidanci, however, of railroad
companies, the commalsln in its decision
has considered,lat greaj length, nearly all
the questions raised unlder the fourth section
of tne law, ann has reached Conclusio0ns
which are summarized as follows:
1. The prohibition of tihe fourth section
against a greater charge ror a shorter than
for a iong>.: listance over the same line in
the same direction, the shorter being Includ­
ed within thle longer distance, as qualifled
therein, Is limited to cases iI which clrcum­
stances and conditions are substantially sim­
liar.
2. The phrase, ""Under substantially
slmilar circumstance and conditions,"" in
the fourth section, is used in the same
sense as in the second section, and
under the qualified form of prohibi­
rion in trs t-ourth section, and carriers
are required to Judae in the first instance
with regard to the similarity or dissimilarity
of the circumstances and conditions that
forbid or nermit a greater charge for a
shorter distance.
3. The judgment of carriers with respect to
circumstances and conditions Is not final,
but subject to the authority of tle commis­
sion and the courts to decide whether
an error has been committed, and
in the case of complaintfor violating the
fourth section of the act the burden of proof
is on the carrier to justify any departure
from the general rule prescribed by the
statute, by showing th'at the circumstances
and conditions are substantially dissimilar.
REASONABLE AND JUST CHARGES.
4. The provisions of sectlon 1. requiring
that cilarge., be reasonable and just, and of
section 2, forbidding unjust discrimination,
apply when exceptional charges are made
unoer section 4, as they do in otller cases.
5. The existence of actual competition,
whicit is of controlling force in respect to
traffic imnortant in amount, may make out
dissimilar circumstances and conditions en­
titling the carrier to charge less for a longer
than tor a shorter haul over the same line in
the same direction, the shorter being
included in the longer in the following cases:
1. When the competition Is with carriers
by water, which are not subject to the pro­
visious of the statute.
2. When the competition is with foreign or
other railroads which are not subject to the
provisions of the statute.
3. In rare and peculiar cases of competi­
tion netween railroads whlg41,:sttreue cjtto,0
the statute, wlen a strict apRl}ca~lq4 g(t the
general rule of the statute Wo~at be der
structive of competition.
6. The commission further decides that
when a greater charge in the aggregate is
made for the transportation of passengers
or like klud of property for a shorter tha, a
longer distance over the same line In the
same direction, the stiorte: being in­
cluded in the longer­ distance, it Is
not sufficient justification therefor that
the traffic which is subjected to suc:' greater
charge is way or local trafflc,and that which
is given the more favorable rates is
not. Nor is it sufficien; justification
for such greater charges that short haul
traffie is more expensive to the carrier, un­
less when the circumstances are such as to
make it exceptionally expensive, or the long
haul traffic s exceptionally inexpensive, the
difference being extraordinary and sus­
ceptible of definite proof. Nor that
the lesser charge on a longer
haul be merely a continuation of
favorable rates under which trade centers
or industrial e tabllshments have been bullt
up. Tea fact that long-haul frafme will only
bear certaln rates is no reason for carrying
it for less than coat at the expense of other
traff.
QUESTIONS CONSIDERED.
In considering the cases governed by the
lrfth conclusion in the above abstract, the
Commuissilan takes up­
1. Competition with carriers by water, and
says:
'""It was fairly shown before us that
instances exist and may be found along the
routes of the petitioners' lines nl the States
of Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama,
Mississippi and Louisiana, where the compe­
titlon of waterways forces down railroad
rates below what it is possible to make them
at non-competitive points and still operate I
the roads with success or efficiency. The only
question which fairly arises in regard to
it is whetner the competition is kept
wlthinaproper bounds. Low rates are a
necessity of t:e sl.uatlon, and if railroads
compete wiih water transportation, either
on ocean or on navigable rivers, they have
no choice but to accept such rates. To com­
pal roads to observe strictly tle general rule
laid down by the tourthsection:would neces­
iltat. toht:r abandonment of some classes of
busino-s in whict their competi.lon
with watec transportation is . now of
public Importance. The railroads must
either be allowed to compete with vessel
owners and make low charges for the pur­
pose, or they must leave Vessel owners in
possession of the business without a check
upon the charges which competition would
afford.""
The commission is of the opinion that Con­
grass hadl these circumstances in view in
passing the law.
DISSIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
The comnmisslon continues:
""'Competition with Canadian roads may,lt Is
believed, present a case of dissimilar circum­
stance, and conditions whenever such roads
compete with roads In the United States for
business between one part of ourcountry and
another. A state of circumstances
arises and exists as to such busi­
ness, which justifles American roads
in meeting such competition by
a corresponding reduction in rates, without
regard to the fact in so doing that rates be­
tween terminals may be reduced below rates
to and from intermediate places, which are
otherwise reasonable and justIn toemselves.
The fact that American roans are left free to
meet such competition is of itself an assur­
ance that no extensive war of rates is likely
to be engaged In by Canadian roads, or if
engaged in, to be long pursued.""
The commission thinks cases ln which
competilion between American roads will
permit a devlation from the long and short
haul clause are very few, but says: ""One
such case is that of a railroad extenoing'
from Pittsburg, Pa., parallel to the Penusyl­
vania Railroad as far as Youngstown; thence
to Ashtabula, 0., a here, through a connec­
tion with tb, Lake Shore, it gives to the
people of Pittsburg and Youngstown comDe­
tition withthe Pennsylvania road in their
business to and from New York and New
England.""
The commission goes on to say that this
route Is somewhat roundabout, but that if
the long an.: short haul clause is construed
strictly it would destroy competition from
Plttsburg, which city furnished the calital
to Dulla it for the express purpose of securing
competition.
SIMILAR SITUATIONS ELSEWHERE.
The commissioun adds: 'Are other roads
simlarly situated? Like certain nprth and
south roads, such as that from CiGcinnati
to Toledo and that from New. Al­
bany to Chicago. when torming links in
east-bound traffic, they make, a ertialler
charge for the longer haul because: their di.
rectlon compels it."" In mentioning these the
commission reserves the freedom to, decide
without prejudice the applications pending
from these roads. The Commissioners say
;hev were unanimous in the opinion,. and
conclude it as follows:
.""The order, for temporary relief made In
)vor of the petitioners will be allowed to remain in force until the day originally 1rm­
Iteri for Its exirlration.""
Other petitions for relief under the fourth
section of the law number, the commission
says, fifty-flve. The temporary orders made
in some of these petitions will in a like man­
ner be permitted to remain In force until the
expiration of the time limited in each. No
further order will be made upon any petitions
Tor relief, although two or three cases
may not, by the facts recited
in the applications for relief, be
brought strictly within the principles above
discussed, yet they all present what are
claimed to be different circumstances. and
conditions adequate to authorize exceptions
to the general rule; and if the petitioners are
persuaded that tile fact Is as they represent,
they should act under the statute accord­

advocates of a universal gold standard and. the
advocates of bimetallism. Between bimetallism
-whether independent or international-and tile
gold standard there Is an impassable gulf.
Is this quadrennial agitation in favor of in­
ternational bimetallism conducted in good faith,
or do our opponents really desire to maintain
the gold standard permanently? Are they will­
ing to confess the superiority of a double stand­
ard when joined in by the leading nations of the
world, or do they still insist that gold is the
only metal suitable for standard money among
civilized nations? If they are in fact desirous
of securing bimetallism, we may expect them
to point out the evils of a gold standard and
defend bimetallism as a system. If, on the
other lhand, they are bending their energies to­
ward the permanent establishment of a gold
standard under cover of a declaration in favor
of international bimetallism, I am justiied in
suggesting that honest money cannot be expected
at the hands of those who deal dishonestly with
the American Deople.
What is tile test of honesty in money? It
must certainly be found in the purcllasing power
of the dollar. An absolutely honest dollar
would not vary in its general purchasing power;
it would be anlsolutely stable when measured by
average prices. A dollar which Increases in
purchasing power is just as dislonest as a dollar
which decreases in purchasing power. Prof.
Laughlin. now of the University of Chicago and
one of the highest gold standard authorities. in
hIls work on bimetallism not only admits that
gold does not remain absolutely stable in value,
but expressly asserts that ""there is no such
thing as a standard of value for future pay­
ments. either In gold or silver, which remains
absolutely invariable."" -He even suggests that
a multiple standard. wherein the unit is
""based upon the selling prices of a number of
articles of general consumption"" would be a
more just standard than either gold or silver,
or both. because ""a long time contract would
thereby be paid at its maturity by the same
purchasing power as was given in the begin­
ning.'
It cannot be successfully claimed that mono­
metallism or bimetallism or any other system,
gives an absolutely just standard of value. Under
both monometallism and bimetallism the govern­
ment fixes the weight and fineness of the dollar.
invests it with legal tender qualities and then
opens the mints to its unrestricted coinage,
leaving the purchasing power of the dollar to
be determined by the number of dollars. Bi­
metr.llism is better than mnonometallism. not be­
cause it gives us a perfect dollar-that is, a dol­
lar absolutely unvarying in its general purchas­
ing power-but because it makes a nearer ap­
proach to stability, to honesty, to justice, than
a gold standard possibly can. Prior to 1873,
when there were enough open mints to permit
all the gold and silver available for coinage to
find entrance into the world's volume of stand­
ard money, the United States might have main­
tained a gold standard with less injury to the
people of this country; but now, when each step
toward a universal gold standard enhances the
purchasing power of gold, depresses prices and
transfers to the pockets of the creditor class
an unearned increment, the influence of this
great nation must be thrown upon the side of
gold unless we are prepared to accept the
natural and legitimate consequences of such an
act. Any legislation which lessens the world's
stock of standard money increases the exchange­
able value of the dollar; therefore crusade against
silver must inevitably raise the purchasing
power of money and lower the money value of
all other forms of property.
Our opponents sometimes admit that it was a
mistake to demonetize silver, but insist that
we should submit to present conditions rxther than return to the bimetallic system. They err
in supposing that we hale it-Aached the end of
the evil results of a gold standard; we have not
reached the end. The injury .i a continuing one,
and no person can say how lohg the world is to
suffer from the attempt to mdake gold the only
stantdard money. The same influences which are
now operating to destroyj silver in the United
States will, if successful here; be turned against
other silver-using countrigs. and each new con­
vert to the gold standard will add to the general
distress. So long as the +.rhmble for gold con­
tinues, prices must fall ind­ a general fall in
prices is but another definitiond of hard times.
I-.
Coinage and Busne_.7s Interests.
Our opponents, while ea-infiig entire disinter­
estedness for themselves,: have appealed to the
selfishness of nearly every class of society. Recog­
nizirng the disposition of the lhdividual voter to
consider the effect of any proposed legislation
upon himself, we present to the American people
the financial­ policy outlined in the Chicago plat­
form, believing that it will result in the great­
est good to the greatest number. The farmers are
opposed to the gold standard because they have
felt its effects. Since they sell at whologale and
buy at retail they have lost more than they have
gained by falling prices; and besides this, they
have found that certain firxd charges have not
fallen at all. Taxes iave not been perceptibly
decreased, although it requires more of farm
products now than formerly to secure the money
i lth which to pay taxes. Debts have not fallen.
The farmer who owed $1,000 is still compelled to
pay $1,000, although it may be twice as dif­
ficult as formerly to obtain a dollar with which
to pay the debt. Rallrfad rates have not.been
reduced to keen pace with falling prices, and
besides these items there are many more. The
farmer has thus found complaint against the
gold standard.
The wage earners have been injured by a
gold standard and have expressed themselves
upon the subject with great emphasis. .In Feb­
ruary, 1805, a petition asking for the imme­
diate restoration of the free and unlimited coin­
age of gold and silver at 10 to 1 was signed
by the representatives of all, or nearly all, the
leading labor organizations and presented to con­
gress. Wage earners know that while a gold
standard raises the purchasing power of the
dollar it also makes it more difficult to obtain
possession of the dollar; they know that em­
ployment is less permanent, loss of work more
probable and reeimployment less certain. A gold
standard encourages the hoarding of money be­
cause money is rising; it also discourages enter­
prlise and paralyzes industry. On the other
hand, the restoration of hinmetallism will dis­
courage hoardlng, because, lwhen prices are
steadytl or rising. money cannot afford to lie idle
in the bank vaults. The farmers and wage earn­
ers together constitute a considerable majority
of the people of the country. Why should their
Interests be ignored in considering financial legis­
lation?
A monetary system which is pecuniarly ad­
vantageous to a few syndicates has far less to
commend it than a system which would give
hope and encouragement to those who create the
nation's wealth. Our opponents have made a
special appeal to those who hold fire and life
insurance pollcies. hut these policy holders know
that since the-total premiums received exceed
the total losses paid, a rising standard must he
of more benefit to .the companies than to the
policy holders.
Much eslicitude has been expressed by our op­
ponents for the depositors in savings hanks. They
constantly parade before these depositors the
advantages of a gold standard; blut these appeals
will be in vain, because savings bank depositors
know that under a gold standard there is in­
creasing danger that they will lose their deposits
because of the inability of the banks to collect
their assets; and they still further know that,
if the gold standard Is to continue indeflnitely,
they may be compelled to withdraw their de­
posits in order to pay their living expenses.
It is bnly necessary to note the increasing
nnmber of failures il order to know that a gold
standard is ruinous to merchants and mnntu­
facturers. These business men do not make their
profits from the people from whom they borrow
money, but frmn the people to whom they sell
their goods. If the people cannot buy, retailers
cannlot sell, and if retailers cannot sell, whole­
sale merchants and manufacturers must go into
bankruptcy.
Those who hold, as a permanent investment,
the stock of railroads and other enterprises-I
do not Include those who speculate in stocks or
use stock holdings as a means of obtaining an
inside advantage in construction contracts-are
injured by a gold standard.-. The rising dollar
destroys the earning power of-these enterprises
without reducing their liabilities, and as divi­
dends cannot be paid until :-salaries and fixed
charges have been satisfied --the stockholders
must bear the burden of. hard-times.
Salaries in business oceupattpns depend upon
business conditions, and-the-gold standard both
lessens the amount and: threatens the perma­
nency of such salaries. Official salaries. except
the salaries of those wlho hold office for life,
must in the long run bo adjutsted to the condi­
tions of those who pay taxes,,jand if the .pres­
ent financial policy continues.­ we must expect
the contest between the taxpayer and the tax
eater to increase in bitterness.
The professional classes-in -thbe main-receive
their support from the prodnleing classes and can
only enjoy prosperity welpn there is prosperity
among those who create iwenlth.
I have not attempted o des&amp;irihe the effect of
the gold standard upon all classes; In fact, I
have only had time to nlention a few: but each
person will bed able to 1apply ""the principles to
his own occnpation. It must also be remembered
that it is the desire of people,, geierally to con­
vert their earnings intoi:real or personal prop­
erty. This being true JnR considering any tem­
porary advantage whichl.may. Some. from a sys­
tem under which the dollar .rises in its pur­
chasing power, it must not be forgotten that the
dollar cannot buy more than formerly unless
property sells for less than formerly. Hence,
It will be seen that a large portion of those
who may find some pecuninary. advantage in a
cold standard will discover that their losses ex­
ceed their gains.
It is sometimes asserted by-our opponents that
a bank belongs to the debtor class, but this
is not true of any solvent bank. Every state­
ment published by a solvent bank shows that
the assets exceed the liability. That is to say,
while the bank owes a large amount of money
to its depositors, it not only has enough on
hand in money and notes to pay its deposit­
ors, but in addition thereto, has enough to cover
Its capital and surplus. When the dollar is
rising in value slowly, a bank may be making
short time loans, and by taking good security
avoid loss: but when prices are falling rapidly.
the, bank Is apt to lose more because of had
debts than it can gain by the increase in the
purchasing power of its capital and surplus. It
must be admitted, however, that some bankers
combine the business of a bond broker with the
ordinary banking business, and these maty make
enough in the negotiation of loans to offset the
losses arising in legitimate banking business.
As lorig as hulian nature remains as it is,
there wiIll always be idanger that lunless re­
strained by the public opinion or legal enact­
ment, those who see if pecuniary profit for them­
selves in a certain condition may yield to tile
temptation to bring about that condition. Jef­
ferson has stated that one of the main duties
of government .f-to prevent men from injuring
one another, and nev-r was that duty more im­
portant than it is to-day. It'is not strange that
those who have made a profit 1i furnishing gold
to the government in the hour of its extremity,
favor a financial policy which will keep the
-government dependent upon them. I believe,
however, tlhat I speak the sentiment of tihe
vast majority of the pIeople of tihe United States

Quotes Slhermnan and Dnlaine.
Let me say a word now in regard to certain
persons who are pecuniarily benefited by a gold
standard and who favor it, not from a desire to
trespass upon the rights of others, but because
tie circumstances which surround them blind
them to tie effect of the gold standard upon
others. I shall ask you to consider the language
of two gentlemen whose long public service and
high standing in the party to which they belong
will protect them from adverse criticism by our
opponents. In 1869 Senator Sherman said: ""The
contraction of the currency is a far more dis­
tressing operation than senators suppose. Our
own and other nations have gone through that
operation before. It is not possible to take that
voyage without the sorest distress. To every
person except a capitalist out of debt, or a
salaried officer or annuitant, it is a. period of
loss, danger, lassitude of trade, fall of wages,
suspension of enterprise, bankruptcy and disaster.
It means ruin to all dealers whose debts are
twice their business capital, though one-third less
than their actual property. It means the fall of
all agricultural production without any great re­
duction of taxes. What prudent man would dare
to build a house, a railroad, a factory or a
barn with this certain fact before him?"" As I
said before, the salaried officer referred to must
be the man whose salary is fixed for life, and not
the man whose salary depends upon business con­
ditions. When Mr. Sherman describes contrac­
tion of the currency as disastrous to all the peo­
ple except the capitalist .out of debt and those
who stand in a position similar to his, he is
stating a truth which must be apparent to every
person who will give the matter careful considera­
tion. Mr. Sherman wag-at that time speaking
of the contraction of the. vdlnme of paper cur­
rency, but the principle, which he set forth ap­
plies if there is a contraction' of the volume of
the standard money of the world.
Mr. Blaine discussed the samra principle in con­
nection with the demonetization of silver. Speak­
ing in the house of reprksentatives on the 7th of
February, 1878. he said: ""I liplieve the struggle
now going on in this country and other countries
for a single gold standard wopld, if successful,
produce widespread disaster tlroughout the com­
mercial world. The destsuctionof silver as money
and the establishing of gold as the sole unit of
value must have a ruinous effect on all forms of
property except those investments which yield
a fled return in money. These would be enor­
mously enhanced iln value andywould gain a dis­
proportionate and pnfair advantage over every
other species of property, ._
Is it strange that the.. 'holders of investments
which yield a fixed return in inoney"" can regard
the destruction of silver'with"" omplacency? May
we not expect the holders :tf other forms of
property to protest agdlist giving to money a
""dsproportionate and tnnfa.rt advantage over
every other species of property.
If the relatively few whose wealth consists
largely in fixed investments have a right to use
the ballot to enhance the value of their invest­
ments, have not thli rest of the people the
right to use the ballot to­ protect themselves
from the disastrous consequcnces of a rising
standard? The people who must purchase
money with the products of toil stand in a
position entifely different from the position of
those who earn money or receive a fixed in­
come. The well-being of the nation-aye, of
civilization itself-depends upon the prosperity
of the masses.
Inv estmlents and Loans.
What shall it profit us to have a dollar whici
grows more valuable every day if such dollar
lowers the stanidard of civilization and brings
distress to the people? What shall it profit us
if, in trying to raise our credit by increasing
the purchasing power of our dollar, we destroy
our ability to pay the debts ai-eady contracted
by lowering the purchasing pow;er of the prod­
ducts with which. those debts must be paid. It
it is asserted, as it constantly is asserted, that
the gold standard will enab:t us to borrow
more money from abroad. I reply mtat the res­
toration of bimetallism will restore the parity
between money and property, and thus permit
an era of prosperity which will enable the
American people to become­ loaners of money
instead of perpetual borrowers. Even if we de­
sire to borrow, how long can we continue bor­
rowing under a system which, by lowering the

Power of Gold land Silver.
As ilginsIIRt the miaintenance of a gold standard,
either permanently or untlt other nations can
be united for its overthrow, the Chi'ago plat­
forml presents ia clelr land elnphatic demand for
the initrdllito restoratlon of the free and uin­
lititted coinage of silver and olld at the pros­
ent legal ratio of 1(t to 1, without e""alting for
the nill or conisetlt of anly other nation. IWe are
not asking thatt a new expIeriment he tried; we
aire inistinng iiupon it retnrn to n Ilnalncial policy
approved by the experience of history and sup­
ported by all the prominent statestion of our na­
tioi, front the days of the first president down
to 1813. When we ask that our mintts Ihe
openi to the free and unlimited coinage of sli­
ver Into the full legal tender money, we are
lilDply askitng that the samte mint privileges
lie Iecorided to silver that are nlow accordedl to
gold. VWhlen we ask that this coinage be at the
ratio of 1ll to 1. we slinmply ask that our gold
coins and the standard sliver dollar-which, be
it rnlemembered contailns the sante amount of pure
silver as the first silver dlollir coined at our
ilints-retain their present weight anti fineness.
The theoretical advantuge of the blnetallic
systetm Is best stated by a Eturopean writer on
political economy who suggests the following
Illustration: A river fed from two sources is
mllore uniform In volumlle than a river fed from
one source-the reaison being '""that when one
of the feeders is swollen the other may be low;
whereas, it river which has but one fetleor must
rise or fall with that feeder. So In the case of
blietaillism; the volnme of metallic money re­
ceives conltrllbulltons from the gold mines and
the silver ubl.tes, and therefore varies less; and
the dollar, resting upon two metals, is less
clhangeable in Its purchasing power than the
dollar which rests on one metal only.
If there are two kinds of money the option
must rest either with the debtor or with the
creditor. Assuming that their rights are equal,
we nlust look itt the interests of society in gen­
cral In order to determine to which side the
olption should ihe given. Under the blmhitallie
systeOln gold and silver are linked together by
lImw at a fixed ratio, and lany person or persons
owning any quantity of elth'er metal can have
the siatite converted into full legal tender money.
It'f the creditor has the righlt to choose the metal
in which plitynent shall be matlo, it Is reasonable
to suppose that he will require the debtor to
pay in the dearer metal if there is any perceptl­
lle dilfference between the bullion values of the
mletails. Tlils new demllland createdl for the dearer
inetatl will nlake that metall dearer still, while
the deeroelsedl demand for the chetiaper metal
will tnlkue that metal cheapnler still. If, on the
other hand, the debtor exerelscs the option, it
is reasonable to suIplpose tihat, he will iay in
the chelper imettl It olle metal is iperceptibly
chliapner than the other; bullt the demnlandl thlus
created for the cheaptlr . lntal will raiso its
plice, while tile lessetled dematnd for the dearer
mtetal will lower its price. In other words,
when the creditor hats the .option, the metasI
are drllawn apart; whereas, when the debtor.has
the option, the metals are held togother ap­
proxltuitely at the ratio fixed by law; pro­
vlded tihe demand created is suilicient to absorb
all of lioth muetals prcsentted at the tmint. So­
cliety is, therefore, interested in having the op­
tlotl 'exeri-setld iby the debtor. Indleel, there can
he io such 1thing n real bmiitalllsint unless .the'
olptlon is exrclsold Iby the debtor. The oxercis
of the o'ptiont by: the debtor compelal the creditor
classes, whether domestle or foreign, to exert
themlselves to mnlnintain the parity between gold
and sliver at the legal ratio; whereas they
might find a protlt In driving one of the metals
to a preitlluim if they could then demand the
deirer mletal.

clNpolnslibilty for the Gold Dr~in.
It is constantly assumned bIy some that Ilthe

1810, iro responsllleo for the recent drain upon
the golt reserve, but this aissnmpttiotn is ollentirely
without foulndation. Secretary OCarlislo apipeared
before the lhoutse Connilttee on Approlpriatlons on
Janll. 21, 18015, and I qlloto from the printed re­
port of 1118 testlilony beforo the committee: ""Mr.
Sibley--i would like to ask you (perhaps noe on­
tirely connetcteil with the mttter utnder dissct­
sion) what olijectlon there could ibe to havlng
the optioln of redtleenting elther In silver or goldt

but If the pollcy of reserving to the government
at the beginning of resumrptioh the option of
redoming in gold or silver all its paper pre­
sented, I believe it would have worked bene­
lcally, and there would halto boon no trouble
growing out of It, but the secretaries of the
treasury from tihe beglnning of resumption have
pursued a policy of redeeming In gold or silver,
at the option of the holder of the paper, and if
any scecretary had afterwards attempted to change
that pollcy and force silver upon ai man who
wanted gold, or gold Ioln I mllanl who wanted
silver, and especially if he had made that at­
tellpt at such a critical period as we have lad
in the lust two years, my judgment Is it would
luave been very llisastrous.""
I do not agree with the secretary. that it was
'Ise to follow a lid precedent, but from his'
answer It will be seen that the fault does not
lie with the greenbacks and treasury notes, but
rather with the executive offilers who have seen
lit to surrender a right which should have been'
xoercised for the protection of the interests
of the people. This executive action has already
been mlade the excuse for fhi Issue of more than
$2""O0,C1,000 bonds, and it is impossible to
estnhuato the anmonnt of bonds which mIiy here­
after le 1ssued if tills pollcy is continued.
VWe are told that any attempt upon the part
of the government to redeem Its obligations nl
sliver would put a premium upon gold; but
why should it? The lhink of lirance exorcises
the right to roedeemn all Ianks' paper either in
gold or silver, and yet France maintains the
lprity between gold. 1llid silver at the ratio of
1t~j to 1 and retains ln circEulation more silver
per capita thln we do in the United States.
It mar h1, further answered that our opponents
have suggested no feasile plan fuor avoiding -the
dangers which they fear. The retirement of the
greenllacks alnd treasury notes would not protect
the treasury, iecunse the eSI policy which
now leads the secretary of the trealsry to re­
deem. all governmlent paper In gold, when gold
Is demalnded. vwill requlr the redemption of

the g6oernnment should retire Its paper and
throw iullpl the blnks the necessity of furnish­
Ing coin redemption, the blnks would exercise
the right to furnish either gold or silver. In
other words, they would exercise the option,
just as the government ought to exercise At now.
Thl government must either exercise the right
to reldeini Its obligations in silver when silver

silver nnll silver certifieates from circulation
and leave nothitig but gold as legal tender
money. Are our opponents willing to outline a
luanllhial systlle which will carry out thelr
pollcy to its legitinalit conclusion or will they

phrases?
1""ree Coinlage an1d Vrultucs.
'there is all nctal necessity for bInmotallisnl
as well as a theoretical defense of It. During
the last twieinty-tlireeyears legislation bas been
errtlllng an additional demand for gold, and this
law-creaied demandl 1lhre resulted in1 Increasing
the lipurchasing power of each oullnce of gold.
TIhe restoration of bltuotalllstn in the United
States will take away from goldl ust so much
of Its purchasing power as was added to It by
the deloneztlzatlon of silver by the United
States. The sliver dollar Is now held up to
the gold dollar by ldgal tender laws and not by
redemptloll in gold, becase the standard silver
dollars are not now retldeemable In gold, either
In 1:law or by adminiistrative policy.
Wi colltelnd that free nd .ullllmited coinage by
tile United States alone will rnise the bullion
value of silver to its"" coinage value, and thus
nmake silver bullion worth $1.211 per ounce In
gold throughout the world. This proposition is
In keiting with atlurll laws, not in dellance of
them. Thle best lllknown law of conlllerce is the
law of supply and demand. We recognize this
law and build our argument upon It. We apply
this law to money when w1o su' that a redullc­
tlin Ia the volume of luoney will false the puir­
chsinlg power of the dollar; we 1110 apply the
luaw of slpplly and demand to ilver whemn we
say that ia new demand for sliver created by
law Ivill raise the priceo of silver bullion: Gold
anld sliver aro different from other comlumodlties,
in thiat they naro .limnited'. n quantity. Corn,
wheat, llnufall culllred products, etc., cat be pro­
dulced almost without limit provilded they­ can
be sold alt a price sullicienlt to stilulate produc­
tion; but goll and sliver are called precious
jetuiL because they are found, not produced.
L-' _These metals have been the objects of anxious
search as far back as history runs, yet, accord­
ing to Mr. Harvey's calculation, all the gold
coin of the world can be melted into a 22-foot
cube and all the silver coin in the world into
a 60-foot cube. Because gold and slilver are
limited, both In tile quantity now In hand and
in actual production, It follows that legislation
can fix the ratio between them. Any purchaser
who stands ready to take the entire supply of
any given article at a certain price, will pre­
vent that article from falling below that price.
So the government can lix a price for gold and
silver by creating a demand greater than the
supply. International bilretallasts believe that
several nations, by entering into an agreement
to coin at a fixed ratio all the gold and silver
presented, can maintain the hullion value of the
metals at the mint ratio. W'hen a mint price is
tihus establlshei it regulates the bullion price,
because any person desiring coin may have the
bullion converted Into coin at that price, and
any person desiring bullion can secure it by
melting the coin.
A Point of Difference.
The only question upon which international
bimetallists and independent bilmetallists differ
is: Can the United States, by the free and
unlimited coinage of silver at the present legal
ratio, create a demand for silver which, taken
In connection with the demand already in ex­
istence. will be sufillcint to utilize all the
silver that will be presented at the mints?
They agree In their defense of the blmetallic
principle, and they agree in unalterable oppo­
sition to the gold standard. International bi­
metallists cannot complain that free colnage)
gives a hIeneit to the aline 6wner, iecauser In­
ternational bmretllrsmn gives to the owner of
silver all the advantages offered by independent
uimetallismn at tile same ratio. International bi­
metallists cannot accuse the advocates of free
silver of being ""bullion owners who desire to
raise the value of their bullion."" or ""debtors
who desire to pay their debts in cheap dollars,""
or. ""denagogues vwho destire to curry favor with
the people."" They must rest their opposition
upon one ground only, illnely: That the sup­
ply of silver available for coinage is too large
to be utilized by' the United States.
In discussing this question we must consider
the capacity of our people to use silver and
the quantity of silver which can come to our
Inints. It must be remembered that we live
in a country only partially developed, and that
our people far surpass any equal numllber of peo­
ple in the world in their power to consume
and produce. Our extensive railroad develop­
ment and enormous Internal commerce must also
be taken into consideration. Now, how much
silver can come here? Not the coined silver of
the world, because almost all of it is more
valuable at this time in other lands than it
will be at our mints under free coinage. If our
mints are opened to free and unlimited coinage
at the present ratio, merchandise silver cannot
come here because the labor applied to it has
made it worth more in the form of merchandise
than it will be worth at our mints. We cannot
even expect all of the annual product of silver,
because India, China, Japan, Mexico and all
tihe other silver using countries must satisfy
tlleir anllnual needs from the annulal product;
the arts will require a large amount, and the
gold standard countries will need a considerable
quantity for suibsdiary coinage. We will he
.required to coit only that which is not needed
elsewhere; but, if we stand ready to take and
utilize all of it, other nations will be com­
pelled to buy at tile price which we fix.
Many fear that the opening of our mints will
be followed by the enormous increase in the an­
nual production of silver. Tlls is conjecture.
Silver has been used as money for thousands of
years, and during all of that time the world has
never suffered from an overproduction. If, for
any reason, the supply of gold or silver in the
future ever exceeds tile requirements of the arts
and the 'needs of commerce, we confidently hope
that the intelligence of the people will be suf­
ileient to devise and enact any legislation neces­
sary for tilhe protection of the iublic. It is folly
to refuse to the people the money which they
now need for fear they may hereafter have more
than they need. I am firmly convinced that by
opening our mints to free and unlimited coinage
at the present ratio we can create a demand for
silver which will keep the price of silver bullion
at $1.29 per ounce, measured by gold.
Fall in the Value of Silver.
Some of our opponents attribute the fall in the
value of silver, when measured by gold, to the
fact that during the last quarter of a century
the world's supply of silver has increased more
rapidly than the world's supply of gold. This
argument is entirely answered by. the fact that
during the last five years tile annual production
of gold has increased more rapidly than the an­
nual production of silver. Since the gold price
of silver has fallen more during the last five
years than it ever fell in any previous five years
in­ the history of the world, it is evident that
tile fall is not due to increased production.
Prices can be lowered as cffectually by decreas­
ing tile demand for an article is by increasing
the supply of it, and it seems certain that. the
fall in the gold price of silver is due to hostile
legislation, and not to natural laws.
Our opponents cannot ignore the fact that gold
is now going abroad in spite of all legislation In­
tended to prevent it, and no silver is being coined
to take its place. Not only is gold going abroad
now, but it must continue to go abroad so long
as the present flnancla! policy is adhered to,
unless we continue -to borrow from across the
ocean, and even then. we simply postpone the
evil, because the amount borrowed together
with interest upon it, must be repaid in appreci­
ating. dollars. Thle American people now owe a
large srum to :liuropean creditors, and falling
prices have left a larger and larger 'margiln be­
tween our' net national income and our nationtal
iiterest charge. There is only one way to stop
the increasing flow of gold from our shores, and
that is to stop falling prices. The restoration of
bimetallism will not only stop falling prices, but
will, to some extent, restore prices by reducing
the world's demand for gold. If it is argued that
a rise in prices lessens the value of the dollars
which we pay to our crelditors, I reply that, in
the balancing of equalities, the American people
lutve as much right to favor a filuncial system
which will maintain or restore prices as foreign
ereditors have to insist upon a financial system
that will reduce prices. Bitt the interests of
society are far superior to the Interests of either
debtors or creditors, and the interests of society
demand a financial system which will add to the
volume of the standard money of the world, and
tlhus restore stability to prices:
I'erhaps tie most persistent misrepresentation
that we have to meet is the charge that we are
advocating the payments of debts in 50-cent
dollars. Ab the present time and under presqnt
laws a silver dollar,, hen melted, loses nearly
half its value, but that will not be true when
we again establish a mint price for silver arind
leave no surplus silver upon tie market to drag
down the price of bullion. Under bimetallism
silver bullion will be worth as much as silver
coin, just as gold bullion is now worth as much
as gold coin, but we bhlleve that a silver dollar
will he worth as much as a gold dollar. The
charge of repudiation comes with poor grace
from those who are seekling to add to the weight
of existing debts by legislation which makes
money dearer, and who conceal theilr designs
against the general welfare under the euphonious
pretense that they are upholding public credit
and national honor.
In answer to the charge that gold will go
abroad,. it must be remembered that no gold
cant leave this country until the owner of the
gold receives something in return for it which
he would rather have. In other words, when
gold leaves the country, those who formerly
owned it will be benefited. There is no process
by which we can be compelled to part with our
gold against our will, nor is there any process
by which silver can be forced upon us without
our . conset. Excllanges are matters of agree­
ment, and. if silver comes to this country under
free coinage, it will be at tile invitation of some
one in this country who will give something in
exchange for it.
Parity Between the Metals.
Those who deny the ability of the United
States to maintain­ the parity between gold and
silver at the present legal ratio without foreign
aid, point to Mexico and assert that the opening
of our mints will reduce us to a silver basis and
raise gold to a premium. It is no reflection upon
our sister republic to remind our people that the
United States is much greater than Mexico in
area, in population and in commercial strength.
It is absurd to assert that the United States is
not able to do anything which Mexico has failed
to accomplish. The one thing necessary in order
to maintain the parity is to furnish a demand
.great enough to utilize all the silver which will
come to the mints. That Mexico has failed to do
this is no proof that the United States would
also fall. It is also argued that, since a num­
ber of the nations have demonetized silver. noth­
ing can be done until all these nations restore
blmetallism. This is also illogical. It is imma­
terial how many or how few nations have open
mints, iprovidled there are sutllcicen open mints to
furnish a monetary demand for all the gold and
silver available for coinage.
In reply to the -argument that improved ma­
chinery has lessened the cost of producing silver,
it is sufficient to say that the samno is true of the
prodllction of gold, and yet, notwithstanding
that, gold has risen in value. As a matter of
fact tile cost of production does not d(etermino
the value of the preclous metals, except as it
may affect tile supply. If, for instance, the
cost of producing, gold should be reduced 90 per
cent. without any 'increase in the output, the
purchasing power of an ounce of gold would not
fall. So long as there. is a monetary demand suf­
ticient, to take at a fixed mlint price all the gold
and silver produced, the cost of produlction need
not he considered.
It is often objected that the prices of gold and
silver cannot be fixed in relation to each other
because of .ho variation in the Ielative lproIhtc­
tion of til' metals. This arlgument also overlooks
the fact that if the demand for both metals at
a tixgd price is greater than the supply of both,
relative production becomes immaterill. In the
early part of the present century the annual pro­
dluction of silver was worth at the coinage ratio
about three times as much as the annlal pro­
duction of gold: whereas. soon after 1849, the
anllal production of goll iecame worth about
three times as much at tile coinage ratio as the
annullal production of silver; and yet, owing to
the maintenance of tile bIniotallic standard,
these enormous changes in relative production had
but a slight effect upon the relative values of
the metals.
MIine Owners and Free Silver.
If it is asserted by ounr opponents that the free
coinage of silver is intended only for the bene­
fit of the mine owners. It must be renmembered
that free coinage cannot restore to the mine
owners, any more than demonetization took away,
and it must also be remembered that the loss
.whlih the demonetization of the silver has
brought to the llino e wners is insigniflcant com­
pareo to the loss which this policy has brought
to the rest of the people. 'he restoration of
silver will bring to the people generally many
times as much advantage as the mine owners
can obtain from It. While it is not the pur­
pose of free coinage to especially aid any par­
ticular class, yet those who believe that tile
restoration of silver is needed by the whole
people should not be deterred because an in­
eldental lheneilt will come to the mine owner.
The erection of forts, the deepening of harbors,
the improvelent of rivers, the eretilon of pibl)­
lie buildings-all these confer incidental benefits
upolt individuals and communities, and yet these
incidental benefits do not deter us from making
appropriations for these purposes whenever sullc
aplropriations are necessary for the public good.
The argument that a siliver dollar is heavlier
than a gold dollar, and therefore that silver is
less convenient to carry in large quantities, is
completely answered by the siver certiicante,
whlich is as easily carried as the gold certiicate
or say other kind of paper molley.
Tiere are some, who, while admitting the
benefits of bimetallism, object to coinage at
the present ratio. If any are deceived by this
objection, they ought to remember that there
are no bimetallists who are earnestly endeavor­
ing to secure it at any other ratio titan 16 to.1.
We are opposed Q any change in the ratio for two reasons: First, because a change would
produce great Injustice: and second, because a
change in the ratio is not necessary. A change
would produce injustice because. if effected In
the manner usually suggested. it would result
in an enormous contraction in the volume of
standard money. If, for instance, it was de­
cided by international agreement to raise the
ratios throughout the world to 32 to 1, the
change might be effected in any one of three
ways: The silver 'dollar could he doubled in
size, so that the new silver dollar would weigh
thirty-two times as much as the present gold
dollar; or the present gold dollar could be re­
duced one-half In weight, so that the present
silver dollar would neiglf thirty-two times as
much as the new gold dollar; or the change
could be made by increasing the size of the
silver dollar and decreasing the size of the
gold dollar until the new silver dollar would
weigh thirty-two times as much as the new
gold dollar. Those who have advised a change
In the ratio have usually suggested that the
silver dollar be doubled. If this change were
made it would necessitate the recoinage of
four billions of silver into two billions of dol­
lars. There would be an immediate loss of
$2,000,000.000 either to individuals or to the
government. But this would be the least of the
injury. A shrinkage of one-half In the silver
money of the­ world would mean a shrinkane
of one-fourth in the total volume of metallic
money. This contraction, by increasing the
value of the dollar, would virtually . increase
the debts o-2 the world billions of dollars, and
decrease still more tile value of the property of
the world as measured by dollars. Besides this
,immediate result, such a change in the ratio
w'oull permanently decrease the annual addition
to tile world's supply of money because the an­
nual silver product., when coined Into dollars
twice as large, would make' only half as many
dollars.
The people of the United­ States would be in­
jured by a change in the ratio not because they
prodlnce silver but because they own property
and owe debts a:nd they cannot afford to thus
decrease the 11ilue of their property or increase
the burden otf their debts.
In 1878 Mr. Carlisle said: ""Mankind will be
fortunate Indeed if the annual production of
gold and silver coin shall keep lace with an­
nuall increase of population and industry."" I
repeat this assertion. All of the gold and sil­
ver allnually available for coinage, when con­
vertedl into coin at tile present ratio, will not.
in my judgment,, more than supply our monetary
needs.
iVants More Money.
In supporting the act of 1890, known as the
Sherman..act, Senator Sherman on Jnne 5 of
that year said: ""Under. the law of February,
1878, the purchases of $2,000,000 worth of slil­
ver bullion a month has by coinage produced
afinually an average of nearly $3,000,000.000 per
month for a period of twelve years: but this
amount, in view of the retirement of the bank
notes, will not increase our currency in propor­
tion to our increasing population. If our present
currency is estilmated at $1,400,000.000 and our
population is increasing at the ratio of 3"" per
cent. per annum, it would require $42,000,000
increased circulation each year to. keep lace with
the Increase of the population; but, as the in­
crease of population is accompanied by a -till
greater ratio of Increase of wealth and business.
It was thought that an immediate increase of
circulation might be obtained by large purchases
of silver bullion to an anmount sufficient to make
good the retirement of bank notes and keep pace
with -the growth of population. Assuming that
$54,000,000 a year of additional currency is
needed upon this basis, that amount is provided
for in this bill by the issue of treasury notes in
exchange for bullion at the market price. If the
United States then needed more than $42,000,000
annually to keep. pace with population and busi­
ness, it now, with a larger population, needs a
still greater annual addition: and the United
States is only one nation among many. Our
opponents make no adequate provision for the
increasing monetary needs of the world.
No Change in Ratio. -
In the Second place, a change In the ratio Is
not necessary. Hostile legislation has de­
creased the demand for silver and lowered its
price when-.measured by gold, while this same
hostile legislation, by
. increasing the demand
for gold has raised the value of gold when
measured by other forms of property.
We are told that the restoration of bimetallism
would be a hardship -upon those who have en­
tered into contracts payable in gold coin, but
this is a mistake. It will be easier to obtain
the gold with which to meet a gold contract,
when most. of. the people.. can use silver, than
it is now when every one is -trying to secure
gold.
The Chicago platform, expressly declares in fa­
vor of such. legislation as may be necessary to pre­
vent for the future' the demonetization of any
-kind of legal tender money by private contract.
Such contracts are objected' to on the ground
that they are against pudile policy. No one
questions the right of legislatures to fix the
rate of interest which can be collected by law;
there is far more reason for preventing pirivate
individuals from setting aside a legal tender
law. The money, which is by law made a legal
tender must, in the course of ordinary business,
be accepted by ninety-nine out of every 100'
personts. Why should the one hundredth man be
pei'nitred to exempt himself from the general­
rule? Special contracts have a tendency to
increase the demand for a particular kind of
mouney and thus force it to a premihum. have
not the people a right to, say that a comlnra­
tively few""Individuals shidl nut Ire permitted
to derange the financial system of the nation In
order. to collect a.-premiumn il case they tsuc­
ceed in forcing one kind of money to a premium?.,
- 'Vill Call Special Session.
There is another argument 'to which I ask
your attention. Some of the more-zealous op­
ponents -of free coinage point to the fact that
thirteen months must elapse between the elec­
tion and the first regular session of congress,
and assert that during that time, in case peo­
ple declare themselves. in favor of free, coinage,
all loans will be withdrawn and all mortgages
foreclosed. If. these are merely prophesies in­
dulged in by those who' have forgotten the pro­
visions of the constitution. It will be sufficient
to remind them that the president is empowered
to. convene congress in extraordinary session
whenever the public good­ requires such action.
If in November the people by their ballots de­
clare­ themselves -in favor' of the immediate
restoration of bimetallism, the system can be
inaugurated within a few months. If. how­
ever, the.assertion that loans will be withdrawn
and mortgages foreclosed is made to prevent
such political action as the people may believe
to be necessary for the preservation of their
rights, then a new and vital issue is raised.
Whenever it is necessary for the people as a
whole to obtain consent from the owners of
money and the changers of money before they
can legislate upon financial questions we shall
have passed from a democracy to a plutocracy.
But that time has not arrived. Threats and
intimidation will be of no avail. The people
who in 1776 rejected the doctrine that kings
rule by right divine, will not in this generation
subscribe to a doctrine that money is omnipotent.
In conclusion permit me -to say a word in re­
gard to international bimetallism. We are not
opposed to an international agreement, looking
to the restoration of bimetallism throughout the
world. The advocates of free coinage have on all
occasions shown . their willingness to coiiperate
with othler nations in the reinstatement of silver,
but they are not willing to await the pleasure
of other governments when immediate relief is
needed by the people of the United States; and
they further believe 'that - independent action
offers better assurance of international bimetal­
lIsm than servile dependence .upon foreign aid.
For more than twenty years we have invited the
assistance of European nations, but all progress
in the direction of international blmetallism has
been blocked by the opposition of those who de­
rive a pecuniary benefit from the appreciation of
gold. How long must we wait for bimetallism to
be brought to us by those who profit by mono­
metallism? If the double standard will bring
benefits to our people who will deny them the
right to enjoy those benefits?
If our opponents would admit the right, the
ability and the duty of our people to act for
themselves on all publie questions without the
assistance and regardless of the wishes of other
nations, and then propose the remedial legis­
latTon which they consider sufficient, we could
meet them in the field of honorable debate; but
when they assert that this nation is helpless to
protect the rights of its own citizens, we chal­
lenge them to submit theirs to a people. whose
patriotism has never been appealed to in vain.
Calls It American Dignity.
We shall not offend other nations when we
declare the right of the American people to
govern themselves, and without let or hinder­
ance from without, decide upon every question
presented for their consideration. In taking
this position, we simply maintain the dignity
of seventy million persons who are second to
none in their capacity for self government. The
gold standard has compelled the American peo­
ple to pay an ever increasing tribute to the
creditor nations of the world-a tribute which
no one dares to defend. I assert that national
honor requires the United States to secure jus­
tice for all its citizens as well as do justice to
all its creditors. For a people like ours, blest
With natural resources of surpassing richness, to
proclaim themselves impotent to frame a finan­
cial system suited to their own needs, is humil­
lating beyond the power of langiuage to de­
scribe. We cannot enforce respect for our for­
eign policy so long as we confess ourselves un­
able to frame our own financial policy.
Honest diffeiences of oplinion n-have always ex­
isted and over will exist as to the legislation
best calculated to promote the public weal; but
when it is seriously asserted that this nation
must bow to the dictation of other nations and
accept the polices which they insist upon, the
right of self gove nment is assailed, and until
that question Is settled all other questions are
insignificant.
An Appeal to the East.
Citizens of New York, I have traveled from
the center of the continent to the seaboard that
I might in the very beginning of the .ampaign
bring you greeting from the people out West and
South and assure you that their desire is not to
destroy, but to build up. They invite you to ac­
cept the principles of a living faith rather than
listen to those who preach the gospel of despair
and advise endurance of the ills you have. The
advocates' of free coinage believe that, in striv­
ing to secure the immediate restoration of bi­
metallism, they are laboring in your behalf as
well as in their own behalf. A few of your
people may prosper under present conditions, but
the permanent welfare of New York rests upon
the producers of wealth. The great city is built
on the commerce of the nation and must suffer
if that commerce is impaired. You cannot sell
unless the people have money with which to
buy, and they cannot obta'n the money with
which to buy unless they are able to sell their
products at remunerative prices. Production of
wealth goes before the exchange of wealth;
those' who create must secure r profit before
they have anything to share with others. You
cannot afford to join the money changers in sup­
port of a financial policy by which they destroy
the purchasing power of the products of tiie
toil and which must in the end discourage the
creation of wealth.
I ask, I expect, your coiiperation. It is true
that a few of your financiers would fashion a
new ftigure-a figure representing Columbia, her
hands bound fast with fetters of gold and her
face turned towards the East, appealing for as­
sistance to those who live beyond the sea; but
this figure can never express your idea of thif
nation. You will rather turn for inspiration to
the heroic statue which guards the entrance
to your city-a statue as patriotic in conception
as it is colossal in proportions: it was the
gracioud gift of a sister republic and stands
upon a pedestal which was built by the Amer­
iclan peoplo. That figure-Liberty Enlightening
thle World-is emblematic of the mission of our
nation among tile nations of the earth. With
a government .hich derives it ,gowers from the consent of th'"" gSderned. secures to all the
people freedom 6f 6Onselence, freedom of thought
and freedom d'0 sp'it'Lb, guarantees eqlual rights

dent instead, of ; fol.owing the wise prece
denU of former times, and esckially that
tn the case of Judge reck, aad referrmg the
accusation to the Committee on Judiciary.
Tho House has made Sy accuser one of

justice, and 1 eondemned ; by the practice
of all.: civilized nations. tu very freeman
must revolt at euch a siwctnole. : lam to
appear before Mr, Covode either personal
ly or by a substitute to cross examine the
witness which he may produce before him
self to sustain his own accusations against
me, and perhaps even this poor boon may
be denied to the President. .And what is
the nature of the investigation which, his
resolution purposes to insinuate ; It is
vague and general as the ' English Ian
gunge affords with which to make it ""The
Committee is to inquire not into any ' spe­
cific charges but whether the President
has by money patronage' or other . prope:
means, sought te influence, not,' the action'
of any individual member or membere of
Congress, but the action 6f the entire body
of Congres itself, or any Committee there
of- . . ; v. -. ;. : .
, The President may Lave had some ""lim
mering of the nature of the offence to be
investigated, had his accusers pointed out
the net or acts of Congress which he sought
to pass or defeat by the employment of
money, patronage or other improper means,
but the accusation is bounded by no such
limits. It extends lo the ' whole circle of
legislation lo interference for or against
the passage of any law appertaining to the
rights of any Stnte or Territory ; arid what
law' does not appertain' to the rights of
some btate or Territory ! and what law or
laws has the President failed to execute
These might easily have beeu' pointed out
bad any such existed. Had Mr, Lawless
asked an inquiry lo be made by the House
whether Judge Peck in general terms had
not violated his judicial duty, without spe
cifying any particular act, I do not believe
there would have been a single vote in
that body in favor of the enquiry.' Since
the lime of Uie Star Chamber and of gen
eral warrants, there has been no such pro
ceedings in England. The House of Ret
resenlatives, the high impeaching power of
tne country, without consenting to hear a
word of explanation, have endorsed this ac
cusation against the President, and made
it their own act. . - '. ,
They even refuse to permit a member to
enquire of Ibe Presidents accuser what
were ihe speihe charges against him. Thus
in ""this preliminary accusation of hi
crimes end misdemeanors against a co-or
dinate branch of the Government under
the impeaching power, if the House refuse
to hear a single suggestion even in regard
to. the correct, mode of proceeding, but
without a moment's delay pass accusatory
resolutions under the pressure of the pre
vious . question. In the institution of 1
prosecution for any offence against the
most humble citizen, I claim for myself no
greater rights than he enjoys. The Con
stitutions of the U. S. and of the several
States require that he shall be informed at
the very beginning of the nature and cause
of the accusation against, htm, in order, to
enable him to prepare for his defense. ""'
' . There are other principles which I might
enumerate, not less sacred, presenting an
impenetrable shield to protect every citizen
lalsely charged with a criminal onx-ucc,
loese have been violated, in tba prosecu
tion instituted by the House of Represent
atives against the Executive branch of the
Government, , ""..'"".."".''. T'.t
Shall the Prcsidont alono be deprived of
Ihe protection of these great principles
which prevail in every land , where a ray of
liberty penetrates the gloom of despotism.
Shall the . Executive, be deprived of the
rights which all his fellow citizens enjoy !
ihe whole proceedings against him justify
the fears of those great and wise men. who
before the constitution was adopted by the
Slates, apprehended that the tendency of
the Government was towards .the aggran
disement of, the Legislative- at the expense
of the executive and Judicial departments.
I again declare emphatically that I. make
this protest for no reasons personal to my
self, and l do with perfect respect. for .the
House of Representatives which I hadthd
honor or serving for five successive terms.
I have' lived Jong in this goodly land and

President was guilty of a violation of hia

The convention reassembled at to
o'clock and effected a permanent organi
zation by selecting W. H. Bell, of Mus­
kingum, as chairman, when the con­
vention, with cheers, adopted the fol
lowing
PLATFORM.
Jiexolved. That the Democratic
party seeks to revive no dead issues, but
stands by its principles, which are suited
to all circumstances. It supports the
federal government in all its constitu
tional authority, and opposer nullifica
tion anil secession, it detenus tne re
served rights of the States and people
and opposes the centralization that
would impair and destroy them. In or
der to maintain and preserve these
rights, it insists upon a strict construc­
tion of the federal constitution. It re
sists all attempts of one department of
the government to usurp or aestroy tne
constitutional rights or independence of
other departments, it opposes all inter
ference oy law witu tne private aiiairs
or business of men not required by the
public peace or safety, and advocates
tne greatest muiviuuai uueriy consist
ent with public order, and believes in
the capacity of tne peepie ror
self-government, and opposes all
property qualification as the conditions
to the nent oi sunraee. or eiiRiDinty to
hold office. It favors liberal laws for
naturalization of foreigners; it insists
upon equal and exact justice to all men;
it opposes all monopolies, and denies
(hat it is within the province of the
government to legislate for the benefit
of particular classes at the expense and
to :ne detriment oi tne rest oi tne com-
imunlty. Ittherefore, opposes the sys
tem by wnicn a large portion
df the profit-producing wealth of
the country Is exempted from
taxatiou, and demands that
all constitutional means shall be used to
remedy this injustice. It insists that
our tariff laws should be framed with a
view to revenue, and not to tax the com­
munity for the benefit of particular in­
dustries. 3t recognizes the evils of a
irredeemable currency, but insists that on
a return to specie payments care shall
be taken not to seriously disturb the bus­
iness of the country or unjustly injure
the debtor class. It appreciates the ben­
efits conferred by railroads, but op­
pose all combinations of railroad
companies for the purpose of preventing
competition, anu inus enuance tne cost
of transportation. It opposes all laws
mat give to capital any advantage over
labor. It requires honesty and econo­
my in every department of the govern­
ment, federal or State, and it condemns
corruption, whoever may be the guilty
parties. It is, In its very nature, and as
a necessary result of Its principles, a-
party oi progress, anu supports all meas­
ures, of reform or improvement that are
sanctioned by justice and commended
by sound sense and practical wisdom.
Jiesolved, That the wealth of a coun­
try is the- product of Its labor, and the
best use of capital is that which gives
employment and liberal wages to the
producing classes. Hence, every Just
measure that tends to protect them from
oppression, and Improve their condition, i
and dignify their calling, deserves and
receives our sympathy and-support, and
that we cordially recommend the con­
servative resolutions adopted at the re­
cent national labor congress at Cleve­
land, favoring arbitration andco-operation.
stituting a large majority of the Ameri
can people, agriculturists have never de­
manded of the government, State or
federal, any special privilege, and have
never Infested the nails of congress, or
of legislatures with lobbyists and rings,
but, on the contrary, have suffered un­
der discriminating and unjust laws until
forbearance has ceased to be a virtue.
We hereby pledge our sincere and hon­
est efforts to obtain for them a redress
of grievances, and equal and exact jus­
tice.Jieeoleed, That the public lands' should
be sacredly reserved for actual -settlers,
who will dwell upon and cultivate them,
and that we will continue to denounce
and oppose, as we have always de­
nounced and opposed all gifts of such
lands'-By the government to incorpo­
Tatedicompaniea.-jajl!S.That 1116 greatest danger to

when an army of offlce-liolders,with the

influence to control elections; when the
bribery of customhouse officers is an es­

by the united voices of the people.
Jiesolved, That we condemn, without

iug additional salaries as unjust aud un­
justifiable, and demand its immediate
and unconditional repeal, and we de­
nounce every member ""of congress,
whether Republican or Democrat, who
supported the law, or received and re
tained money procured thereby, and we
especially denounce the conduct of
President GranVin uaiug the influence
of his high position for its passage, and

Resolved, That the act of the Presi­
dent in setting up by bayonets a govern­
ment in .Louisiana .not chosen by her
people, and having no title whateverto
rule over them, was a flagrant violation
of her rights and of the federal constitu­
tion.Mesolvcd, That every department of
the government being in the hands of
the Republican party, they arejustly-responsible
for the evils and wrongs,In
the legislation and administration, of
which the country complains.

Democratic banner with this
declaration of principles inscribed upon

earnestly appeal to patriotic mem.Qf i

"237","42950357222","The duties composing the Mediterranean will cease, by law, at the end of the present session. Considering, however, that they are levied chiefly on luxuries, and that we have an impost of salt, necessary of life, the free use of which otherwise is so important, recommend to your consideration the suppression of the duties on suit, and the continuation of the Mediterranean fund, instead thereof, for short time, after which that also will become unnecessary for any purpose now within contemplation. When both of these branches of revenue shall, in this way, be relinquished, there will still, ere long, he an accumulation of monies ""in the treasury, beyond the instalments of publick debt which w.1 are permitted by to puy. They then, without modification, assented to by the publick creditors, be applied to the .it of this debt, and the -te liberation of our revenues, the most desirable of all objects. Nor, it* our peace continues, will they be wanting for any other existing purpose. The question, therefore, now comes forward, to what other objects sh:dl these be appropriated, and the whole surplus of impost, after the entire discharge of the publick debt, and during those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call for them Shall we suppress the impost, and give that advantage to foreign over manufactures On few articles, of more general and necessary use, the suppression, in due season, wilt doubtless be ri^ht but the great mass of the articles, on which impost is paid, are foreign luxuries, purchased by those only who are rich enough t(f afford es the use of them. Their patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to the great purposes of the publick education, roads, rivers, canals, and such other objects of publick improvement as it may be thought proper to add to tiie enumeration of
                 era! powers. By these operations, new channels of communication will b# opened between the States the lines of separation will disappear, their interests will be identified, and their union cemented by new and indissoluble ties. Education is here placed among- the articles of publick care, not that it would be proposed to take ill ordinary branches out of the hands of private enterprize, -which manages so much better all the concerns to which it is equal but publick institution can alone supply those sciences, which, though rarely called for, are yet necessary to complete the circle, all the parts of which contribute to the improvement of the country, and some of them to its preservation. The subject is now proposed for the consideration of congress, because, if approved, by the time the state legislatures* ahall have deliberated on this extension of the federal trusts and the lawa shall be passed, and other arrangements madd for their execution, the necessary funds will be on hand, and without employment. suppose an amendment of the constitution, by the consent of the States, necessary, because the objects now recommended are not among those enumerated in the and to which it permits the publick monies to be applied. The present consideration for national establishment for education particularly, is rendered proper by this circumstance also, that, if Congress, approving the proposition, shall yet think it more eligible to found it on donation of lands, they have it now in their power to endow it with those which will be among the earliest to produce the necessary income. This foundation would have the advantage of being independent on war, which may suspend other improvements by requiring for its own purposes the resources destined for them. This, fellow","news"

PHILIPPINE PROBLEIM.
Question will be Thoroughly Dis­
cussed by the Senate.
Washington, Dec. 18--What the Sen­
ate may accomplish in the way of leg­
islation for the Philippines during the
present session is problematic, but that
the question will be thoroughly dis­
cussed is indicated byh the number of
resolutions bearing upon it being pro­
duced.! In opposition of the retention
by the United States of the Philippine
islands two resolutions were introduced
today, one by Mr. Tillman of South
Carolina and the other by Mr. Bacon
of Georgia. Each resolution purposes
to yield the islands to a government to
be established by the Filipinos them­
selves.
Mr. Morgan of Alabama addressed
the Senate briefly upon the necessity of
legislation to control trusts, and had
his joint resbiution again referred to the
Judiciary committee.
Bishop John F. Hurst of the Metho­
dist Episcopal church pronounced the
invocation at the opening of the ses­

MEMORIAL FROM HAWAIIA.
President pro tem. Frye presented l
a memorial elaborately 'bound and en­
grossed of the citizens of Hawaii,
adopted at a meeting in Honolulu on
July 4th last.. The memorial recited
that much uncertainty existed owing to
the failure of Congress to provide a
form of government for the Hawaiian I
islands and asked that the Territorial I
laws $f the United States be extended
to Hawaii. The memorial wa's referred
tb the Committee on Pacific Islands
and Porto Rico.
Mr. Mason presented numerous peti­
tions expressing 'sympathy with the
South African republic in their war
with Great Britain.
TILLMAN BREAKS' LOOSE.
Mr. Tillman offered a resolution de­
claring that' under the Constitution the
Federal Government has. no power to
. rule over colonial depcndencies and
maintaining further ""that we re

it is our purpose to consent to the in­
dependence of the Filipinos as soon as
a stable government shall be estab­

(Signed) WILLIAM WINDOI, Secretary.
The following is the form of request for con­
tinuanceof bonds:
[Date.] To the Secretary of the Treasury:
Under the terms of circular No. (blank),issued
by the Secretary of the Treasury May 12, 1881,
the undersigned, owner of the below-described
United States 5-per-cent bonds, issued under
the acts of July 14, 1870, and January 20, 1871,
hereby request that (blank) payment be de­
ferred, and that (blank) be continued during
the pleasure of the Government, to bear
interest at the rate of 3% per centum
per annum from August 12, 1881, as
provided in said circular, and in consideration
of the premises (blank) hereby waive and re­
lease all right to or claim for any interest on
said bond in excess of 3l per cent per annum
on and after said date of August 12, 1881; and
in witness thereof have hereunto set my hand
and seil this-day-. (Here describe the
bonds, stating whether registered or coupon,
denomination, serial numbers and amounts.)
(Signature and post office address.)
(Seal.) The seal should be of wafer or wax
if not executed by a corporation.
In case the above request is signed by the
officer of a bank or other corporation it should
be accompanied by proper authority, certified
by some officer of the institution other than
the one empowered to act. If the bonds are
presented at the London agency, forms of re­
quest for their continuance must be executed
in duplicate. The form of request prepared in
blank for use will be furnished upon applica­
r
tion to the Secretary of the Treasury.
. The amountof coupon bonds above referred
to, which are now outstanding and covered by
the call, is about $120,000,000. The total amount
of registered 5-per-cent bonds is about $325,­
000,000. The privilege of extending registered
5 per cents at a reduced rate of interest being
limited to $250,000,000, there will remain atleast
t
$75,000,00 of them which the Secretary of the
Treasury intends to pay absolutely out of the
surplus revenue. It is believed at the depart­
ment that much more than $230,000,000 of these
registered bonds will be offered for continu­
ance, but all applications received after the
maximum of $250,000,000 shall have been pre­
sented will not be entertained.
MIINOR MIATTERS.
Up to the close of business to-day there had
been received and counted at tihe loan division
of the Treasury Department $143,081,950 6-per­
cent bonds for continuance at 3% per cent.
There are known to be about $17,000,000 more
of these bonds in the Treasurer's office not
acted upon, leaving but about $30,000,000 yet to
be heard from. No returns yet from the.Lon­
don agency.

MORTGAGED HOMES.

Census Figures on Incumbered
Farms.
Washington. July 29.—The count of
the Farm and Home transcripts, made
in accordence with the mortgage collec­
tion clause of the census act, lias been
completed by the census office. The
figures are subject to slight
modifications. There were returned by
the enumerators 2,491,030 farms and
homes occupied by owners which are
incumbered by mortgages. This num­
ber includes some farms and homes
about which the enumerators made no
report, ana which belong partly to the
class of hired and partly to the class of
owned free, as well as partly to the
class of owned and incumbered. Until
this unknown quantiy, due to the
failure of the enumerators,, is
eliminated, it may be regarded as ap
proximately true that 2,250,000 families
of the 12,500,000 families in tiie United
Stotes occupy and own incumbered
homes and farms, and that 10,250,000
families occupy farms and homes that
are either hired or owned free.
The proportion of hired and owned
free homes and farms will be known
when the population division completes
the count of the returns pertaining to
them. The preliminary results indicate
that the average debt for a farm in
lowa is $1,283; home, $719; average for
farm and home, $1,140. If these aver­
ages hold good for the union the incum­
brance on the farms and homes of the
United States occupied by own­
ers is about $2,5.5,000,000. The
success of this investigation, Supt.
Porter says, has been far be­
yond the anticipations of the most ex­
perienced statisticians, and the result
will be of immense interest and value
to the nation. The first volume relating
to recorded indebtedness will probably
co to press this year. In complete re­
turns from several Western states indi­
cate that farms and homes are mortgaged
for about one-third the value put upon
them by the owners.

CHICAGO, April 6.—A special dis­
patch to the Tribune from Washing­
ton says: The United States su­
preme court, in the income tax case,
has reversed the .decision 'of■-.. the
lower court, but the income tax law
as a whole is upheld,, but only by a
divided court. Two important points
of law, . however, have- been decided
to be unconstitutional,.and they are
so serious as to affect tnaterially, not
only the revenues of the govern­
ment, but the -estimation in which
the income tax will be : held by the
people. Under, the decision to be
handed down by ; the court, all in­
comes derived from rents are ex­
empted from taxation by the federal
government, and all-incomes de­
rived from state and municipal
bonds are similarly 'exempted. In
other respects the income tax law
stands as it was passed last August,
but the result of the consultations
in the supreme court shows very
conclusively that the law can *be
easily ' 'v';""---;t:
PICKED TO PIECES,
provided suits are brought to contest
each particular point that comes up.
It Is a curious fact, but none the less
true, that the law which was passed
at the dictation of the Populistic wing
of a Democratic congress' has ''been
distorted by the decision of the United
States supreme court clearly on con- ]
stitutional grounds, in such a-way that
it will absolutely protect, the -class of
capitalists most offensive to the Popu­
listic element. The landlords of the
country will pay no income tax. The
owners of bonds of almost any kind,
either federal, state, county or mu­
nicipal, will also be free, while the busi­
ness man, the manufacturer and the
salaried employe, will for the present,
at least, be compelled to contribute to
the treasury of the United States gov­
ernment 2 per cent of all income in
excess of $4,000 per annum. The first
meeting of the supreme court was held
March 16, two days after the conclusion
of the arguments, but no decision was
reached, and it was not until March
30 that they succeeded in agreeing
upon the outlines of a decision, cover­
ing the opinion of the lower court. The
court was evenly divided. Justice
Jackson, too ill to take part, Justice
Fuller, Justices Field, Gray and Brew­
er were oposed to the law. Justices
Harlan, Brown, Shiras . and White
voted to sustain the law. The expecta­
tion among members, of I the court is
that the decision' will be rendered *
Monday, in open"" court, but there is a
bare possibility that the court may?
again split :up into irreconcilable sec­
tions, and hold up the decision. If
the next congress does not repeal the
law with the sanction of the president,
there will be a sudden rise in the price
of all local public securities, as well as
of all real estate, for, as they wil be
exempted from taxation, they ought
to get the benefit of the 2 per cent
which other income producers are
obliged to account for.

WASHINGTON, April The atten­
tion of several members of the cabi­
net was called today to the dispatch
this morning from Chicago, giving the
substance of the Chicago Tribune's
publication concerning the supreme
court decision on the income tax case,
but they declined to express any opin­
ion thereon, on the .ground that it
would be manifestly, improper to dis­
cuss any opinion of the court, until at
least it had been officially promulgated.
From another, but .an_ entirely au­
thentic source, it' is learned that what­
ever the decision of the court may be,
the president will not call an extra
session of congress,"" and, even should
the decision declare the law wholly un­
constitutional, the president' would ad­
i here to his determination not to call
congress together any sooner. All
efforts to secure from members of the

Corps, the litter composed principally of
Bureau officers of the various departments.
Tbe I'latform.
In front of the portico, but about 160 feet
lower, being on a level with the front land
ing place ot tbe flight of marble steps, had
been constructed a platform capable of ac­
commodating, together with the steps, about
500 or UK) people. It had a semi-circular
front, which was covered with American
flags, and tastefully decorated with wreaths
of evergreens. The national flag was also
inter wined with twenty of the columns sup
porting tne rresiaent on tne portico, and
tbe general enect harmonized well with the
splendor, of the noble building. On reach
ing the platform the President elect took
the seat provided for him, directly in front
of the centre, Vice President Colfax, and
tno. bergeant-at-arms in cnarge of the cere
monies, sitting on his right, and the Chief
Justice or the Supreme Court on his left.
The Senate committee of arrangements
were near at hand, and next in the rear the
Associate Justices of tne Supreme Court
occupied seats on the left, and the mem­
bers and Secretary of the Senate on tho
right. The diplomatic corps were to have
occupied seats in the rear of he Supreme
Court, but many of them were not suffi
ciently alert to prevent themselves being
Crowded Into tbe Bnchgrroand
by members of tbo House of Representa­
tives and others who were, pressed forward
by the general crowd behind. Tho cold
ness of the weather bad the effect of mak­
ing the number of spectators on the capi­
tol grounds opposite, and the streets adjoin
ing, much smaller to-day than on most of
similar occasions heretofore, but many
thousands were assembled to witness the
ceremonies. Near Gen. Grant on the plat
form sat
Sirs. Grant,
accompanied by several of their children,
the President's brother Orville, Marshal
and Mrs. Sharp, and several other relatives
of the family. The appearance of tha Pres­
ident on tbe platform was greeted with
enthusiastic cheers and with bursts of music
from the bands. All the various civic and
military organizations which were drawn
up in line of battle filled tha wide space
in front and extending the entire length of
the capitol. Tbe noise of greeting wai
hushed as the President elect and tbe Chief
Justice rose simultaneously, and the latter
commenced to recite the formula of the
President's "" .
Oatb of Office,
which Grant took with his head uncovered
and resumed his seat for a few moments,
while the boom of cannon, the ringing of
bells and the shouts of the vast multitude
burst forth with deafening sounds. Partial
quiet having been restored tha President,
arose and proceeded to read his
Innngrnrnl Address,
Fellow-Citizens t Under providence I
have been called a second time to act as
the Executive over this great nation. It
has been my endeavor In the past to main­
tain all the laws, and so far as lay in my
power to act for the best interest of tbe
people. My best efforts will be given in
tbe same direction in the future, aided I
trust by my four years experience in the
office. When my first term of the
office of Chief Executive began, the
country had not recovered from the efldcts

of a great Internal revolution, andthreo
of the former States of the Union bad not
been restored to their federal relations.
It seemed to mo wise that no newquestion
should be raised so Ion? as that condition
of affairs existed. Therefore tbe past four
years, so far as I could control events, have
been consumed in the effort to restore har­
mony, public credit, commerce and al the
arts of peace and progress.
. It is my firm conviction that the civilized
world is tending towards lepublicanism, or
government by the people through their
cbogen representatives, and that our great
Republic is destined to be the guiding star
to all others. Under our Republic wo sup­
port an army less than that of any Europe­
an power of any standing, and a navy le;s
than tha1. of either of at least five of them
there could be no extension of terri­
tory on this continent which would call
for an increase ot this force, but rather
might such extension enable us to diminish
it.
Tbe theory of government changes with
the general progress. Now that tho tele­
graph is made available for communicating
thought, together with the rapid transit by
steam, all parts of the continent are made
contiguous for all purposes of government,
and communication between the extreme
limits of the country is mido easier than
it was throughout tho ojd thirteen States
at the beginning of our national existence.
Tho effects of the late civil strife have
been to free the slave and inako him a citi­
zen. Yet he is not possessed of the civil
rights which citizenship ahould carry with
it. This is wrong and should be corrected.
To this correction I stand committed so
far as executive influence can avail. Serial
equality is not?J a subject to be legislated
upon, nor shall I ask anything to be done
to advance the social status of the colored
man except to give him a fair chance to
develop what there is good in him. Gite
him access to the schools, and when he
travels let him feel assured that his con­
duct will regulate tho treatment and 'fare
he will receive.
The States lately at war with the Gen­
al Government are now happily rehabited
and no executive control is exercised in any
one of them that would not be exercised in
any other State under liko circumstances.
In the firat year of the last adminlstrz­
tipn, the proposition came up for the adr
mission of San Domingo as a territory of
the Union. It was not a question of my
seeking, but was an application from tbe
people of San Domingo; and which I en­
tertained. I believe now as I did then,
that it was the best interest of this country,
for tho people of San Domingo, and all con­
cerned, that the proposition should be re­
ceived favorably. It was, however, regard­
ed unconstitutional, and therefore tho sub­
ject was never brought up again by me.
In future, while I hold my present office,
the subject of acquisition of territory must
bave the support of the people before I will
recommend any proposition looking to such
acquisition. I say here, however, that I do
not share in the apprehension held by many
B? to the danger of governments becoming
weakened and destroyed by reason of their
extension of territory. Commerce, educa­
tion, the rapid transit of thought and mat
ter by telegraph and steam bave changed­
illthis. I rather bejieve that our great
Master'is preparing tha world, inhis'Qwn
good time, to b'scome one nation, speaking
one language, and when armies and 'navies
will be,no.ionger required. ""
My efforts in thejfuture . will'be directed

best serve to carry them into euect. i beg
your support and encouragement.
It Las been and it Is my earnest desire to
correct the abuses that bave grown up in
the civil service of the country. To secure
thl3 reformation, rules, regulations, meth­
ods in appointment and also promotion
bave been establlsneJ. My euorts for such
reformation shall ba continued to the best
of my judgment. The spirit of the rules
adopted will be maintained.
1 acknowledge before this Assembly,
representing as it does every section of our
country, tne obligation l am under to my
countrymen for the great honor they bave
conferred on me by returning me to the
Highest ouico witnin the land, and the
further obligation resting on me to render
tbem tne best services within my power:
looking forward with the greatest anxiety
to the day when 1 shall be released from
responsibilities, and that at times are al
most overwhelming, and from which I
have scarcely had a respite since the event
ful firing upon Fort -bumpter In 1801, to
the present day. My services were then
tendered and accepted under the first call
for troops growing out of tne event. 1 did
not ask for place or position, and was en
tirely witnout influence, or the acquaint
ance of persons of Intluence, and was re
solved to perform my part In a struggle
threatening tho very existence of the Na
tion. I performed a conscious duty
without asking promotion or command,
lout a revengeful fesling toward any
section or any Individuals.
Notwithstanding this, throughout the
war and from my candidacy for my present
office in 1SGS to the close of the last Presi
dential campaign, I have been the subject
of abuse and slander scarcely ever equaled
in political history, which to-day I feal that
I can afford lo disregard, in view of your
verdict which I gratefully accept as iny vin­
dication.The President's voice was not audible
except to those on or near the platform,
and consequently there were
Jfo Manifestations of Applause
or otherwise during its delivery, which oc­
cupied less than ten minutes, and was
completed before a large part of the assem
blage not directly in range of view knew
that it had been commenced. At the con­
clusion of tha address the President was
warmly congratulated Itr friend!, and soon
after left in bis carriage for the White
House, escorted by tbe procession, which
had reformed and taken up the line of
march. Most of the outside crowd fol­
lowed in tho same direction and tha rest
dispersed to their homes, while the Senate
returned to its chamber. The inauguration
ceremonies at the Capitol were concluded.
At tbe Wbite IXonsc.
Immediately in front of the White Houee
on Pennsylvania Avenue, a largo platform
had been erected, from which tha President
was to review the military. 1 he stand was
decorated with flags and streamers, and in
side it was handsomely upholstered and
contained seats for the President and party
of review. The stand was guarded trom
the throng of spectators by a few files of
soldiers and mounted police.
Shortly after the return irom the Capitol,
the President, marshaled by Secretary Rob­
eson and accompanied by nearly all tbe
Cabinet officers and their ladies, arrived
and took seats on tha platform. Mrs. Grant
and other ladies connected with the Pre3i:
dent's family, also took seats with the rest
of the parly on the stand. Just before the
arrival of the head of the column in the
vicinity of tbe stand, Gens. Sherman, Sher
idan and Howard, dressed in full uniform
and accompanied by ladies, walked up
through the crowd and took positions on
the stand.
The review was by far tho most impos
ing portion of military display, and more
than an hour was consumed in passing the
Pi03ident'. The different b.andg of music
performed spirited airs as they marched at
the head of theft respective companies, to
wLIch they were attached along the broad
avenue. The excellent drill and precise
discipline of the military was a theme of
great praise. I ho different organizations

""Thla league hall not in any manner

questions to the Republican national con­
vention of 189tJ with entire confidence

perity of our people and the continued'
glory and advancement of tho country.
It was urgued against the Patton sub­
stitute that the national league at its
last convention in Denver aud the
previous year at Louisville and at other
national conventions had adopted
recommendatory resolutions without
the constitutional objections ever being
raised aud the adoption of the substitute
would be accepted as a confession of
this convention's inability to meet the
silver issue. Although these arguments
poured in hot and fast, and Chairman
Robinson of Pennsylvania left the chair
to oppose it, yet the plan of ignoring
everything if the silver question was
ignored, gained such headway that the
Patton substitute was adopted at G:80 p.
m.. without a dissenting vote.
This will be presented to the conven­
tion and no doubt will be promptly
adopted.
As ""the address to the people ""that
was ruled out by the adoption of the
Patton substitute affirmed the resolu­
tions of previous national league con­
ventions there was much discussion of
the following adopted at Denver last
year:
""We bolieve in the use of gold and
silver as money metals, maintained on
a perfect parity and inconvertible. We
do not believe that there will be a per­
manent return vof prosperity until the
full use and highest positions of silver
shall be restored, and ask for such leg­
islation as will bring about this result.""

Confident of the Success of Free Silver
Four Years Hence.
New York, Nov. 30. In the December
number of the North American Review,
published to-morrow, William J. Bryan
presents an article, In which he dis­
cusses the result of the election as af­
fecting the status of the silver question.
The issue on which the election turns
he describes as ""The greatest issue ever
submitted to the American people in
time of peace.""
He says that the declaration of the
Chicago convention in favor of the free
coinage of silver forced upon the peo­
ple of this country a study of the
money question in general, and with­
in the last four months more people
have been simultaneously engaged in
its consideration than ever before in
the history of the world. The result of
this study, Mr. Bryan declares to be
a ""temporary defeat, but permanent
gain for the cause of bimetallism.""
Mr. Bryan regards it as a significant
fact that the silver sentiment was
strongest where the question had been
longest considered; that is to say, In
the west and south. The .gold senti­
ment prevailed in the eastern states,
but even there, in Mr. Bryan's opinion,

the cause of bimetallism made more
rapid progress than any other cause
ever made in such a short time. He
says that the odds against bimetallism
in the middle states were very great.
In Wisconsin and Minnesota, the demo­
cratic party declared against silver in
the conventions which sent delegates to
Chicago. In Michigan the convention
was nearly equally divided, and there
was a bitter contest within the party in
Iowa, Indiana and Ohio, while in Illi­
nois the hostile Influence of the Chica­
go press was greatly felt.
Mr. Bryan expresses his assurance
that the election can be by no means
regarded as a conclusive settlement of
the questions at issue. The advocates
of free coinage are convinced that they
are laboring in behalf of a large ma­
jority of the people, not only here, but
throughout the world; and they pro­
pose to continue their fight, confident
that the four years more of experience
will convince many who have thus far
resisted argument. This","news"

Vice-President of the United States, made Ga
by the National Convention­ of the Demo­
cratic party at St. Louis. When you did me
the.honor to call upon me at Columbus and
officially notify me of my nomination, I ex,
pressed toyou my sense of obligation to the
convention, and stated that, although I had
not sought the nomination, I did not feel pr
at liberty, under the circumstances, to de­ thi
line it. I thought theln, as I still think,
ur(
that whatever I could properly do to pro­ an
mote the reiilection of President Cleveland, sid
I ought to do. His administration has been 8n
marked by such ..integrity, good sense, nu
manly courage and exalted patriotism that Lc
a just appreciation of these high qualities bu
seem to call for his reelection. - am .also St
strongly impressed with the belief that his en
reilection would powerfully tend to ne
steengtheu thlat feeling of fraternity among
the American people that is so essential to sti
their welfare, peace and happiness, and to an
thd perpetuity of the Union and our free g
institutions. est
I-approve the platform of the St. Louis ri
Convention, and 1 cannot too strongly ex-. fie
press my dissent from the heretical teach­
ings of the monopolists that the welfare of to
people can be promoted by a system of ex­ w
horbitant taxation far in excess of the as
wants of the 'Governiment. The idea that. p
a people can be enriched by heavy and un-­ o,
necessary taxation, that a man's condition El
can be improved by taxing him on all he El
wears, on all his wife and children wear, wi
on all his tools and implements of industry, Ti
is an obvious absurdity. To fill the vaults
Pc
of the treasury with an idle surplus fo
which the Government has no legitimate Oi
use, and to thereby deprive the people of
currency needed for their business and
daily wants, and to create a powerful and Bo
dangerous stimulus to extravagance and TI
corruption in the expenditures of the Gov­
1
ernment, seems to me to be a policy at re
variance with every sound principle of gov­ a
ernment and of political economy. The PI
I necessity .of reducing taxation­ to prevent tli
such an accumulation of surplus revenue th
and the consequent depletion.of the circu­ w
Sla;ting medium, is so apparent that no party Of
dares to deny it; but, when we cone to
consider the modes by which.the reduction
may be made, we find a wide antagonism cl
S between our party and the monopolistic t
leaders of our political opponenfts. 1
We seek to reduce taxes upon the neces­ T
if
saries ·of life; our opponents seek to in­ PI
crease-them. We say, give­ tht s imasses of al
the people cheap and­ good clothing, cheap '
blankets, cheap tools and cheap lumber. bi
r The Republicans, by their platform, and n'
their leaders in the Senate by their pro­ Si
posed bill, say increase the takes on cloth­ G
ing and blankets, and thereby increase their fr
cost, maintain a high duty on the tools of sc
the. farmer and mechanic, and upon the
lumber which they need for the construe­
e tion of their modest dwellings, shops and C
barns, and thereby prevent their obtaining
if these necessaries at reasonable prices. Can
.I aivy sensible man doubt as to where lie i
d should stand in this controversy? Can any ci
well-informed man be deceived by the false
Lr
pretense that a system so unreasonable and v
u, just is for the­ benefit of the laboring I
man? Much is said about the competition
ir
of American laborers with the pauper labor l1
of Europe, but does not every man who
looks around him see and know that an im­
d inense majority of the laborers in America
are not engaged in what are called the pro­ P
tected., industries, and as to those who 1
is
are employed in such 'industries. I
ef
is it not undeniable that the duties t
- proposed by the Democratic measure called t:
the Mills Bill, far exceed the difference be­ p
s tween American and European wages, and u
re
that therefore if it were admitted that our
workingmen can, be protected by tariffs
y against cheaper labor, they would be fully
protected and more than protectcted by that
bill? Does not every informed man know
Je. that the increase of the price of home
manufactures, produced -by a high tariff,
y"" does not go into the pockets of the laboring
.s­ men, but only tends to swell the profits of
ae others? It.seems to ine that if the policy ot
.the Democratic party i, plainly presented, -
o all must understand that we seek to make
re the cost of living, less, and at the same time
increase the share of the laboring man in 1

Irish race throughout the world to sustain the
Irish people in the employment of all legiti
mate means to substitute for it national eelfr
government. .-i
J?olcei, That we pledge our unqualified
and constant support, moral and material, to
our countrymen In Ireland in their efforts to
recover their national self-government, and,
in order to more effectually promote this ob­
ject; by the consolidation of all our resources
and tho creation of ono responsible and au­
thoritative body to speak for greater Ireland

Charles Stewart Parnell Is President. '

sentiment of Uishop Butler, of Limerick, that
every stroke of Forsfcer's savage lash was for
Irishmen a new proof of Parnell s worth, and
an additional title for him to the confidence
and gratitnde of his countrymen.
Resolved, That we sympathize with the labor­
ers of Ireland In their efforts to Improve their
condition, and as we have sustained the farm­
ers in their assaults upon the landlord gar­
rison, we now urge upon farmers justice and
humane consideration for laborers. Jn the
words for the employment of which an Irish

demand that farmers allow laborers afair

Afnoiwl, That as tho manufacturers of

earnestly counsel our countrymen in Ireland
to buy nothing in England which they can
produce in Ireland or procure from America
or France, and we pledge ourselves to pro­

their Import into America, and to use the Ut­
most endeavors by plain statements of facts

laousana citizens or Ireland without accusa­
tion or trial, a number of whom were noble­
hearted women, engaged in works of mercy
among evicted victims of landlord rapacity
and English few.

Kev. John O'Connor, iilshop of Omaha; Kt.
Kev. John Lancaster Spalding, Bishop of
Peoria: Host ltev. John Y llliams. Archbishon

efficient efforts in providing homes for Irish
immigrants in the United states. The people
of Ireland are by law of lod and nature en­
titled to live by their labor in their native
land, whose fertile soil Is abundantly able to
nourish them, but since a brutal Government
compels la r ire numbers to emigrate, it is the
duty r their countrymen to warn them
against the snares of iovertyin large cities,
and assist them in agricultural regions.
Reaoted, That tho policy of the English Gov­
ernment in first reducing thp Irish peasantry
to abject poverty, and then sending theic
penniless to the United States, dependent
upon American charity.is unuatural.lnhumar
and an outrage upon the American Gov
ernment and people. We respectfully
direct the attention of tho United State'
Government to this iniquity. We protest
against its continuance, and we instruct the
officials who shall be chosen by this conven­
tion to present our protest to the President ol
the United States and respectfully but firmly
to urge upon the President that it is Jthe duty
of the Government of the United State to de­

began under, and is the result of. English mis­

Bhe send no more of her paupers to these

Captain had lurnished all ihe information by
giving him the names of witnesses and by
sending his men before the Judge.

ofthe publication in the press of the legal pro­

THE eiFFKXSIVK .MATTA N'dTK.
December 13th was broached one of the
gravest issues in the ciso, which i.s still open
in the shape of the Matta note to Chilean'
Ministers abroad. Mr. Kgan Bays in this tele­
gram that this was sent tothe Chilean Minis­
ter at Washington with the sanction ot the
President, was read tn the Senate and pub­
lished in ail the papers. Its text in full is as
follows :

•Having read the portions of the report of
the Secretary of the Navy and of the message
of the President of the United States, I think
proper to inform you that the statements on
which both the report and the message aro
based are erroneous or deliberately incorrect.
With respect to tbe persons to whom an asy­
lum has bean granted, they have never been
threatened with cruel treatment, nor has it
been sought to remove tbem from the lega­
tion, nor -uaa their surrender been asked tor;
never has tin- house or the person of the Pleni­
potentiary — notwithstanding indiscretions
and deliberate persecutions—oeen subjected to
any offense, as is proven hv the eleven notes
ol September, October and November, with
respect to the.seamen of the Baltimore, .'here
is, moreover, no exactness or sincerity in
what is said at Washington. The occurrence
took place iv a bad neignbornood of the city—
the maintop of Valparaiso—and among peo­
ple who are not models of discretion and tem­
perance. When the police and other forces
entered and calmed the tumult, there were
already several hundred people on tbe ground,
and it was ten squares or more from the place
Where it had begun.
""Mr. Egan sent, on the 28th of October, a
war note that was aggressive in purpose anel
virulent in language, as is seen by the copy
and the note written in reply on the 27th. Oil
the 18th the preliminary examinution had
already been commenced. It has been de­
layeel owing to the uon appearance of the offi­
e rs of the Baltimore, a:id owing to undue
pretensions and the refusal of Mr. Egan him­
self.

""No provocation has over beenjaccepted or
initiated by this department, its attitude,
while it nas ever been one Ol firmness an I
prudence, lias never been oneofaggn
ness. nor will it ever be one of humiliation,
whatever may be or have been said at Wash­
ington by those who are Interested in justify­
ing their conduct, or wno are blinded by er­
roneous views. The telegrams, notes and
letters which have been sent to you contain
the truth, the whole truth, in connection with
what has taken place in these matters, in
which ill-will and the consequent words and
pretensions have noteminated from this de­
partment.
""Mr. Tracy and Mr. Harrison have been led
into error in respect to our people and Gov­
ernment. The instructions recommending
impartiality and friendship have notbeen
complied with, neither now or before. If no
Official complaint has been made against tiie
Minister and the naval officers, it is because
tacts—public and notorious both in Chile and
itie United States—could not. although they
wore well proved, be urged by our confiden­
tial agents. Proof of this is furnished by the
demands of the Baltimore and the con­
cessions made in June and July, and the
whole Itata ease,i he San Francisco at Quintero
and the cable companies. .The statement that
the North Americans were attacked in vari­
ous locations at the same time, is deliberately
incorrect. As the preliminary examination
is not yet concluded, it is not yet known who
and how many the guilty parties are.
""You no doubt have the note of November
9th, written In reply to Minister Egan, in
which I request him to furnish testimony
which he would not give, although he has
said he had evidence snowing who the mur­
derer was, and who the otiier guilty parties of
the 16th ot October were.
••All the other notes will be published here,
and you will publish a translation of them in
the United States. Deny in the meantime
everything that does not agree with these
statements, being assured of their exactness,
as we are oi the right, dignity and final success

comes from so high a source.""

it. The rule upon which I acted was, that every
citizen presenting a respectful petition lo the
body that by the constitution had (he power to
grant or lefuse the prayer of it, was entitled to be
heard; and therefore the petition ought to be recei­
ved and considered. If right and reasonable, the
prayer of it should be granted; hut if wrong Or
unreasonable, it should be denied. I think all
my votes, whether on the reception of petitions or
the consideration of resolutions, will be found
consistent with this rule.
1 have none of my congressional documents
here, they being at my former rtsidence in Buffa­
lo, nor have 1 access lo any papers or memoranda
to refresh my recollection; but 1 think at some
time while in Congress, I took occasion to state
in substance my views on the subject of slavery
in the States. Whether the remarks were repor­
ted or not I am unible to say, but the substance
was, that I legarded slavery as an evil, but one
with which the National Government had nothing
lo do. That by the constitution of the' United
Slates the whole power over that question was
vested in the several States where institutions was
tolerated, If they regarded it as a blessing, they
had a constitutional right to enjoy it, and if they
regarded it as an evil they had the power and
knew best how to apply the remedy. I did not
conceive that Congress had any power over it, or
wes in any wrjy responsible for its continuonce
in ihe several States where it existed. I have
entertained no other sentiments on this subject
since I examined il sufficiently to fotm an opin­
ion, and I doubt not that all my acts, public and
private, will bn found in accordance with this
view. I have the honor to be, your obedient ser­
vant, - MILLARD FILLMORE.

Veto of the Arkansas Bill.
The President has transmitted to the
House the following message, return­
ing with his objections the bill for the
admission of Arkansas:
To the House of Representatives :
I return without my signature a bill
entitled ""An Act to admit the State
of Arkansas to representation in Con­
gress."" '
The approval of this bill would bean
I admission on the part of the Execu­
tive that the ""Act for the more effi­
cient government of the rebel States,""
passed March 2d, 18G7, and the act sup­
plementary thereto, were proper and
constitutional. My opinion, however,
in reference to these measures lias un­
dergone no change, but on the contrary,
has been strengthened by the results
which have attended their execution.
Even were this not the case, I could j
not consent to a bill which is based,
upon the assumption either that by an i
act of rebellion of a portion of its peo­
ple the State of Arkansas seceded from
the Union, or that Congress may at its j
pleasure, expel or exclude a State from
the Union, or interrupt its relations j
with the Government byarbitarily de-j
priving it of representation in the Sen­
ate and House of Representatives. If
Arkansas is a State not in the Union,
this bill does not admit it as a State in­
to the Union. If, on the other hand,
Arkansas is a State in the Union, no |
legislation is necessary to declare it en-j
titled ""to representation in Congress as
one of the States of the Union."" The |
Constitution already declares that'
""each State shall have at least one Rep-1
resentative;"" ""that the Senate shall be j
composed of two Senators from each ;
State and ""that no State without its
consent shall be deprived of its suf­
frage in the Senate."" That instru­
ment also makes each House ""thejudg­
es of the elections, returns and quallG­
cations of its own members,"" and
therefore all that is now neeessarty to
restore Arkansas in all its constitution­
al relations to the Government is the
decision by each House upon the eligi­
bility of those who, presenting their
credentials, claim seats in the respec­
tive Houses of Congress. This is the
plain and simple plan of the Constitu­
tion ; and believing that had it been
pursued when Congress assembled in
the month of December, ISGS, the re­
storation of the States would long since
have been completed, I o.nce again re­
commend that it be adopted -Aft &lt;each
House, in preference to"" legislation
which I respectfully submit is not only
of at least doubtful constitutionality,
and therefore unwise and dangerous as
a precedent, but is unnecessary, not so
effective in its operation as the mode
prescribed by the Constitution, in­
volves the additional delay, and from
its terms may be taken rather as appli­
cable to a Territory about to be admit­
ted as one of the United States than to
a State which has occupied a place in
the Union for upwards of a quarter of a
century.
The bill declares the State of Arkan­
sas entitled and admitted to represen­
tation in Congress as one of the States
of the Union upon the following funda­
mental condition:
That the constitution of Arkansas
shall never be so amended or changed
as to deprive any citizen or class of
citizens of the United States of the
right to vote who are entitled to vote j
by the constitution herein recognized,:
except as a punishment for such crimes ;
as are now felonies at common law,'
whereof they shall be duly convicted)
under laws equally applicable to all
the inhabitants of said State. Provided, .
Thai any alteration of said constitution,
prospective in its affect, may be made
in regard to the time and place of resi­
dence of voters.
I have been unable to find in the
Constitution of the United States any j
warrant for the exercise of the authori­
ty thus claimed by Congress. In as-,
suming the power to impose a ""funda-1
mental condition"" upon a State which
has been duly admitted into the LTiion
on an equal footing with the original |
States, in all respects whatever, Con-1
gress asserts a right to enter a State as j
it may a Territory, and to regulate the
highest prerogative of a free people—!
the elective franchise. This question
is reserved by the Constitution to the
States themselves, and to concede to
Congress the power to regulate this
subject would be to reverse the funda­
mental principle of the Republic, and
to place in the hands of the Federal
Government (which is the creature of
the States) the sovereignty which just­
ly belongs to the States or the people,
to the true source of all political power
by whom our federal system was crea­
ted, and to whose will all is subordi­
nate.
The bill fails to provide in what man­
ner the State of Arkansas is to signify
its acceptance of the ""fundamental
condition"" which Congress endeavors
to make unalterable and irrevocable.
Nor does it prescribe the penalty to be
imposed should the people of the State
amend or change the particular por­
tions of the constitution which it is one
of the purposes of the bill to perpetu­
ate, but leaves them in uncertainty and
doubt as to the consequences of such i
action, when the circumstances under
which this constitution has been
brought to the attention of Congress
are considered. It is not unreasonable
to suppose that efforts will be made to

modify his provisions, and especially
those in respect to which this measure
prohibits any alteration. It is serious­
ly questioned whether the constitution
has been ratified by a majority of the
persons who, under the act of March
2d, 1867, and the acts supplementary
thereto, were entitled to registration
and to vote upon that issue. Section
ten of the schedule provides that ""no
person disqualified from voting or reg­
istering under this constitution shall
vote for candidiases for any office, nor
slutll be permitted to vote for the rati­
fication or rejection ofthe constitution
at the polls herein authorized."" As­
sumed to be in force before its adop­
tion, in disregard of the law of Con­
gress, the constitution undertakes to
impose upon the elector other and furth­
er conditions. The fifth section of the
eighth article provides that ""all per­
sons, before registering or voting,""
must take and subscribe an oath which,
among others, contains the following
clause:
""That I accept the civil and political
equality of all men, and agree not to
attempt to deprive any person or per­
sons, on account of race, color, or pre­
vious condition, of any political or civ­
il right, privileged, or immunity en­
joyed by an3* other class of men.""
It is well known that a very large
portion of the electors in all the States,
if not a large majority of all of them,
do not believe in or accept the politi­
cal equalit3r of Indians, Mongolians, or
negroes with the race to which the3r be­
long. If the voters of maii3* ofthe
States of the North and West were re­
quired to take such an oath as a test of
their qualification, there is reason to
believe that a majority of them would
remain from the polls rather than com­
ply with its degrading conditions.
How far and to what extent this test
oath prevented the registration of those
who were qualified under the laws of
Congress, it is not possible to know;
but that such was its effect, at least
sufficient to overcome them all and
give a doubtful majoritj' in favor of
this constitution, there can be no reas­
onable doubt.
Should the people of Arkansas,
therefore, desiring to regulate the elec­
tive franchise so as to make it conform
to the constitutions of a large propor­
tion ofthe States of the North and
West, modify the provisions referred
to in the ""fundamental condition,""
what is to be the consequence? Is it
intended that a denial of representa­
tion shall follow? And if so, may we
not dread, at some future da>r, a recur­
rence of the troubles which have so
long agitated the country? Would it
not be the part of wisdom to take for
our guide the Federal Constitution, rath­
er than resort to measures which, look­
ing only to the present, may in a few
3*ears renew, in an aggravated form,
the strife and bitterness caused b>' leg­
islation which has proved to be ill­
timed and unfortunate.

WASHINGTON, June 20,18G8.

A BEAUTIFUL INCIDENT","news"
"48","17180071006","Rural Free De­
livery a Costly Experiment.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25. Postmaster­
general W. S. BIssell has submitted to the
President his annual report for the year
ending June 20, 1S34. He briefly outlines the
policy of the department In the following:
""In general I would recommend that the
first and most important thing to be done
is to revise the law as to second-class mat­
ter so. as to place the Postofflce Department
immediately upon a self-sustaining basis.
""Second--Avoid expensive experiments, like
thepostal telegraph, rural free delivery, etc
""Third Develop the postal service on ex­
isting, lines of administration, namely, ex­
tend free delivery in cities that now enjoy
it; accord it to towns already entitled to
it under the law; quicken railroad trans­
portation.""Fourth Revise and re-classlfy organiza­
tion of the railway mail service and re­
classify clerks In postofflces.
""Fifth Provide for district supervision of
all postal affairs by appointment of expert
postal officials from classified service, as
recommended in my last annual report.""
Mr. - BIssell first discusses the effect of
the continued depression upon the postal
revenues, and says: ""When adverse busi­
ness conditions prevail an ordinary business
establishment, may overcome them in part
byj economies In management and retrench­
ment in expenditures. Not so, however,
with ' the postofflce establishment of the
government. It cannot and should not stop
to ; consider little economies. Its duties and
obligations to the public become at once
intensified and enlarged.""
The revenue for the year was $75,080,470;
expenditures, $84,324,414, leaving a deficiency
of. $5,243,935. The estimates for the current
year ending June 30, 1895, are: Revenue,
$S4.427.74S; expenditures. $30.339.4S5; deficiency,
J5.971.737. The estimates submitted to - the
Secretary of the Treasury for the next
fiscal year are: Revenue, $86,907,407; expen­
ditures, $91,0C9.283: deficiency, $4,151,876.
- This annual deficiency the Postmaster­
general says, could be overcome by the in­
crease or postal rates, but he does not be­
lieve - this advisable. Economy hs been
practiced, but nevertheless great care has
been taken that tt should not effect the
efficiency of the service. The economies
have consisted mainly In re-lettlng contracts
for mall transportation, and In the cost and
amount of supplies; also in the abrogation
of seven of the eleven steamship subsidy
contracts, which will m.an a total saving
in-the ten years of the contract's life oi
H4,431,325.v
OPPOSED TO RURAL. FREE DELIVERY.
Mr. BIssell recommends that the experi­
mental free delivery projects should be dis­
continued, and thinks that free delivery
in"" rural districts is not needed or desired
by the people. Both of these projects were
originated by his predecessor.
He refers to the war made by the de­
partment on lottery schemes passing under
the name of ""bond investment companies,""
. and says It has been waged successfully.
He recommends ths enactment of laws cov­
ered In bills now pending before Congress
""for the further suppression of lotteries.
f.-frthewobstrueLion of mails by strikes
rthe Postmaster-general says: ""In my last
report I called attention to the necessity
for legislation such as then was and is now
i-ecommended ""by the superintendent of the
railway mall service for the punishment of
train wrecking, and for legislative deter­
mination and definition of a mail train.
Such legislation would be of great advan­
:age to the postal service.""
One of the most Important and interesting
features of Mr. Blsseli's report Is the d.s
cussion of class matter. In his last re­
port he referred to the great disproportion
.f( growth of second-class mail matter. He
has made a th6rough Investigation during
che year, upon which he says: ' x'he effect
of all this upon my mind Is a conviction
that the statutes and the precedents upon
which the business now rests are defective;
that they embody the only great abuse at
present- existing In the postal service, and
that . as this abuse is growing all the time
some remedy should be applied."" He gives
figures for the past six years showing that
in 1SS8 the we.ght of second-class matter
carried was 143.000,000 pounds, and in 1S93
It ; was 253,000,000. During the year 1M)4
there was carried 451,000,000 pounds of all
mail matter, of which 239,000,000 pounds was
second-class matter, the toml cost being
$3'j,207,&amp;82, an average of 8 cents a pound.
Returns from postmasters show that the
amount upon which postage at the rate o
l cent per pound was-paid was 254,000,000
pounds, the remaining 45,000,000 pounds be­
ing matter carried free in the county of
publication. The co3t of carrying thesecond-class
matter was 120,320,000, while at
the rate of 1 cent a pound the collections
were $2,547,000, and $800,000 special local
rates In carrier cities, leaving a net loss
to the government of $16,973,000.
; SERIALS CONDEMNED.
After giving these figures, thePostmaster-general
continues: ""This calculation
applies to transportation alone. The sep­
arate cost of distribution and delivery I will
not attempt to estimate, but any one can
see that those items' of expenditure would
largely swell the loss. I do not advocate a
change of rates now upon legitimate news­
papers and periodical magazines. My pur­
pose is to urge the withdrawal of low post­
age rates from the large cities and the pre­
tended periodicals that are now improperly
enjoying them. The most conspicuous class,
of these pretended periodicals are what are
now generally known as serialpaper-covered
'books. They are in no sense serial,
however except in name, being usually
given some such general designation as the
Fireside Series,' the 'Detective Library
or some other title of like character. They
are nothing but books, pure and simple, and
many of them very trashy books at that,
each one distinct in itself, the 'series' never
being devoted to anything in particular,
having few subscribers, and with no real
subscription price.
""Another class of publications now large­
ly enjoying the low postage accorded to
second-class matter Is what has got to be
known as the 'House Organ,' being simply
a paper or pamphlet devotecKmalnly to the
advertising of some mticant.le, manufactur­
ing or other establishment, but purporting
to be devoted to trade, claiming a bona fide
list of subscribers, and nominally conform­
ing to other conditions of second-class mat
ter, the bogus trade paper, not devoted
to the advertising of any particular house,
Is another illustration of the same abuse
of the mails.
. ""Of great moment in connection with the
abuse I am discussing is the privilege
given to publishers of newspapers and mag­
azines the first bestowal of which wasun-dcMbx-ac;
of March 3, 1SS5 to mall sample
copies thereof at the pound rate of post­
age. But for this too liberal privilege I
am inclined to think that the very few
really Illegitimate trade papers would ever
have been admitted to the malls as second­
class matter.""
After commenting on the great increase
in the mailing of fraternal insurance pub­
lications as second-class matter, and show­
ing the .enormous increase of them since
the act of Congress admitting them. Mr.
BIssell suggests the remedy in the follow­
ing: ""If it be the policy of Congress to
continue the privileges of second-class
rates to benevolent or fraternal societies,
then the remedy I would suggest would be
an amendment of the law limiting this
rate to them and to legitimate newspapers
and legitimate periodical magazines. I be­
lieve that one year's experience under such
limitations would demonstrate all leg tlmate
newspapers and periodical magaz.nes may
be transmitted through our mails from pub­
lishers into the hands of subscribers free of
all cost.""
POSTAL TELEGRAPH NOT WANTED.
The Postmaster-general does not favor
the postal telegraph, a system advocated
by his predecessor. The conditions In this
country, he says, are such as would enor­
mously Increase the largest deficit. He
takes as example th system in Great
Britain, which is a comparatively small
territory, and shows that the postal tele­
graph entails a total annual .loss of about
$2,000,000. He points out that) in a country
where the' territory is so larite the cost of

a postal telegraph would far exceed any

Mr. BIssell gives the following dally av­
erage business of the department, which
shows thr vastness of the postal serv'ce:
Number cf miles of post route run. 1.100.000;
stamps manufactured, 8,300.0X); envelopes
manufactured. l.SUO.OuO; postal cards man­
ufactured. l.f.00.000: r.leces mailed. 15,700.000;

dead-letter office, 24,000; dally transactions
in monev-order business, $1,100,000; daily ex­
penses, $231,100. The Postmaster-general be­
lieves in civil service in the Postofflce De­
partment He says: ""If the sys­
tem has produced such good results
in the clerical force of the department, it
Is reasonable to Inquire whether something
like it could not be applied with advantage
to the lower grades of postmasters For
more than one generation the American peo­
ple have been trained to regard the post­
oftlce as inseparable from the varying for­
tunes cf the two great political parties,
and in some instances, even, as legitimately
following the vicissitudes of mere factions
within a party. This fallacy is to be de­
plored. The intelligence of our people has
long outgrown the notion that any one po­
litical party enjoys a monopoly of adminis­
trative talent. The local postofflce is closely
connected with the every-day life of the
people who patronize it, and nothing Is
further from . the principles of home rule
and majority rule than to force a change
whatever. Yet this is what happens and
is bound to happen as long as the post­
offlces remain in the public mind, and hence
in the practice of the government, asso­
ciated with politics. The postal service
must either be taken out of the political
field altogether and surrounded with the
same conditions which conduce to the
health of a private business or be divided,
for administrative purposes, into two sec­
tions, 'the one political and the other non­
polltlcal, each under a separate head, so
that the executive authority on the non­
political side shall not be required to give
any of his thoughts to the improvement of
the postal pystem.""
Mr. Bissell refers to the. bill now pending
In Congress to relieve thePostmaster-general
of the responsibility of postofflce ap­
pointments. Commenting upon this bill, the
Postmaster-general says: ""Whether such
a plan is or is not the best that can be de­
vised, it is at least the formulation of a
plan which is entitled to the most earnest,
careful and immediate consideration and
may become a foundation upon which to
bjild. What is earnestly desired, and what
dally appears more of a necessity, is leg­
islation of some kind which will insure an
improvement upon present methods.""
Mr. Bissell closes his report with a re­
quest that a new building be provided for
the Postofflce Department. He says Interest
on the cost of an adequate building would
be less than the amount of rent paid.

Dismissal, Says Court-Presi*
dent Changes It to Suspension.
The War lnvestigation Report is
Completed and Adopted.
Washington, Feb. 7.-The President to­
day promulgated the sentence in the
case of Gen. Eagail.
The court martial sentence was die­
missal from the army. and the President
has commuted this to six years' sus­
pensiod from duty, twhich covers the
remainder of 'the time, prior to Gen
Eagan's retirement in January, 1905.
This is the text of6 the order of the.
President:­
The accused, after a trial by a court
martial. composed of officers of. high
rank anddistinguished services, -has
been found guilty of: conduct unworthy
un officer hOlding a commlssloh of the
United States and­ obnoxious In, the
higheut degree tof the discipline and
good order of the military establishment.
Such behavior is especially deserv.ng of
condemnation in an officer holding high.
rank in the army and charged with the
performance of difficult'and important
udministrative duties in a time of great
public emergency, and from whiom, when
subjected, to adversen criticism, an un­
usual degree of restraint and constant
and unfailing self-control are confidentlyo
expected.
The -proceedings, findings and sen­
tence in the case of BIrigadier Gen. C. P.
Pagan, icommissary general of subsist­
ence, United States army, are therefore
approved. .
In view, howevert of his gallant con­
duct In battle, on more than one oeea­
-Eton, which merited' and has received the
warm commendation'of his superiors,
and of his long and honorable record of
service, extending. over a period sur­
passing In duration that usually allot­
ted to a generation, having regard also
to, the mitigating circumstances which
were developed during theltrial of the
case, and iln deference to the recom­
mendation to clemency submitted in his
behalf, the. sentence imposed by the
court is commuted to_ suspenslon from
rank and duty for six years.'
S:It was stated by Adj, Gen. Corbin that
Gen. Eagan's suspension carries hm, to
within a few days of his retlrement un­
dler the age limit. He will be reinstated
in time to retire with the regular rank
and pay provided in-such eases:. - -
The sentence of suspenslon, according
to the legal officers of the department,
does not-deprlve Gen. Eagan of any part
of his pay,' but, as the sentence reads,
""without rank and duty."" he loses his
allowances, which include commutation
of quarters, rations and fuel and his
horse allowance. This is quite ,a large
financial item.

There are men in this community, by
whom you have been deceeived for years,
and who now tell you that the Convention
by which Douglas was nominated did not
pass aresolution endorsing the Dred Scott
Decision; and then go still further and
say that, even if it didthe decision is not
susceptible of the construction we give it.
For your benefit we pub'ish'tbat resolution
as adopted by the Douglas Convention.
Here it is:
""Resolved. That it is in accordance
with the Cincinnati Platform, that during
the existence of Territorial Governments
the measure of restriction, whatever it
may be, imposed by the Federal Consti­
tution on the power of the Territorial
Legislature over the subject of the do­
mestic relations as the sums has been, or
shall hereafter be finally determined by
the Supreme Court of Hie United States,
should be respected by all good citizens,
and enforced with promptness and fi­
delity by every branch of the General
Government. . ,
Now, we propose to give you what is
decided by the Dred Scott Decision, and
for that purpose we will go to the moke.
In the I9th volume of Howard's Reports,
page 3.)5, will be found the syllabus of
this same Dred Scott Decision. Here are
the points decided:
1st. ""The territory thus acquired is
acquired by the people of the United
Slates for their common and equal bene­
fit, through their agent and trustee, the
Federal Government. Congress can
exercise no power ovpt the rightsof-persons
or property of a citizen in tha Terri­
tory which is prohibited by the Constitu
tion. Ihe Government and the citizen,
whenever the Territory is open to settle­
ment, both enter it with their respective
rights defined nnd limited by the Consti­
tution.""2d. ""Conp-reas have no rijrht to pro
hibit the citizens of any particular State
or States from taking up their home there
while it permits citizens of other Stales to
do so. In or has it a right to give pnvi
leges to one class ol citizens which it
reluses to another. The Territory is ac
quired for their equal and common bene
fit, and if open to any it must be open to
all upon equal and the same terms.""
3d, ""Evert o.tizem has a biobt to
TAKE WITH HIM'lNTO THE TlF.RITORV ANY
ARTICLE OF PROPERTY WHICH THE CONSTI
TUTION of the United States recognizes
AS PROPERTY.""
4th. The Constitution of thh United
States recognizes slaves as property,
and pledges the federal government
to protect it. And Congress cannot
exercise any more authority over proper
ty ot til at description than it may con­
stitutionally exercise over property of any
other kind.""
5th. ""The act of Congress, therefore,
prohibiting a citizen of the United Stales
taking with him his slaves when he re­
moves to the Territory in question to re
side, is AN EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY OVER
PRIVATE PROPERTY WHICH IS NOT WARRAN­
TED by the Constitution, and the re­
moval of the plaintiff by his owner to
that Territory gave him no title to free­
dom.""9th. ""While it remains a Territory
Congress may legislate over it within the
scope of its constitutional powerB in rela­
tion to citizens of the United States, and
may establish a territorial government,
the form of this local Government must be
regulated by the discretion of Congress;
but with powers not exceeding those
which Congress itself by the Constitution
is authorized to exercise over citizens of
the United States in respect to their
rights ol persons or rights of property.

and important modifications applied to the status quo
i ante 6ellum. I believe we may say that the common
l interest of Europe requires­
a First. That the protectorate hitherto exercised by
R the imperial court of Russia ever the principalities
l of Wallachia, Moldavia, and Servia, shall cease, and
that tAse privileges granted by the Sultans to these
dependent provinces of their empire shall, in virtue
of an arrangement with the Sublime Porte, be placed
under the collective guarantee of the Powers.
. Second. That the navigation of the Danube, as far
3as to its outfall into the Black Sea, shall be delivered
I from all restriction, and submitted to the operation
bof the principles consecrated by the acts of the Con­
gress of Vienna.
Third. That the Treaty of July 13, 1841*, shall be
revised in concert by the high contracting powers in I
the interest of the European equilibrium, and in the
sense of a limitation of Russian power in the Black C
Sea.
Fourth. That no power shall claim the right to
f exercise any official protectorate over the subjects of
the Sublime Porte, to whatever rite they may belong. c
but that France, Austria, Great Britain, Prussia, and t
Russia shall lend their mutual co-operation, in order r
to obtain from the initiative of the Ottoman govern­
ment the consecration and observance of the religious
privileges of the various Christian communities, and
turn the generous intdntions manifested by his it
Majesty the Sultan to the account of their various
co-religionists, sD that there shall not result there­ d
from any infringement of the dignity and independ­ f
G
ence of his crown. t
Should the conference re-assemble, I hope it may be C
able to recognise that none of the ideas which I
n
have just expressed deviate from the protocol ot,
April 9, and even that it was difficult to include 8
within more moderate limits the research which t,
France, Austria, Great Britain, and Prussia formally t,
engaged at that date to make on the subject of the
most proper means of consolidating the Turkish em­ r
t
pire, and bringing it into the general equilibrium of I
Europe. The recent communications of Baron Hubner a
authorise me already to say that the opinion of Count
Buol will coincide with mine, and that he regards,
as I do, the guarantees which Europe has a right
to demand of Russia in order not to be exposed to
the renewal of the same complications.
Such, M. Le Baron, is the reply which the Em­
peror has ordered me to make to the contents of the
despatch of Count Nesselrode. You will be good
enough to give a copy of it to Count Buol, and ask
him, if there is an opportunity, to convoke the con­
ference to hear it read. 8
To sum up, the document which emanates from the f
Cabinet of St. Petersburg does not in anywise
t
change the respective situations; and in the t
opinion of the government of his Imperial
Majesty, it will serve only to define them
with much greater distinctness. Since Russia has I
yet to make known her intentions in a practical and
positive manner, France and England persist in their e
attitude of belligerent powers; and since the Princi­
palities are not yet evacuated, Prussia end Austria c
will doubtlessjudge that the obligations which result

had occurred? A change of administra­
tion; all branches of the government had
been entrusted to the Democratic party,
which was committed against the protec­

edly for more than thirty-two years and
brought unexampled prosperity to the
country, and firmly pledged to Its complete
overthrow and the substitution of a tariff
for revenue only. The change having been
decreed by the elections in November, its
effects were at once anticipated and felt.
We cannot close our eyes to these altered
conditions, nor would it be wise to exclude
from contemplation and investigation the
causes which produced them. They are
facts which we cannot as a people disre­

announced this evening that he hud com­
pleted his Cabinet by the selection of
Richard Olney, of Boston, for Attorney­
general, and Hilary A. Herbert, of Ala
bama, for Secretary of the Navy. The com­
pleted Cabinet is as follows:
WALTER Q. CBESHAM.of Indiana, Secretary
of State.
JOHN G. CARLISLE, of Kentucky, Secretary
of the Treasury.
DANIEL 8. LAMONT, of New York, Secretary
of War. '

master general.
lilCllAHD OLNEY, of Massachusetts,Attorney-general.
The seleotion of ITilary A. Herbert for
the navy has been expected for several
days, but Mr. Olney's name had not been
mentioned in connection with the Cabinet,
and his selection is a surprise to every­
body, particularly to the friends of George
A. Jenks.
Hilary A. Herbert has been in Congress
for many years, and has acted as chairman
of the naval committee of the House. He
is thoroughly familiar with the work that
has been done toward placing the United
States navy on a proper footing, and his
knowledge of the present condition of the
vessels under construction, and which
have been planned, makes him a most de­
sirable man for the head of the depart
ment. His selection is also practically a
promotion.
Mr. Richard Olney is one of tho leading
practitioners of tho Massachusetts bar.
He has not held any political position or
been prominent in political matters, but is
known as one of the leading lawyers and
substantial oitizens of Boston. His selec
tion gives New England a representative
in the Cabinet, and that of Herbert gives
the Sonth three positions.
Mr. Cleveland's callers to-day were Dan
iel S. Laroont and Mrs. Latuont, who ar
rived from York at 3:30 p. M. and left at C
o'clock, and Father Larkin and Capt. P. J.
Cunningham, of Washington. Fatlier Lar­
kin is an ex-chaplain in the army and Capt.
Cunningham has a position in the War
Denartment. Their call was, they said
purely a patriotic, visit to tho President
elect on Washington's birthday. Mr.
Cleveland remained at home all day.

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
SFelloo-citizens of the Senate and House of jt
Representatives-With great gratitude to the c(
bountiful giver of all good I congratulate you r
at the beginning of your first regular session. m
You find our country blessed with -health and I
peace, and abundant harvests, and with en­ w
couraging prospects of an early return of el
s
general prosperity to conplete and make per­ ct
manent. The pacification of the country con­ a]
8
tinues to be, and until it is fully accomplished it
must remain the most important, of all our na­
tional interests. The earnest purpose of good p
citizens generally to unite their efforts in tl
those endeavors is evident. It found decided St
expression in the resolution announced le
in 1876 by the National C'onvention
of the leading political parties of the t'
country. There was a widespread apprehen­ t,
a sion that the momentous results in our prog­ n
ress as a nation marked by the recent amend­ a
ment to the Constitu~tion, were in imminent v
i. jeopa;dy; that the good understanding which t(
prompted their adoption in the interest of a a
loyal devotion to the general welfare, might a:
prove a barren truce, and that the sections of n
the country once engaged in civil strife might it
be again almost as widely severed and disunit­ e:
ed as they were when arrayed in arms against a
each other. The course to be pursued which
in my judgment seemed wisest in the presence li
of emergency, was plainly indicated in my in­ a
augural address. It pointed to the time which e
all our people desire to see, when a genuine v
love of our whole country and of all that con­
cerns its true welfare, shall supplant the de­
structive forces of mutual animosity, of races, a
d of sectional hostility. Opinions have differed ,
widely as to the measures best calculated to a:
secure this great end. This was to be ex­ ii
pected. The measures adopted by r
the administration have been subject­ ii
ed to severe and varied criticisms. n
Any course whatever which might have been o
entered upon would certainly have encoun­ I
f ter-l, distrust and opposition. These meas­ n
ures were, in my judgment, such as were most r
in harmony with the constitution and with the v
genius of our people, and best adapted under a
all the circumstances to attain the end in view. v
d Beneficent results ahleady apparent prove that
* these endeavors are not to be regarded as a
mere experiment, and should sustain and en­ o
courage us in our efforts. Already in the brief c
period which has elapsed the immediate effect­ I
iveness, no less than the justice of the course t
. pursued, is demonstrated, and I have an abid­ e
in g faith that time will furnish its ample vin­ 1,
tt dication in the minds of the great majority of g
my fellow citizens. t
n The discontinuance of the use of the army t,
for the purpose of upholding local govern­ a
ments in two States of the Union was no less a
a constitutional duty and requirement v
under the circumstances existing at the time b
than it was a much needed measure for the v
restoration of local self-government and the h
promotion of national harmony. The with­ hI
drawal of the troops from such employment II
was effected deliberately, and with solicitous d
care for the peace and good order of society p
and the protection of property and persons, t]
[l. and every right of all classes of citizens. The ii
i­ results that have followed are indeed signifi­ p
'Y
cant and encouraging. All apprehension of d
danger from remitting those states to local self­ is
government is dispelled, and a most salutory o.
1I change in the minds of the people has begun n
y and is in progress in every part of that section is
ie
of country, once the theater of G
'a unhappy civil strife, substituting S
' for suspicion, distrust and aversion, v
concord, friendship and patriotic attachment fi
te
to the Union. No unprejudiced mind will it
if deny that the fatal collisions which for several u
I years have been of frequent occurrence, and a
have alarmed the public minds, have almost ri
e entirely ceased; and that a spirit of mutual vn
st forbearance and hearty national interest has n
r succeeded. There has been a general reestab­ ii
ment of order and of the orderly administra­ a
tion of justice. Instances of remaining law­ ii
lessness have become of rare occurrence; po­ t4
to litical turmoil and turbulence have disap­ b
peared; useful industries have been resumed; f
public credit in the Southern States has been t
greatly strengthened, and the encouraging c
benefits of a revival of commerce between the
sections of the country lately embroiled in y
. civil war are fully enjoyed. Such are some. v
of the results already obtained, upon It
which the country is to be congratulated.
They are of such importance that we
may wltn connaence pauen.uy aWaI ie
~Lu a
sired consummation that will surely come with o
the natural progress of events. 11
he It may not be improper here to say that it a
is should be our fixed and unalterable determina­ s
tion to protect by all available and proper ii
means under the constitution and the laws, the n
lately emancipated race in the enjoyment of a
their rights and privileges, and I urge upon a
those to whom heretofore the colored people t
have sustained the relation of bondsmen, the d
wisdom and justice of humane and liberal lo­ c
0­ cal legislation with respect to their education a
id and general welfare. A firm adherence to the t
laws, both national and state, as to the civil g
and political rights of the colored people, .1
now advanced to full equal citizenship, z
and the immediate repression and sure punish­ 1;
ment by the national and local authorities e
within their respective jurisdictions of every c
he instance of lawlessness and violence toward t
is them, is required for the security alike of both c
races, and is justly damanded by the public t
opinion of the country and the age. In this I
way the restoration of harmony and good will, c
and the complete protection of every citizen t
in the full enjoyment of every constitutional t
right, will surely be attained. Whatever i
authority rests with me to this end I shall not
0­ hesitate to put forth. Whatever belongs to
s1 the power of Congress and the jurisdiction of E
b­ the Courts of the Union they may confidently I
,r­ be relied upon to provide and perform, and to
the legislatures, the courts and the executive i
authorities of the. several states It earnestly appeal to secure by adequate,. ad
appropriate and reasonable means within IV
their borders these common and uniform si]
rights of a united people which love-liberty, wi
abhor oppression and revere justice. These at
objects are very dear to my heart, and I shall re
continue most earnestly to strive for their at­
tainment. The cordial co-operation of all cc
classes, of all sections of the country, and of bE
both races is required for this purpose, and of
with these blessings assured, and not other­ th
wise, we may safely hope to hand down our Aj
free institution of government unimpaired to 15
ý
the generations that will succeed us. le
FINANOIAL. cc
Among the other subjects of great and 0o
S
general importance to the people of this th
S country, I cannot be mistaken, I think, in re­ cc
garding as pre-eminent the policy and meas­ e3
ures which are designed to secure the restora­ re
tion of the currency to that normal and at
healthful condition in which by the resump­ re
- tion of specie payments our internal trade and of
foreign commerce inay be brought into har­ to
m'ony with the system of exchanges which is d(
devolved upon the precious metal as the in­ te
trinsic money of the world. In the public 'h,
f
judgment, that this end should be sought and w
e compassed as speedily and as securely as the bh
resources of the people and the wisdom of of
the Government can accomplish, there is a a
much, greater degree of unanimity than is le
found to concur in the specific measures cc
r­
which will bring the country to this desired Si
if end, or the rapidity of the steps by which it t1
can be safely reached. Upon a most anxious it:
and deliberate examination, which I have felt vo
d it my duty to give to the subject, I am but the w
more confirmed in the opinion which I ex­
pressed in accepting the nomination for the 1P
d Presidency, and again upon my inauguration,
`
n
that the policy of resumption should be pur­ fa
d sued by every suitable means, and that no cm
d legislation would be wise that should disparage 1!
n the importance or retard the attainment of ci
that result? I have no disposition, and cer­ o0
e tainly no right, to question the sincerity or in­ it
- tegrity of opposing opinions; and would p
neither conceal nor undervalue the consider­
1­ able difficulties and even occasional distresses
a
it which may attend the progress of the nation o1
h toward this primary condition, to its general jr
and permanent prosperity. I must, however, p
adhere to my most earnest conviction, that tc
it
any wavering in purpose or unsteadi-. o:
if ness in methods, so far from avoid­ n
it
ing or reducing the inconveni­
t­
ence inseparable from the transition from U
t an irredeemable to a redeemable paper cur­ i&lt;
h rency, would only tend to increased and pro­ ti
longed disturbance in values, and unless re­ c,
:e
lieved must end in serious disorder, dishonor li
1­
and disaster in the financial affairs of *the gov­ tc
Ii ernment and of the people. The mischiefs it
ic which I apprehended and urgently deprecate, b
are confined to no class of the people, indeed,
n
but seem to me most certainly to threaten the c,
industrious masses, whether their occupations ci
are of skilled or common labor. To them it
a:
seems tO me itis of importance that their labor p
to
should be compensated in money which is in I
i. itself fixed in exchangeable value by being ir­ ri
iy
revocably measured by the labor necessary to ti
t­ its production. The permanent quality of the a
s. money of the people is sought for and can
n only be gained by the resumption of specie t]
a­ payment. The rich, the speculative, the a
s­ money-dealing classes, may not always feel the f,
st mischiefs of, or may find casual profits in a a
ic
variable currency; but the misfortunes of such fi
er
a currency to those who are paid salaries or a
v. wages are remediless. d
it COINAGE. O
a Closely connected with this general subject a
a­
of the resumption of specie payments is one o
ef
of subordinate but still of grave importance, v
t­ I mean the readjustment of our coinage sys­ o
se tem. By the renewal of the silver dollar as an o
3­
element in our specie currency, endowed by ti
n­
legislation with the quality of legal tender to a ii
of
greater or less extent. As there is no doubt of c
the power of Congress under the constitution t]
iy to coin money and regulate the value thereof, a
a­ and as this power covers the whole range of te
ss
authority applicable to the metal, the rated c:
at
value, and the legal tender quality which shall i1
ie
be adopted for the coinage, the considerations ci
ie
which should induce or discourage a particu­ fi
ie lar measure connected withll the coinage be­ d
i­
long clearly to the province of legis­ d
at
lative discretion and of public expe­ ti
is
diency. Without intruding upon this si
y province of legislation in the least, I have yet si
s, thought the subjectof such critical importance I
e in the actual condition of our affairs as to t1
i­
present an occasion for the exercise of the o:
)f
duty hiposed by the Constitution on the Pres­ v
f­
ideAnt. of ImrnlnmeirliTlnr to tllp annarlo r~nf
y of Congress such measures as he shall judge
n necessary and expedient. Holding the opin­ n
*n
ion, as I do, that neither the interests of the ci
)f
Government nor of the people of the United lE
g States would be promoted by disparaging sil­ a
r,
ver as one of the two precious metals which o:
it furnish the coinage of the world, and that g
11
legislation which looks to maintaining the vol­ b
l ume of intrinsic money to as full .
da measure of both metals as their n
st
relative commercial values will permit, a
al
would be neither unjust nor inexpedient, I sj
is must ask your indulgence to a brief and def­ c:
3­
inite statement of certain essential features in d
i­ any such legislative measure which I feel t
v­
it my duty to recommend. I do not propose ti
)­
to enter the debate represented on both sides k
p­
by such able disputants in Congress and be­ b
d;
fore the people and ini the press, as to the ex­ r,
n tent to which the legislation of any one nation n
ig
can control this question. Even within its tj
ie own borders, against the laws of trade or the a
in
positive .laws of other governments, the e:
te.
wisdom of Congress in shaping any particular
a
>n
law that may be presented for my approval t]
d.
may wholly supersede the nr -essity of my en­ e
rc
tering into these considerations, and willingly g
a­
avoid either vague or intricate inquiries. It is sj
bh only certain plain and practical traits of such o
legislation that I desire to recommend to your n
it attention. In any legislation providing for a li
a­
silver coinage, regulating its value and impart­ ih
ar
ing to it the quality of legal tender, it seems to a
ie
me that Congressshould not lose sight of its e:
of
action as operating in a two-fold capacity
in
and two distinct directions. If the United
le States Government were free from a public c
le
debt its legislative dealin'g with the question n
o­ of silver coinage would be purely sovereign e'
m
and governmental, under no restraint but o
ie
those of the constitutional power, the public n
ril
good as affected by the proposed legislation,
g
e, but in the actual circumstances of the nation, e
p,
with a vast public debt distributed very wide­ fi
h­
ly among our own citizens and -held in great ii
es amlounts also abroad, the nature of the silver a
ry coinage measure as affecting this relation of c
rd
the government to the holders of the public
th
debt becomes, in any proposed legislation, of b
Lic
the highest concern. The obligation of the a
Lis
public faith transcends all questions of profit t:
11,
or public advantage otherwise. Its .unques­
an
tionable 'maintenance is the dictate as well as 1,
Lal the highest expediency as of the most
er necessary duty, and will be 'carefully
u
ot guarded by Congress and the people ,
to alike. The public debt of the United j
of States to the amount of .$729,000,000 bears t'
ly interest at the rate of six per cent., and $708,­ '
to 000,000 at the rate of 5 per cent., and the only '
ve
way in which the country can be relieved from (
I the payment of the high rates of interest is by t
advantageously refunding the indebtedness.
Whether the debt is ultimately paid in gold or
silver coin is of but little moment compared
with the possible reduction of interest to the
amount of one third by refunding it at such
reduced rate. If the United States had the ui­
questionable right to pay its bonds in silver
coin the little benefit from that process would
be greatly overbalanced by the injurious effect.
of such payment if made or proposed against
the honest convictions of the public creditors.
All the bonds that have been issued since Feb,
12, 1873, when gold became the only unlimited
legal tender metallic currency of the
country, are justly payable in gold coin
or in coin of equal value. During
the time of these issues the only dollar that
could be or was received by the government in .
exchange for bonds was the gold dollar. To
require the public creditors to take in payment
any dollar of less commercial value would be
regarded by them as a repudiation of the full
obligation assumed. The bonds issued prior
to 1873 were issued at a time when the gold
dollar was the only coin in circulation or con­
templated by either the government or the
,
'holders of the bonds, as the coin in which they'
were to be paid. It is far better to pay these.
bonds in coin than to seem to take advantage
of the unforseen fall of silver bullion, to pay in
a new issue of silver coin that made so much
less valuable the power of the United States'to
coin money and to regulate the value thereof. :
Such a power ought never to be exercised for
the purpose of enabling the government to pay
its obligations in a coin of less
value than that contemplated by the parties
when the bonds were issued. Any attempt'to
pay the national indebtedness in coinage 'of
less commercial value than the money of the.
.
world would involve a violation of the public.
faith and work irreparable injury to the public
credit. It was the great merit of the act of
March, 1869, in strengthening the public
credit that removed all doubt as to the purpose
of the United States to pay their bonded debt
in coin. That act was accepted as a pledge of. .
public faith. The government has derived
great benefit from it in the progress thus far
made in refunding the public debt at lowrate .
of interest. An adherence to the wise and
just policy of, or the exact observance of,. the
public faith will enable the government rapidly
to reduce the burden of 'interest
of the national debt to an amount/
not exceeding $20,000,000 per an­
num and effect an aggregate saving to the
United States of more than $300,000,000 be­
fore the bonds can be fully paid. In adopting
the new silver coinage to the ordinary uses of
currency, in the every day transactions of
life,and preserving the quality of legal tender,
to be assigned to it a consideration of the first
importance, should be so to adjust the rites
between the silver and the gold coinage which
now constitutes our specie currency as to ac­
complish the desired end of maintaining the
circulation of the the two metallic currencies
and keeping up theavolume of the two:
precious metals as our intrinsic' money.
It is a mixed question for scientific
reasoning and historical experience to de-.
termine how far and by what methods
a practicable equilibrium can be maintained'
which will keep both metals in circulation in
their appropriate spheres of common use. A.i
absolute equality of­ commercial value,' free
from disturbing fluctuations, is hardly attain­
able, and without it an unlimited legal-tender
1
for private transactions assigned to both met­
.
als would tend to drive out of circulation the
dearest coinage, and disappoint the principal
object proposed by the legislation in view. I
t
apprehend, therefore, that the two conditions
3
of a near approach to equality of commercial
values between the gold and silver coinage
- of the same denomination, and of a limitation:i
1 of the amounts for which the silver coinage is
f to be a legal tender, are essential to maintain­
ing both in circulation. If these conditions
f
can be successfully observed the issue from
r
the mint of silver dollars would afford material
assistance to the community in the transitioni
f to redeemable paper money, and would fa-.
I cilitate the resumption of specie payment and
1
in permanent establishment. Without these
Sconditions
I fear that only mischief and mis­
fortune would flow from a coinage of silver..;
-
dollars with the quality of unlimited legal ten­ :·
- ders even in private transactions. Any expec­
::
tation of'temporary ease from an issue of
""
Ssilver
coinage to pass as a 'legal tender at .
Sstate
materially above the commercial value is,
3
I am
persuaded, a delusion; noreanIthinkrthat
' there is any substantial distinction betwieen an
3
original issue of silver dollars at a nominal i
- value materially above their commercial value,
and the restoration of the silver dollar at a rate
3 which once was, but has ceased to be, its corn­
-
mercial value. Certainly the issue of our gold:
3 coinage reduced in weight-materially below its
l
legal tender value, would not be any the ,less
a present debasement of the coinage by reason
u
of its equalling or even exceeding in weight a
good coinage which at some past time had
been commercially useful to the, legal tender
.'
1 value assigned to the new issue. In recom­
1' mending that the regulation of any silver coin­
age which may be authorized by Congress
should observe these conditions of commer­
cial value and limited legal ten­
1 der, I
. am governed by the feeling
1
that every possible increase should be given to
3 the volume of metallic money which can be
6 kept in circulation, and thereby ever. possi­
ble aid afforded to the people in the process of
resuming specie payment. It is the excuse of
1 my conviction that a disregard of these condi­
s
tions would frustrate the good results which!.
are desired from the proposed coinage, and
.
embarrass with new elements of confusion
:
and uncertainty the business of the country,
that I urge upon your attention these' consid­
.:';
erations. I respectfully recommend to Con-::.'
gress that in any legislation providing for a
s silver coinage and imparting to it the quality
1 of legal tender, there be impressed in the.
' measure a firm provision exempting the .pub­
1 lic debt, heretofore issued and now outstand-..
ing, from payment either of principal or inter­
est, in any coinage of less value than'the pres !­
ent gold coinage of the country.
cIVIL SERVICE.
1
The organization of the civil service of the
country has for a number of years attracted
more and more of public attention. So gen­
eral has become the opinioni that the methods:
t of admission to it, and the condition of re­
maining in it, are unsound, that both of the
great political parties have agreed on the most.
explicit declarations of the necessity of re­
form, and in the most emphatic demands for .
t it. I have fully considered the declarations:
r and demands to be the expressions of sincere,,i
f convictions of the intelligent masses of the :
c
people upon the subject, and that they should
f be recognized and followed by earnest.
B and prompt action on the part of the legisla:i
t tive and executive departments of the govern:
ment. In.pursuance of the purpose indicated.::.
s before my accession to office, I endeavored' to
have my own views distinctly understood,. andur.i:t
I
Y upon my inauguration my accord with the:i:rs
e .public opinion was stated in terms believed to
be plain and unambiguous. My experience in
5.the executive duties has strongly confirmed
-the belief in the great advantage the country
Y w ould find in observing strictly the planei of: the
a Constitution which imposes upon the' execu­
Y
tive the sole duty and responsibility :of the

selection of those federal officers who by law
are appointed, not elected, and which in like
manner assigns to the Senate the complete
right to advise and consent to or to reject the
nominations so made, whilst the House of
representatives stands as the public censor of
the performance of official duties, with the
'prerogative of investigation and providing
for punishment in all cases of dereliction.
The blemishes and imperfections in the civil
service may, as I think, be traced in most
eases to a practical confusion of the duties as­
signed to the several departments of the gov­
ernment. My purpose in this respect has
been to return to the system established by the
fundamental law, and to. do this with the
heartiest cooperation and most cordial under­
standing with the Senate and House of Repre­
sentatives. The political difficulties in the se­
lection of numerous officers for posts of widely
varying responsibilities and duties are acknowl­
edged to be very great. No system can be ex­
pected to secure absolute freedom from mistakes
and the beginning of any attempted change
of custom is quite likely to be more empar­
rassed in this respect than any subsequent
period. It is here that the constitution seems
to most prove of its claim to be the great
wisdom accorded to it gives the Executive the
assistance of the knowledge and experienc
of the Senate, which, when acting upon nomi­
nations as to which they may be disinterested
and impartial judges, secures as strong a
guarantee of freedom of errors of importance
as is perhaps possible in human affairs. In
addition to this, I recognize the public ad­
vantage of making all nominations as nearly
as possible in person. In the sense of being
free from mere caprice or favor
in these directions, and in those offices
-which special training is of greatly increased
value, I believe such a rule as to the tenure of
office should obtain as may induce men of
proper qualifications to apply themselves in­
distriously to the task of becoming proficients.
Bearing these things in mind, I have endeav­
ored to reduce the number of changes in sub­
ordinate places usually made upon the change
of the general administration, and shall most
heartily co-operate with Congress in the best
systematizing of such methods and rules of
admission to the public service, and ofypromo­
tion within it as may promise to be nmst suc­
cessful, in making thorough competency, effi­
ciency and character the decisive tests in these
matters..
I ask the renewed attention of Congress to
what has already been done by the civil ser­
vice commission appointed in pursuance of act
of Congress by my predecessor to prepare and
revise the civil service rules. In regard to
much of the departmental service, especially
at Washington, it may be difficult to organize
a better system than that which has thus been
provided, and it is now b'eing used to a consid­
erable extent, under my direction. The Com­
mission has still a legal existence, althoughfor
several years no appropriation has been made
for defraying its expenses. Believing that this
commission has rendered valuable service, and
will be a most universal agency in improving
the administration of the civil service,
I respectfully recommend that a
suitable appropriation to be immediately made
to enable it to continue its service. It is my
purpose to transmit to Congress as early as
practicable, a report by the Chairman of the
Commission, and to ask your attention to such
measures upon this4subject as in my opinion
will further promote the improvement of the
civil service.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
' During the past year the United States have con­
tinued to maintain peaceful relations with foreign
powers. The outbreak of war between Russia and
Turkey, though at one time attended by grave ap­
prehensions as to its effect upon other European
nations, has had no tendency to disturb the amica­
ble relations existing between the United States and
each of the contending powers. An attitude of just
and impartial neutrality has been preserved, and I
am gratified to state that in the midst of their hostili­
ties both the Russian and the Turkish Governments 1
have shown an earnest desire to adhere to the obli­ I
gations of all treaties with the United States and
give due regard to the rights of American citizens.
By the terms of the treaty defining the rights, im­
.munities and privileges of consuls between Italy'
and the United States, ratified in 1868, either govern­
ment may after the lapse of ten years terminate the
existence of the treaty by giving twelve months' no­
tice of its intention. The government of Italy, avail­
ing itself of this, has now given the required notice.
The treaty will accordingly end on the 15th of Sep­
tember, 1878. It. is understood, however, that the
Italian government wishes to renew in its general
scope, desiring only certain modifications in some of
its al-ticles. h this disposition I concur, and shall
hope that no serious obstacles may intervene to pre­
vent or delay the negotiaion of a satisfactory treaty.
Numerous questions in regard to passports, natur­
alization and.exemption from military service, have
continued to arise in cases of emigrants from Ger­
many, who have returned to their native country.
The provisions of the treaty of February 22, 1868,
however, have proved to be so ample and so judi­
cious that the legation of the United States at Berlin
bhas been able to adjust all claims arising under it,
not only without detriment to the amicable relations
existing between the two governments, but it is be­
lieved without injury or injustice duly naturalized
American citizen. It is desirable that the treaty
originally made with the North-German Union in
1867 should now be extended so as to apply equally
to all the States of the Empire of Germany.
The institution of the government of France to
participate in the exposition of the products of agri­
culture, industry and the fine arts, to be held at Paris
during the coming year, was submitted for your con­
sideration at the extra session. It is not doubted
that its acceptance by the United States, and a well­
selected exhibition of the products of American in­
dustry on that occasion, will tend to stimulate inter­
national commerce and immnigration, as well as to
promote friendship between the two countriest
A question arose some time since as to the proper
meaning of the extraditing articles of the treaty of
1843 between the United States and Great Britain.
Both governments, however, are now in accord in
the belief that the question is not one that should be
allowed to frustrate the ends of justice or to disturb.
the friendship between the two nations. No serious
difficulty has arisen in accomplishing the extradition
of criminals when necessary. It is probable that the
points of disagreement will in due time be settled,
and if need be. more explicit declarations be made in
a new treaty. The Fishery Commission under arti­
cles 28 and 30, of the Treaty of Washington,
has concluded its session. The result of
the deliberations of the Commission as made public
by the Commissioners, will be communicated to
Congress, A treaty for the protection of trade­
anarks has been negotiated with Great Britain, which
has been submitted to the Senate for consideration.
The revolution which recently occurred in Mexico
was followed by the accession of the successful par­
ty to power and the installation of its chief ganeral,
Poriirio Diaz, in the Presidentialoilce. It has been
the custom of the United States wheni such changes
of government have heretofore occurred in Mexico
to recognize and enter into offilcial relations with the
•defacto government as soon as it should appear
to have the approval of the MIexican people
and should manifest a disposition to adhere to
the obligations of treaties and international
friendship. In the present case such official recog­
nition has been deferred by the occurrences on the
Rio Grande border, the records of which have al­
ready been communicated to each House of Con­
gress in answer to their respective resolutions of in­
qluiry. Assurances have been received that the au­
thorities at the seat of the Mexican government have
both the disposition and the power to prevent and
punish such unlawful invasions and depredations.
It is earnestly to be hoped that events may prove
these assurances to be well founded. The best in­
terests of both countries require the maintenance
of peace upon the border, and the development of
commerce between the two Republics. It is gratify­
ing to add that this temporary interruptioni of oillcial
relations has not prevented duie attention
by the representatives of the United
States in Mexico to the protection of
American citizens so far as practicable; nor has it
interfered with the prompt payment of the amounts
due from Mexico to the United States under the
treaty of July 4, 1868, and the awards of the Joint
Commission. While I do not anticipate an Interrup­
tion of the friendly relations with Mexico. yet I can­
not but look with some solicitude on a continuance
of the brder disorders as exposing the two countries
to initiations of popular feeling and mischances of
-action, which are naturally unfavorable to complete
amity. Firmly determined that nothing shall be
wanting on their part to promote a good understand­
ing between the two nations, I yet must ask the
attention of Congress to the actual occurrences on
-the border, that-the lives and property of our citizens
may be adequately protected and peace preserved.
Another year has passed without bringing 'to a
close the protracted contest between the Spanish
government and tihe insurrection in the island of
Cuba. While the United States have sedulously
abstained from any intervention in this controversy.
it is impossible not to feel that it is attended by in­
cidents affecting the rights of American citizens
apart from the effect of the hostilities upon the trade
between the United States anud Cuba. Their prog­
ress is inevitably accompanied by complaints,
having more or less foundation, of searches, arrests,
embargoes and oppressive taxes upon the property
of American residents and of unprovoked
interference with American vessels and com­
Inerce. It is due to the government of Spain
to say that during the past year it has promptly dis­ avowed and offered reparation for any unauthorized
acts of zealous subordinates whenever Such acts have
been brought to its attention. Nevertheless such oc­
currences cannot but tend to excite feelings of an­
noyance, suspicion and resentment, which are great­
ly tobe deprecated, between the respective subjects
and citizens of two friendly powers.
Much delay consequent on the occasions of fraud
in some of the awards has occurred in respect to the
distribution of the limited amounts received from
Venezuela under the treaty of April 25, 1866,applicable
to the awards of the joint commissioners created by
that treaty. So long as these matters are pending
in Congress the Executive cannot assume either to
pass upon the questions presented or to distribute
the fund received. It is eminently desirable that
definite legislative action should be taken either de­
ciding the awards to be final or providing some
method for examination of the claims. Our relations
with the Republics of Central and South America
and with the Empire of Brazil have continued with­
out serious change further than the temporary inter­
ruption of diplomatic intercourse with Venezuela and
with Guatemala. Amicable relations have already
been fully restored with Venezuela, and it is not
doubted that all grounds of misundersttznding with
Guatemala will speedily be removed. From all these
countries there are favorable indications of a dis­
position on the part of their governments and people
to reciprocate our efforts in the direction of increased
commercial intercourse.
The government of the Samoan Islands has sent
an envoy in the person of its Secretary of State to
invite the government of the United States to advise
and protect their independence, to establish com­
mercial relations with their people and to assist them
in their steps towards responsible and regular gov­
ernment. The inhabitants of these Islands having
made considerable progress in Christian civilization'
and in the development of trade are doubtful of their
ability to maintain peace and independence without
the aid of some stronger power. The subject is
deemed worthy of respectful attention and the
claims upon our assistance by this independent conm­
munity will be carefully considered.
BUSINESS DEPRESSION.
The long commercial depression in the United
States has directed attention to the subject of the
possible increase of our foreign trade and the meth­
ods for its development, not only with Europe but
with other countries, and especially with the states
and sovereignties of the Western Hemisphere. In­
structions from the Department of State were is­
sued to the various diplomatic and consular olfices
of the Government, asking them to devote attention
to the question of methods by which trade between
the respective countries of their official residences
and the United States could be most judiciously
founded. In obedience to the instructions, ex­
aminations and reports upon this subject have been
made by many of these officers and transmitted to
thb Department, and the same are submitted to the
cohsideration of Congress.
FINANCIAL.
The annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury
presents important questions for the action of Con­
gress, upon some of which I have already remarked.
The revenues of the government during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1877, were $269,000,5b6.6'2. The
total expenditures for the same period were $23S,­
660,00S.93, leaving a surplus revenue of $30,340,577.69.
This has substantially supplied the requirements of
the sinking fund for that year. The estimated reve­
nues of the current fiscal year are $2i5,500,000, and
the estimated expenditures for the same period are
$232,430,643.72. If these estimates prove to be
correct there will be a surplus revenue of $33,­
069,856.28, an amount nearly sufficient for
the sinking fund for that year. The
estimated revenues for the next fiscal year are
$269,250,000. It appears from the report that during
the last fiscal year the revenues of the government
compared with the previous year, have largely de­
creased. This decrease, amounting to the sunm of
$18,481,452.54, was mainly in customs duties caused
partly by a large falling off of the amount of im­
ported dutiable goods and partly by the general fall
of prices in the markets of the productions of such
articles as pay ad valorem taxes. While this is felt
injurious it has been accompanied with a
very large increase of exportations. Tne total
'exports during the last fiscal year, including coin,
has been $658,637,457 and the imports have been $192,­
097,540, leaving a balance of trade in favor of the
United, States amounting to the sum of $166,539,917,
the beneficial effects of which extend to all branches
of business. The estimated revenue for the next
fiscal year will impose upon Congress the duty of
strictly limiting the appropriations, including the
requisite sum for the maintenance of the sinking
fund, within the aggregate estimate of receipts.
While the aggregate of taxes should not be increased
amendments might be made to the revenue laws
that would without diminishing the revenue
relieve the people from unnecessary burdens.
A tax on tea and coffee is shown by the experience
not only of our own country but of other countries
to ibe easily collected without loss by undervaluation
or fraud and largely borne in the country of produc­
tion. A tax of 10 cents per pound on tea and two
cents per pound on colffee would produce a revenue
exceeding $12,000,000, and thus enable Congress to
repeal a multitude of annoying taxes yielding a rev­
enue not exceed!ng that sum. The internal revenue
system grew out of the necessities of the war, and
most of the legislation imposing taxes upon domes­
tic products under this system has been repealed.
By the substitution of a tax on tea and coffee all
forms of internal taxation may be repealed, except
that on whisky, spirits, tobacco and beer.
REVENUE LAWS.
Attention is also called to the necessity of enacting
more vigorous laws for the protection of the revenue
and for the punishment of frauds and smuggling.
This can be best done by judicious provisions that
will induce the disclosure of attempted fraud by un­
dervaluation and smuggling. All revenue laws
should be simple in their provisions and easily un­
derstood. So far as practicable the rates of taxation
should be in the form of specific duties and not ad­
valorem, requiring the judgment of experienced
men to ascertain values and exposing the revenue to
the temptation of fraud. IMy attention has been
called during the recess of Congress to the abuses
in connection with the customs, and strenuous efforts
have been made for their correction by executive
orders. The recommendations submitted to the Sec­
retary of the Treasury by a commission appointed to
examine into the collection of customs duties at the
port of New York contain many suggestions for the
mnodification of the customs laws to which the atten­
tion of Congress is invited.
It is a matter of congratulation that notwiths tand­
ing the severe burdens caused by the war the public
faith with all creditors has been preserved, and as
the result of this policy the public credif has contin­
uously advanced and our public securities are re­
garded with the highest favor in the markets of the
world. I trust that no act of the government will
cast a shadow upon its credit. The progress of re­
funding the public debt has been rapid and satisfac­
tory.
SUBSCRIPTION TO BONDS.
Under the contract existing when I entered upon
the discharge of the duties of my office the bonds
bearing interest at the rate of 4;! per cent. were be­
ing rapidly sold and within three months the aggre­
gate sales of these bonds had reached the sum of
$2L0,000,000. With my sanction the Secretary of the
Treasury entered into a new contract for the sale of
4 per cent bonds, and within 30 days after the popu­
lar subscription for such bonds was opened. sub­
scriptions Were had amounting to $75,496,550, which
were paid for within 90 days after the date of the
subscription. By this process within but little more
than one year the annual interest on the public debt
was reduced in the sum of $3,775,000.
SAVINGS.
I recommend that suitable provision be made to
enable the people to easily convert their savings into
government securities, as the best mode in which
small savings may be well secured and yield a mod­
erate interest. It is an object of public policy to re­
tain among our own people the securities of the
United States. In this way our country is guarded
against their sudden return from foreign countries,
caused by war or other disturbance beyond our con­
trol.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE.
The commerce of the United States with foreign
nations and especially in the export of domestic
productions, has of late years largely increased, but
the greater portion of this trade is conducted
in foreign vessels. The importance of
enlarging our foreign trade and especially by di­
rect and speedy interchange with the countries on
this continent, cannot be overestimated, and it is a
matter of great moment that our shipping interest
should receive, to the utmost practical extent, the
bonefit of our commerce with other lands. These
considerations are forcibly urged by all the large
commercial cities of the country, and public atten­
tion is generally and wisely attracted to the solution
of the problems they present. It is not doubted that
Congress will take them up in the broadest spirit of
liberality and respond to the public demand by prac­
ticable legislation upon this subject.
THE ARMIY.
The report of the Secretary of War shows that the
army has been actively employed during the
year, and has rendered very important service in
repressing hostilities in the Indian country, and
preserving peace and, proteeting life and property in
the interior, as well as along the Mlexican border.
A long and arduous campaign has been prosecuted
with tinal complete success against a portion of the
NezPerces tribe of Indians. A full account of this
campaign will be found in the report of the General
of the Army. It will be seen that in its course several
battles were fought, in which a number of gallant
oillcers and men lost their lives. I join with the Sec­
retary of War and the General of the Army in
awarding to the ofillcers and umen employed in the
long and toilsome pursuit, and in the final
capture of these Indians, the honor and praise which
is so justly their due.
TRADE TROUBLES.
The very serious riots which occurred in several
of the states in July last rendered necessary the em­
ployment of a considerable portion of the army to
preserve peace and maintain order in the states of
West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Illinois.
These disturbances were so formidable as to defy
the local and state authorities, and the National exe­
cutive.was called upon in the mode provided by the
Constitution and laws to furnish military, and I am
grateful to he able to state that the troops sent in re­
sponse to these calls for aid in suppression of domes­
tic violence, were able by the influence of their pres­
ence in the disturbed regions to preserve the peace
and restore order without the use of force. In the
discharge of this delicate and important duty both
officers and men acted with great prudence and
courage, and for their services deserve the thanks
of their country.
THE MEXICAN TROUBLES.
Disturbances along the Rio Grande in Texas, to
which I have already referred, have rendered neces­
sary the coustant employment of a military force in
that vicinity. A full report of all recent military operations in that quarter has been transmitted to I1
the House of Representatives in answer to a resolu­ fi
tion of that body, and it will not therefore be neces­ fi
sary to enter into details. I regret to say that these tl
lawless incursions into our territory by armed bands s1
from the Mexican side of the line, for the purpose of p
robbery, have been of frequent occurrence, and in c
spite of the most vigorous efforts of the commander d
of our forces, the marauders have generally suc­
ceeded in escaping into Mexico with their plunder.
In May last I gave orders for the exercise of .the ut­ si
most vigilance on the part of our troops c
for the suppression of these raids and the d
punishment of the guilty parties, as well as the re­ n
capture of property stolen by:them. Gen. Ord, com­ d
manding in Texas. was directed to invite the cooper­ o
ation of the Mexican authorities in efforts to this t1
end, and assure ithem that I was anxious to avoid ti
giving the least offense to Mexico; at the sameltime ii
he was directed to give notice of my determination
to put an end to the invasion of our territory by law­
less bands, intent on the plunder of our peaceful c
citizens, even if the effectual punishment of the out­ o
laws should make the crossing of the border by our ti
troops in their pursuit necessary. It is believed that X
this policy has had the effect to check somewhat ti
these depredations, and that with a considerable in­ h
crease of our force upon that frontier, and the estab­ t
lishment of several additional military posts along v
the Rio Grande, so as more effectually to guard that '1
extensive border, peace may be preserved and the t
lives and property of citizens in Texas be fully pro­ b
tected. ti
THE ARMY. p
Prior to the first day of July last the army was, in a
acdordance with law, reduced to the maximum of e
25,000 enlisted men, being a reduction of 2500 below o
the force previously authorized. This reduction was ii
made as required by law, entirely from the infantry c
and artillery branches of the service, without any re­ v
duction of the cavalry. Under the law as it now a
stands, it is necessary that the Cavalry regiments be r
recruited to 100 men in each company for service on n
the Mexican and Indian frontiers. The necessary o
effect of this legislation is to reduce the infantry and n
artillery arms of the service below the number re­
quired for efficiency, and I concur with the Secre­
tary of War in recommending that authority be given o
to recruit all companies of infantry to at least lifty ii
men, and all batteries of artillery to at least seventy­ i
five men, with power in case of emergency to in­ p
crease the former to 100 and the latter to 125 men a
each. .
I invite your special attention to the following rec­ v
dmmendations of the Secretary of War: First, that t
provision be made for supplying to the army a more
abundant and better supply of leading matter.
Second, that early action be taken by Congress look­ t
ing to a complete revision and republication of the t:
army regulations. Third, that section 1258, of the o
Revised Statutes limiting the number of oflicers on t
the retired list be repealed. Fourth, that the claims a
arising under act of July 4, 1864, for supplies, taken h
by the army during the war, be taken from the offices t
of the Quartermaster and Commissary Generals, and v
transferred to the Southern Claims Commission, or i
some other tribunal having more time and better fa­ i
cilities for their prompt investigation and decision d
than are possessed by these olllcers. Fifth, that Con­ t

THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows i
that we have six squadrons now engaged in the pro­ o
tection of our foreign commerce and other duties t,
pertaining to the naval service. The condition and e
operations of the department are also shown. The C
total expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, ih
1877, were $16,0T7,974.54. There are unpaid claims n
against the department chargeable to the last year lI
which are presented to the consisderation of Con-. i
gress. By the report of the Secretary the estimates I
for the liscal year commencing July 1, 1878, are o
16,233,234.40, exclusive of the sum of 231,443.11 sub­ e
mitted for new building, repairs and improvements f1
at tile several navy yards. The appropriations for p
present fiscal year commencing July, 1577, are n
$13,592,932.90. The amount drawn from the treasury e
from July 1 to November 1, 1877, is $3,343,037.40, of d
which there is estimated to be yet available $1,029,­ o
523 30, showing the amount of actual expenditure it
during the first four months of the present liscal year i
to have been $4,313,509.10. b
THE 1'OSTOFFICE DEPART3IENT. t
The report of the Postmaster General contains a a
full and clear statement of the operations and con­ t;
dition of the Postollice Department. The ordinary it
revenues of the department for the fiscal year end­ C
ing June 30, 1577, including receipts from the money o
order business and from olticial stamps and stamped "",
envelopes amounted to to the sum of $27,531,085.26. The
\
additional sum of $7,013,000 was received from ap­ c
propriation from the general treasury for various 1
purposes, making the receipts from all sources $34,­ 13
5-i4,685.26. The total expenditures during the liscal 1:
year amounted to $33,486,322,41, leaving an excess of i,
total receipts over total expenditures of $1,05S,56.82, ti
and an excess of total expenditures over ordinary I.
receipts of $5,954,737.18. Deducting from the total t,
receipts the sum of $632,618.41 received from inter­ o
national money orders of the preceding fiscal year, ti
and deducting from tile total expenditures the sum ti
of $1,163.818.20 paid on liabilities incurred in previous tl
fiscal years, the expenditures and receipts apper­ a
taining to the business of the last liscal year were as i.

The ordinlary revenue of the Postoffice Department I
for the year ending Juhe 30, 1879. are estimated at an si
increase of three per cent over those of 1877, making tl
$29,034,098.28, and the expenditures for the same t1
year are estimated at $36,427,771, leaving an estimated ,
deliciency for 1179 of $7,393,392.02. The addlitional p
legislation recommended by the Postmaster General f,
for improvements of the mail service and to protect
the postal revenue from the abuses practicedl under a
existing laws is respectfully commended to the care­ c
ful consideration of Congress. h
DEPAIRTMENT OF JUSTICE. n
The report of the Attorney General contains sev­ e
eral suggestions as to the administration of justice tl
to whica I invite attention. The pressure of busi­ t
ness in the Supreme Court and mn certain circuit e
courts of the United States is now such that serious g
delays to the great injury anti even oppression of suit­ (
ors occur, and a remedy should bie sought for. This o
condition of alf'irs, whether it will be found in the s
nhltn r'iiflv nl(tcllpd in ;lie l'lrenrt. of inr:l'nngino the
number of jutges of Circuit Courts, and by means p
of this addition to the judicial force of creating an
intermediate Court of Errors and Appeals, or s
whether some other mode can be devised for obviat­
ing the difficulties which now exist, I leave to your tl
mature consideration.
TIIE INDIANS.
The present condition of the Indian tribes on the
Territory of the United States, and our relations with g
them, are fully set forth In the reports of the Secre­
tary of the Interior and the Comniissioner of Indian i
Affairs. After a series of the most deplorable con­
flicts, the successful termination of which while re­
electing honor on the brave soldiers who accom­ t
plished it, cannot lessen our regret at the occurrence. e
We are now at peace with all the Indian tribes in our 1
borders. To preserve that peace by a just and lhu­ o
mane policy will be the object of my earnest endeav­ t
ors. Whatever may be said of their character and ,
savage propensity, of the difficulties of introducing r
among them the habits of civilized life, and the ob­ t
stacles they have offered to the progress of settling t
in certain parts the country, the Indl­ s
ans are certainly entitled to our sympathy B
and to a conscientious respect on our part for their e
claims upon our sense of justice. They were the ,
aboriginal occupants of the land we now possess; c
they have been driven from place to place; the pur­ c
chase money paid to them in some cases for what c
they called their own has still left them poor; in f
many instances when they had settled down upon
land assigned to them by compact, and begun to sup­
port themselves by their own labor, they were rudely
jostled off and thrust into the wilderness again.
Many, if not most all, our Indian wars have had i
their origin in broken promises and acts of injustice
on our part, and the advance of Indians in civiliza­
tion has been slow because the treatment they re­
ceived did not permit it to be faster and more gen­
eral. We cannot expect them to improve and
follow our guidance unless we keep faith with
them in respecting the rights they possess; and un­
less, instead of depriving them of their opportunities,
we lend them a helping hand. I cordially approve
the policy regarding the management of Indian af­
fairs outlined in the reports of the Secretary of the
Interior, and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
The faithful performance of our promises is the first
condition of a good understanding with the Indians.
I cannot too urgently recommend to Congress that
prompt and liberal provision be made for the con­
scientious fulfillment of all agreements entered into
by the government with Indian tribes. To withhold
the means necessary for the performance of a
promise is always false economy, and is apt to prove
disastrous in its consequences. Especial care is
recommended to provide for Indians settled on their
reservation, such as by furnishing cattle and
agricultural implements to aid them in whatever ef­
forts they may make to support themselves, and
by the reestablishment and maintenance of schools
to bring them under the control of civilized intlu­
ences. I see no reason why Indians who can give
satisfactory proof of having by their own labor sup­
ported their families for a number of years, and who
are willing to detach themselves from their tribal re­
lations, should not be admitted to the benefits of the
homestead act, and the privileges of citizenship, and
I recommend the passage of a law to that effect. It
will be an act of justice as welias a measure of en­
couragement. Earnest efforts ame being made to pu­
rify the Indian Service so that every dollar appro­
priated by Congress shall redound to the benefit of
the Indian. The efforts will have my firm support.
With an improved service and every possible en­
couragement held out to the Indians to better their
condition and to elevate them in the scale of civiliza­
tion we may hope to do at the same time a good work
for them and for ourselves.
PRESERVING UIILIC TIMBER.
I invite the attention of Congress to the import­
ance of the statements and suggestions by the Sec­
retary of the Interior concerning the depredations
committed upon the timber lands of the United
States and the necessity for the preservation of for­
ests. It is believed that the measures taken in pur­
suance of the existing law to arrest these depreda­
tions will be entirely successful if Congress by an ap­
propriation for that purpose renders their continued
enforcement possible. The experience of other na­
tions teaches us that a countrj­ cannot be stripped of
its forests with impunity, and we shall expose our­
selves to the gravest consequences unless the waste­
ful and improvident manner which the forests in the
United States are destroyed be effectually checked.
I earnestly recommend that the measures
suggested by the Secretary of the Interior for the
suppression of depredations on the public timber lauds of the United States for the selling of timber F
from the public lands, and for the preservation of F
forests, be embodied in law, and that, considering F
the urgent necessity of enabling the people of certain F
states and territories to purchase timber from the
public lands in a legal manner, which at present they
cannot do, such a law be passed without unavoidable F
delay.
BARREN LAND.
I would also call the attention of Congress to a F
statement made by the Secretary of the Interior con­
cerning the disposition that might be made of the
desert lands not irrigatable, west of the one hundreth I
meridian. These lands are practically unsalable un­
der the existing laws, and the suggestion is worthy
of consideration, that a system of lease would make
them a source of profit to the United States, while at
the same time legalizing the business of cattle-rais­
ing, which is at present carried on upon them. '
THE HARVEST. '
The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture
contains the gratifying announcement of the extra­ 'I
ordinary success which has rewarded the agricul­
tural industry of the country for the past year. 'I
With the fair prices which obtain for the products of
the soil, especially for the surplus which our people
have to export, we may confidently turn to this as
the most important of all our resources for the re­
vival of the depressed industries of the country. S
The report shows our agricultural progress during $
the year and contains a statement of the work done
by this department for the advancement of agricul­ c
tural industry, upon which the prosperity of our r
people ,o largely depends. Matters of information h
are included of great interest to all who seek by the s
experience of others to improve their own methods $
of cultivation. The effoits of the (lepartment a
increase the production of important arti­ a
cles of consumption, and it is hoped n
will improve the demand for labor and a
advance the business of the country and eventually r
result in saving some of the many millions that are y
now annually paid to foreign nations for sugar and
other staple products which habitual use has made t
necessary in our every-day life. r
CENTENNIAL REPORT.
The Board in behalf of the Executive Departments a
on the International Exposition of 1876 has concluded c1
its labors. The final report of the Board was trans­ a
mitted to Congress by the last session. As these pa­ r
pers contain interesting and valuable information,
and will constitute the only report emanating from t
the government on the subject of 'the exhibition, I r
will invite attention to the matter and recommend r
that the report bhe published for general information. d
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. a
Congress is empowered by the Constitution with c
the authority of exclusive legislation over the Dis­ ii
trictof Columbia in which the seat of government 11
of the nation is located. The interests of the Dis­
trict, having no direct representation in Congress, t
are entitled to especial consideration and care at the c
hands of the general government. The Capital of r
the United States belongs to the nation, and it is c
natural that the American people should take pride
in the seat of their national government and desire
it to be an ornament to the country. Much has been a
done to render it healthful, convenient and attrac­ -
tive,.but much remains to be clone, which its per­
manent inhabitants are not able and ought not to be
expectedto do. To impose upon them the outlay
required for public improvements, which are in a
great measure planned and executed for the conven­
ience of the government and of the many thousands
of visitors from all parts of tile country, who
temporarily reside in the Capital of the nation, is an
edvient injustice. Special attention is asked by the
Commissioners of the District, in their report, which
is herewith transmitted, to the importance of a per­ F
manent adjustment by Congress of the linancial re­
lations between the United States and the District,
involving the regular annual contribution lby the
United States of its just proportion of the expenses
of the District government, of the outlay of all need­
ed public improvements and such measure of relief F
from the burden of taxation now resting on the
people of the District as in the wisdom of Congress F
may be deemed just. The report of the Commission­
ers shows that the affairs of tie District are in a con­ F
dition as satisfactory as could he expected, in view
of the heavy debt resting thereupon and its verylim­ F
ited means for the necessary expensesthe debtof the
District is as follows: Funded debt SS,357-,691.96; 3.85 F
bonds guaranteed by the United States, $13,743,2530;
total bonded debt, $22,122,941.96; to which should be F
added certain outstanding claims as explained in
the report of the Commissioners-$11S,220,452, mak­
ing the total debt of the District, 523,310,146.4S. The
Connnissioners also ask attention to the importance
of the improvement of the Potomac River and the
reclamation of the marshes bordering on the City of e
Washington, and their views upon this subject are
concurred in by the members of the Board of
Health, whose report is also herewith transmitted.
BOJth the commercial and sanitary interests of the
District will be greatly promoted, I doubt not, by this
improvement. Your attention is invited to the sugges­
tion of the Commissioners and of the Board of
Health, for the organization of a Board of Charities
to have supervision and control of the disbursement
of all moneys for charitable purposes fronm tile Dis­
trict treasury. I desire also to ask your especial at­
tention to the need of adding to the efficiency of
the public schools of the District by a supplemental F
appropriation, aid from tihe national treasury. This
is especially just since so large a number of those
attending schools are children of employes of the
Government. I earnestly commend to your care
the interests of the people of the District who are so
intimately associated with the government estab­
lishments, and to whose enterprise the good order
and attractiveness of the Capital are largely due,and
I ask your attention to the request of the Commis­
sioners for legislation in behalf of the interests en­
trusted to their care. The appropriations asked for
the care of reservations belonging to the government F
within their charge by the Commissioners of Public
Buildings and Grounds are also commendled to your
favorable consideration.
The report of the Joint Commission created biy the
act approved August 2, 1176, an act providing for the -
completion of the Washiugton monument, is also
herewith transmitted, with accompanying docu­ tl
ments. The board of engineer ofllcers detailed to tl
examine the monumnent, in compliance with ri
the second section of the act, have reported 5
that the foundation is insullclent. No authority n
exists for making the expenditure necessary to ti
secure its stability. I therefore recommend that the 8
Commission be authorized to expenld such portion 4
of the sum appropriated by the act as may be neces­
sary for the purpose. The present unfinished condi­
LtUlu 01 IIU IIUIUIt.11, UKguu so iou101g ago, is a re­ i
proach to the nation. It cannot be doubted that the F
patriotic sense of the country will mainly respond to F
such prompt provision as may be made for its com­ F
pletion at an early day, and I urge upon Congress F
the propriety and necessity of immediate legislation
for this purpose. F
EDUCATIONAL.
The wisdom of legislation upon the part of Con­ F
gress in aid of the States for education of the whole F
people in those branches of study which are taught
in the common schools of the country is no longer a F
question. The intelligent judgment of the country
goes still further regarding it, as also both constitu­ F
tional and expedient for the general government to I
extend to technical and higher education such aid as F
is deemed essential to the general welfare, and to
our due prominence among the enlightened and cul­
tivated nations of the world. The ultimate settle­
ment of all questions of the future, whether of ad­ r
ministration or finance, or of true nationality of sel­ a
timent, depends upon the virtue and intelligence of I
the people. It is vain to hope for the I
success of a free government without the J
means of insuring the intelligence I
of those who are the source of power. No less than i
one seventh of the entire voting population of our 1
country are yet unable to read and write. It is en­ I
couraging to observe in connection with the growth I
of fraternal feeling in those States in which slavery I
formerly existed evidences of increasing interest in
uinive'sal education, and I shall be glad to give my
approval to any appropriate measures which may be
enacted by Congress for the purpose of supplement­
ing with national aid the local systems of education
in these States, and in all the States. Having already I
invited your attention to the needs of the District of 3
Columbia with respect to its public school I
system, I here add that I believe it de­
sirable, not so much with reference to the
local wants of the District, but the great and lasting
benefit of the entire country, that this system should
be crowned with a university in all respects in keep­
ing with the national capital, and thereby realize the
cherished hopes of Washington on this subject. I
also earnestly commend the request of the Regents
of the Smithsonian Institute that an adequate appro­
priation be made for the conduct of a national m0u­
seum under their supervision. r
The subject of providing for preservation and a
growth of the library of Congress is also one of na­ '
tional importance. As the depositary of copyright ]
publications and records, this library has out-grown J
the provisions for its accommodation, and the erec­ 3
tion on such site as the judgment of Congress may I
approve, of a fire-proof library building to preserve I
the treasures and enlarge the usefulness of this val­ I
uable collection, is recommended.
I recommend, also, such legislation as will render
available and efficient for the purpose of instruction,
so far as consistent with the public service, the
cabinets or museums of invention, of surgery, of
education and of agriculture and other collections, I
the property of the National Government.
The capital of the nation should be something f
more than amere political center. We should avail t
ourselves of all the opportunity which providence t
has placed at our command to commit the general
intelligence of the people and increase the conditions c
most favorable to the success and perpetuity of its c
institutions. (Signed) R. B. HAYESS.

such hearing, a discharge shall not be decreed to
him, the bankrupt may demand a trial by jury
upon a proper issue to be directed by the court, at
such time and place and in such manner as the
court may order; or he may appeal from that de
cision, at any time within ten days thereafter, to
the circuit court next to be held for the same dis­
trict, by simply entering in the district court,
or with the clerk thereof, upon record, his prayer
lor an appeal. 1 ne appeal shall be tried at the
first term of the circuit court after it be taken, un­
less, for sufficient reason, a continuance be grant­
ed ; and it may be heard and determined by said
court summarily, or by a jury, at the option of a
bankrupt ; and the creditors may appear and ob­
ject against a decree of discharge and the allow­
ance of the certificate, as hereinbefore provided.
And if, upon a full hearing of the parties, it shall
appear to the satisfaction of the court, or the jury
shall find, that the bankrupt has made a full dis­
closure and surrender of all his estate, as by this
act required, and has in all things conformed to
the directions thereof, the court shall make a de­
cree of discharge and grant a certificate, as pro­
vided in this act.
Sec. 5. And be it further enacted, That all
creditors coming in and proving their debts under
such bankruptcy, in the manner hereinafter pre­
scribed, the same being- bona fide debts, shall be
entitled to share in the bankrupt's property and ef­
fects, pro rata, without any priority or preference
whatsoever, except only for debts due by such
bankrupt to the United States, and for all debts
due by him to persons who, by the laws of the U.
States, have a preference, in consequence of hav­
ing paid moneys as his sureties, which shall be
first paid out of the assets ; and any person who
shall have performed any labor as an operative in
the service of any bankrupt shall be entitled to re­
ceive the full amount of the wages due to him for
such labor, not exceeding twenty-five dollars:

Provided, That such labor shall have been per­
formed within six months next before the bank­
ruptcy of his employer ; and all creditors whose
debts are not due and payable until a future day,
all annuitants', holders of bottomry and responden­
tia bonds, holders of polices of insurances, sure­
ties, endorsers, bail, or other persons, having un­
certain or contingent demands against such bank­
rupt, shall be permitted to come in and prove such
debts or claims under this act, and shall have a
right, when their debts and claims become absolute,
to have the same allowed them; and such annuitants
and holders of debts payable in future may have

rection of such court, and allowed them according­

ArticloV.-Whereas Chinese subjects in remote and unsettled regions in the United States have been victims of injury in their persons and property at the hands of wicked and lawless men, which unexpected éventa the Chinese Govern-ment regrets, and for which it has olairaed an indemnity, the legal obligation of which the Government of the United States denies ; and, whereas, the Government of the United States, humanely consider-ing these injuries, and bearing in mind the firm and ancient friendship between the United States and China which the high contracting parties wish to cement, is ?desirous of alleviating the exceptional and 'deplorable suffering and losses to which 'the aforesaid Chinese have been subjected ; therefore, the United States, without re-ference to the question of liability, there-fore (which, as a legal allegation, it denies) agrees to pay, on or before the 1st day of March, 1889, the sum of 276,619 75dol.

This government will not cease to urge upon that of Great Britain, full and ample remuneration for all losses, whether arising from detention or otherwise, to which American citizens have heretofore been, or may hereafter be subjected, by the exercise of rights which this government cannot recognise as legitimate and proper. Nor will I indulge a doubt but that the sense of justice of Great Britain will constrain her to make retribution for any wrong, or loss, which any American citizen, engaged in the prosecution of lawful commerce, may have experienced at the hand of her cruisers, or other public authorities. This government, at the same time, will relax no effort to prevent its citizens, if there be any so disposed, from prosecuting a traffic so revolting to the feelings of humanity. It seeks to do no more than to protect the fair and honest trader, from  and injury; but while the enterprising , engaged in the pursuit of an honorable trade, is entitled to its protection, it will visit with condign , others of an opposite character.
                 [The slave trade.] I invite your attention to existing laws for the suppression of the African slave trade, and recommend all such alterations, as may give to them greater force and . That the American flag is grossly abused by the abandoned and profligate of other nations, is but too probable. Congress has, not long since, had this subject under its consideration, and its importance well justifies renewed and anxious attention.
                 [Rice duties.] I also communicate herewith the copy of a correspondence between Mr. Stevenson and Lord Palmerston, upon the subject so interesting to several of the southern states, of the rice duties, which resulted honorably to the *justice of Great Britain, and advantageously to the  States.
                 ['The northeast .] At the opening of the last annual session, the president informed congress of the progress which had then been made in nego-
                 tiating a convention between this government and that of England, with a view to the final settlement of the question of the boundary between the territo. rial limits of the two countries. I regret to say, that little farther advancement of the object has been accomplished since last year; but this is  . stances no way indicative of any abatement of the desire of both parties to hasten the negotiation to its conclusion, and to settle the question in dispute, as early as possible. In the course of the session, it is my hope to be able to announce some further degree of progress, towards the accomplishment of this highly desirable end.
                 The commission appointed by this government for the exploration and survey of the line of boundary separating the states of Maine and New Hampshire from the conterminous British provinces is, it is believed, about to close its field labors, and is expected soon to report the results of its examinations to the department of state. The report, when received, will be laid before congress.
                 [RELATIONS WVITH SPAIN.]
                 The failure on the part of Spain to pay, with punctuality, the interest due under the convention of 1834, for the settlement of claims between the two countries, has made it the duty of the executive to, call the particular attention of that government to the subject. A disposition has been manifested by it, which is believed to be entirely sincere, to fulfil its obligations, in this respect, so soon as its internal condition and the state of its finances will permit. An arrangement is in progress, from the result of which, it is trusted that those of our citizens who have claims under the convention, will, at no distant day, receive the stipulated payments.
                 [TREATY WITH BELGIUM.]
                 A treaty of commerce and navigation with Belgium was concluded and signed at Washington on the 29th March, 1840, and was duly sanctioned by the senate of the United States. The treaty was ratified by his Belgian majesty, but did not receive the approbation of the Belgian chambers within the time limited by its terms, and has, therefore, become void.
                 This occurrence  the graver aspect from the consideration that, in 1833, a treaty negotiated between the two governments, and ratified on the part of the United States, failed to be ratified on the part of Belgium. Trlhe representative of that government, at Washington, informs the department of state that he has been instructed to give explanations of the causes which occasioned delay in the approval of the late treaty by the legislature, and to express the regret of the king at the occurrence.
                 [RELATIONS WITI-I TEXAS.]
                 The joint commission under the convention with Texas, to ascertain the true boundary between the two countries, has concluded its labors; but the final report of the commissioner of the United States has not been received. It is understood, however, that the meridian linc, as traced by the commission, lies somewhat further cast than the position hitherto generally (l to it, and, consequently, includes in Texas some part of the territory which had been considered as belonging to the states of Louisiana md Arkansas.
                 The United States cannot but take a deep interest in whatever relates to this young, but growing republic. Settled principally by emigrants from the United States, we have the happiness to know, that the great principles of civil liberty are there destin-d to flourish, under wise institutions aed wholesome laws; and that,  its example, another evidence is to be afforded of the capacity of popular , to advance the prosperity, happiness, and permanent glory of the human race. 'he great truth, Lhat government was made for the people, and not 'he people for government, has already been  in the practice annd by the example of these United States; and wve can do no other than contem)late its further exemplification by a sister republic, with the  interest.
                 [SOUTr AMERICAN .]
                 Our relations with the independent states of this emisphere, formerly under the dominion of Spain,  not undergone any material change within the )ast year. The incessant sanguinary conflicts in, or )etween those countries, are to be greatly deplored, is necessarily tending to disable them from  their duties as members of the community of , and rising to the destiny which the position and  resources of many of them might lead them  to anticipate, as constantly giving occasion, LISo, directly or indirectly, for complaints on the )art of our citizens who resort thither for purposes
                 if commercial intercourse, and as retarding  for wrongs  , some of which ,re by no means of recent dale.
                 The failure of the congress of Ecuador to hold a ession, at the time appointed for that purpose, in anuary last, will probably render abortive a treaty
                 of commerce with that republic, which was signed at Quito on the 13th of June, 1839, and had. been duly ratified on our part, but which required the approbation of that body, prior to its ratification by the Vcuadorian executive.
                 A convention which has been concluded with the republic of Peru, providing for the settlement of certain claims of citizens 0f the United States, upon the government of that republic, will be duly  to the senate.
                 The claims of our citizens against the Brazilian , originating from captures, and other causes, are still unsatisfied. The United States have, however, so uniformity shown a disposition to cultivate relations of amity with that empire, that it is hoped, the unequivocal tokens of the same spirit towards us, which an adjustment of the affairs referred to would afford, will be given without further avoidable delay.
                 [FLoRIDA WAR.]
                 The war with the Indian tribes on the peninsula of Florida has, during the last summer and fall, been prosecuted with untiring activity and zeal. A  campaign was resolved upon, as the best mode of bringing it to a close. Our brave officers and  who have been engaged in that service, have suffered toils and privations, and exhibited an energy, which, in any other war, would have won for them unfading laurels. In despite of the sickness incident to the climate, they have penetrated the fastnesses of the Indians, broken up their encampments, and harassed them unceasingly. Numbers havebeen captured, and still greater numbers have surrendered, and have been transported to join their brethren on the lands elsewhere allotted to them by the government, and a strong hope is entertained that, under the conduct of the gallant officer at the head of the troops in Florida, that troublesome and expensive war is destined to a speedy termination. With all the other Indian tribes, we are enjoying the blessings of peace. Our duty, as well as our best interests, prompt us to observe, in all our intercourse with them, fidelity in fulfilling our engagements, the practice of strict justice, as well as the constant exercise of acts of benevolence and kindness. These are the great instruments of civilization, and through the use of them alone, can thie untutored child of the forest be induced to listen to its teachings.
                 [.]
                 The secretary of state, on whom the acts of congress have devolved the duty of directing the  for the taking of the sixth census, or enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States, will report to the two houses the progress of that iwork. The enumeration of persons has been completed, and exhibits a grand total of 17,069,453; making an increase over the census of 1830, 4,202,646 , and showing a gain in a ratio exceeding *329 per vent. for the last ten years.
                 [FINANCES.1
                 From the report of the secretary of the treasury, ? ou will be i formed of the condition of the finances.
                 ' balance ' n the treasury on the 1st of January last, as stated Mn the report of the secretary of the treasury, submitt%-d to congress at the extra session, was $987,345 03. The receipts into the treasury, during the first three quarters of this year, from all sources, amount to $23,467,072 52. The estimated receipts for the  quarter, amount to $6,943,095 25, amounting to $39,410,107 77; and making, with the balance in the treasury, on the first of January last, $31,397,512 80. The  for the first three quarters of this year, amount to $24,734,346 97. The expenditures for the fourth quarter, as estimated, will amount to $7,290,723 73-thus making a total of
                 32,025,070 70; and leaving a deficit to be provided for, on the first of Jan. next, of about $627,557 90.
                 Of the loan of $12,000,000, which -was authorised by congress at its late session, only pi,432,726 88 have been negotiated. The shortness of time which it had to run, has presented no inconsiderable impediment in the way of its being taken by capitalists at bome, while the same cause would have operated wvith much greater force in the foreign market. For that reason the foreign market has not been resorted to; and it is now submitted, whether it would not be advisable to amend the law by making what romains undisposed of payable at more distant day.
                 [TARIFF.]
                 Should it be necessary, in any view that congress may take of the subject, to revise the existing tariff of duties, I beg leave to say, that, in the performance of that most delicate operation, moderate counsels would seem to be the wisest. Trhe government under which it is our happiness to live, owes its  to the spirit of compromiso which prevailed among its framers-jarring and discordant opinions could only have been reconciled by that noble spirit of patriotism, which prompted conciliation, and resulted in harmony. In the same spirit the compro-
                 I mise bill, as it is commonly called, was adopted at
                 the session of 183g. While' the people of no portion of the union will ever hesitate to pay all necessary taxes for the support of government, yet an innate repugnance exists, to the imposition of  not really necessary for that object. In imposing duties, however, for the purpose of revenue, a right to discriminate as to the articles on which the  shall be laid, as well as the amount, necessarily and most properly exists. Otherwise the Government would be placed in the condition of having to levy the same duties upon all articles, the productive, as well as the unproductive. The slightest duty upon some, might have the effect of causing their importation to cease, whereas others entering extensively into the consumption of the country, might bear the heaviest, without any sensible diminution in the amount imported. So also the government may be justified in so discriminating, by reference to other considerations of domestic policy connected with our manufactures. So long as the duties shall be laid with distinct reference to the wants of the treasury, no well founded objection can exist against them. It might be esteemed desirable that no such  of the taxes should take place as would have the effect of annulling the land proceeds distribution act of the last session, which act is declared to be inoperative the moment the duties are increased beyond 20 per cent. the maximum rate established by the compromise act. Some of the provisions of the compromise act, which will go into effect on the 30th day of June next, may, however, be found exceedingly inconvenient in practice, under any regulations that congress may adopt. I refer more particularly to that relating to the home valuation. A difference in value of the same articles to some extent, will necessarily exist at different ports-but that is altogether insignificant, when compared with the conflicts in valuation, which arc likely to arise, from the differences of opinion among the numerous appraisers of merchandise. In many instances the estimates of value must be conjectural, and thus as many different rates of value may be established as there are appraisers.  differences in valuation may also be increased by the inclination, which without the slightest imputation on their honesty may arise on the part of the appraisers in favor of their respective ports of entry. I recommend this whole subject to the consideration of congress, with a single additional remark. Certainty and permanency in any system of governmental policy are, in all respects, eminently desirable; but more particularly is this true in all that affects trade and commerce, the operations of which depend much more on the certainty of their returns, and calculations which embrace distant periods of time, than on high bounties, or duties, which are liable to constant fluctuations.
                 [CURRENCY--FISCAL AGENTS.]
                 At your last session, I invited your attention to the condition of the currency and exchanges, and urged the necessity of adopting such measures as were consistent with the constitutional competency of the government, in order to correct the unsoundness of the one, and as far as practicable the inequalities of the other. No country can be in the enjoyment of its full measure of prosperity, without the presence of a medium of exchange, approximating to uniformity of value. What is necessary as between the different nations of the earth, is also important as between the inhabitants of different parts of the same country; with the first the precious metals constitute the chief medium of circulation, and such also would be the case as to the last, but for inventions comparatively modern, which have furnished, in place of gold and silver, a paper circulation. I do not propose to enter into a comparative analysis of the merits of the two systems. Such belonged more properly to the period of the introduction of the paper system. The speculative philosopher might find inducements to prosecute the inquiry, but his researches could only lead him to conclude, that the paper system had probably better never have been introduced, and that society might have heen much happier without it. The practical statesman has a very different task to perform. He has to look at things as they are-to take them as he finds themto supply deficiencies, and to prune excesses as far as in him lies. The task of furnishing a corrective for derangements of the paper medium with us, is almost inexpressibly great. The power exerted by the states to charter banking corporations, and which, having been carried to a great excess, has filled the country with, in most of the states, an irredeemable paper medium, is an evil which, in some way or other, requires a corrective. The rates at which bills of exchange are negotiated between different parts of the country, furnish an index of the value of the local substitute for gold and silver, which is, in many parts, so far depreciated, as not to be received, except at a large discount, in the payment of debts,
                 oib in the purchase of produce. It could earnestly be desired that every bank, n1t possessing the moans of resumption, should follow the example of the late 'United States lank of Pennsylvania, and go into liquidation, rather than by refusing to do. so to continue embarassments in the way of solvent institutions, thereby augmenting the difficulties incident to the present condition of things. Whether this  ment, with duo regard to the rights of the states, has any power to constrain the banks, either to resume specie payments or to force them into liquidation, is an inquiry which will not fail to claim your consideration. In view of the great advantages which are allowed the corporators, not among the least of which is the authority contained in most of their charters, to make loans to three times the amount of their capital, thereby often deriving three times as much interest on the same amount of money as any individual is permitted by law to receive, no sufficient apology can be urged for a  continued suspension of specie payments. Such suspension is productive of the greatest detriment to the public, by expelling from circulation the precious metals, and seriously hazarding the success of any effort that this government can make, to increase commercial facilities, and to advance the public interests.
                 This is the more to be regretted, and the indispensable necessity for a sound currency becomes the more manifest, when we reflect on the vast amount of the internal commerce of the country. Of this we have no statistics, nor just data for forming adequate opinions. But there can be no doubt, but that the amount of transportation coastwise, by sea, and the transportation inland by rail roads and canals, and by steamboats and other modes of conveyance, over, the surface of our vast rivers and immense lakes, and the value of property carried and interchanged by these means, form a general aggregate, to which the foreign commerce of the country, large as it is, maces but a distant approach.
                 In the absence of any controlling power over the subject, which by forcing a general resumption or specie payments would at once have the effect of restoring a sound medium of exchange, and would leave to the country but little to desire, what measure of relief, falling within the limits of our constitutional competency, does it become this government to adopt.? It was my painful duty at your last session, under the weight of most solemn obligations, to differ with congress on the measures which it proposed for my approval, and which it doubtless regarded as corrective of existing evils. Subsequent reflection, and events since occurring, have only served to confirm me in the opinions then entertained, and frankly .
                 I must be permitted to add, that no scheme of governmental policy, unaided by individual exertions, can be available for ameliorating the present condition of things. Commercial modes of exchange and a good currency, are but the necessary means of commerce and intercourse, not the direct productive sources of wealth. Wealth can only be accumulated by the earnings of industry and the savings of frugality; and nothing can be more ill-judged than to look to facilities in borrowing, or to a redundant circulation, for the power of discharging pecuniary obligations. The country is full of resources and the people full of energy, and the great and permanent remedy for present embarrassments must be sought in industry, economy, the observance of good faith, and the favorable influence of time.
                 [PLAN SUGGIgSTED.]
                 In pursuance of a pledge given to you in my last message to congress, which pledge I urge as an apology for adventuring to present you the details of any plan, the secretary of the treasury will be ready to submit to you, should you require it, a plan of finance which while it throws around the public treasure reasonable guards for its protection, and rests on powers acknowledged in practice to exist from the origin of the government, will, at the same time, furnish to the country a sound paper medium, and  all reasonable facilities for regulating the exchanges. When submitted, you will perceive in it a plan amendatory of the existing laws in relation to the treasury department-subordinate in all respects to the will of congress directly, and the will of the people indirectly-self-sustaining, should it be found in practice to realize its premises in theory, and  at the pleasure of congress. It proposes by effectual restraints, and by invoking the true spirit of our institutions, to separate the purse from the sword; or more properly to speak, denies any other control to the president over the agents who may be selected to carry it into execution, but what may be indispensably necessary to secure the fidelity of such agents; and, by wise regulations, keeps plainly apart from each other private and public funds. It contemplates the establishment of a board of control, at the scat of government, with agencies at prominent
                 commercial points, or wherever else congress sha direct, for the safe-keeping and disbursement of tl public moneys, and a substitution, at the option i the public creditor, of treasury notes, in lieu of gol and silver. It proposes to limit the issues to a amount not to exceed $15,000,000-without the ec press  of the legislative power. It also at  the receipt of individual  of gol and silver to a limited amount, and the granting cec  of deposite, divided into such sums as ma be called for by the depositors. It proceeds a ste further, and  the purchase and sale of dc mestic bills and drafts resting on a real and  tial basis, payable at sight, or having but a short tim to run, and drawn on places not  one  miles apart-which authority, except in so far as ma' be necessary for government purposes exclusively, i only to be exerted upon the express condition, tha its exercise shall not be prohibited by the state ii which the agency is situated.
                 In order to cover the expenses incident to the plan it will be authorised to receive moderate premium for certificates issued on , and on bills bough and sold, and thus, as far as its dealings extend, tb furnish facilities to commercial intercourse at th lowest possible rates, and to subduct from the earn ings of industry, the least possible sum. It uses th state banks at a distance from the agencies, as aux , without imparting any power to trade in it name. It is subjected to such guards and restraint as have appeared to be necessary. It is the creature of law, and exists only at the pleasure of the legis ]ature. It is made to rest on an actual specie basis in order to redeem the notes at the places of  no dangerous redundancy of  no temptation to speculation-is attended b, no inflation of prices-is equable in its  the treasury notes, which it may use  with the certificates of deposite, and the notes ol specie paying banks-convertible at the place wher collected, receivable in payment of  dues-and, without violating any principle of the constitution, affords the government and the pen. ple such facilities as are called for by the want of both. Such, it has appeared to me, are its rc commendations, and in view of them it will be sub mitted, whenever you may require it, to your consi. .
                 [OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED.]
                 I am not able to perceive that any fair and  ob  can be urged against the plan, the princi. pa outlines of which I have thus presented. 1 can. not doubt but that the notes which it proposes to fit u, nish, at the voluntary option of the public creditor, issued in lieu of the revenue and its certificates of , will be maintained at an equality with gold and silver, every where. They are  in gold and silver on demand, at the places of issue. They are receivable every where in payment of -rent dues. The treasury notes arc limited to an amount of one-fourth less than the estimated annual receipts of the treasury; and in addition they rest upon the faith of the government for their redemption. If all these assurances are not sufficient to make them available, then the idea, as it seems to me, of furnishing a sound paper medium of exchanges, may be entirely abandoned.
                 If a fear be indulged that the government may be tempted to run into excess in its issues, at any future day, it seems to me that no such apprehension can reasonably be entertained, until all confidence in the representatives of the states and of the people, as well as the people themselves, shall be lost. The weightiest considerations of policy require that the restraints now proposed to be thrown around the measure should not, for light causes, be removed.To argue against any proposed plan its liability to possible abuse, is to reject every expedient, since every thing dependent on human action is liable to abuse. Fifteen millions of treasury notes may be issued as the maximum, but a discretionary power is to be given to the board of control, under Ihat sum, and every consideration will unite in leading them to feel their way with caution. For the eight first years of the existence of the late Bank of the United States, its circulation barely exceeded $4,000,000; and for five of its most prosperous years, it was about equal to $16,000,000; furthermore, the authority given to receive private  to a limited amount, and to issue certificates in such sums as, may be called for by the depositors, may so far  upl) the channels of circulation as greatly to diminish the necessity of aty considerable issue of treasury notes. A restraint upon the amount of private  hlas  to be indispensably necessary, from an appre
                  thought to be well founded, that in any  of trade, confidence might be so far shaken in the banks as to  a withdrawal from  of private , with a view to ensure their unquestionable safety when deposited with the , N;hich
                 Ii might prove eminently disastrous to the state banks. e Is it objected that it is proposed to authorise the f agencies to deal in bills of exchange? It is answered, d that such dealings are to be carried on at the lowest n possible -are made to rest on an unquestionably
                 sound basis-are designed to re-imburse merely the expenses which would otherwise devolve I upon the treasury, and are in strict subordination to - the decision of the supreme court, in the case of the y Bank of Augusta against Earle, and other reported
                 cases; and thereby avoids all conflict with state jurisdiction, which I Bold to be indispensably requisite. . It leaves the banking privileges of the states without n interference-looks to the treasury and the  and, while furnishing every facility to the first, is ,careful of the interests of the last. But above all,
                 it is created by law, is amendable by law, and is re ; by law; and wedded as I am to no theory,
                 but looking solely to the advancement of the public good, 1 shall be amongst the very first to urge its repeal, if it be found not to subserve the purposes and objects for which it may be created. Nor will the Lplan be submitted in any overweening confidence, in
                 the sufficiency of my own judgment, but with much greater reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of congress. I cannot abandon this subject without urging upon you, in the most emphatic manner, whatever may be your action on the suggestions which I have felt it-to be my duty to submit, to relieve the chief executive magistrate by any and all constitutional means, from a controlling power over the publie treasury. If, in the plan proposed, should you deem it worthy of your consideration, that separation is not as complete as you may desire, you will, doubtless, amend it in that particular. For myself, I disclaim all desire to have any control over the public moneys, other than what is indispensably necessary, to execute the laws which you may pass.
                 [STATE DEBTS.]
                 Nor can I fail to advert, in this connection, to the debts which many of the states of the union have contracted abroad, and under which they continue to labor. That indebtedness amounts to a sum not less than $200,000,000, and which has been  to them1, for the most part, in works of internal improvement, which are destined to prove of vast importance in ultimately advancing their prosperity and wealth. For the debts thus contracted, the states are alone responsible. I can do no more than express the belief that each state will feel itself bound by every consideration of honor, as well as of interest, to meet its  with punctuality. The failure, however, of any one state to do so, should in no degree  the credit of the rest; and the foreign capitalist will have no just cause to experience alarm as to all other state stocks, because any one or more of the states may neglect to provide with punctuality the means of redeeming their engagements. Even such states, should there be any, considering the great rapidity with which their resources are developing themselves, will not fail to have the means, at no very distant day, to redeem their obligations to the uttermost farthing; nor will I doubt but that in view of that honorable conduct which has evermore governed the states, and the people of this union, they will each and all resort to every legitimate expedient, before they will forego a faithful compliance  their obligations.
                 [WAR DEPARTMENT.]
                 From the report of the secretary of war, and other reports accompanying it, you will be informed of the progress which has been made in the fortifications designed for the protection of our principal cities,  and inland frontier, during the present year; together with their true state and condition. They will be prosecuted to completion with all the expedition which the means placed by congress at the disposal of the executive will allow.
                 I recommend particularly to your consideration, I  portion of the secretary s report which proposes 4 the establishment of a chain of military po3ts, fromI Council Blufls to sonic point on the Pacific ocean, ( within our limits. The benefit thereby destined to ( accrue to our citizens engaged in the fur tade, over I that wilderness region, added to the importance of cultivating friendly relations with savage tribes
                  it, and at the same time of giving protection l to our frontier settlements, and of establishing the c means of safe intercourse between the American set- E  at the mouth of the Columbia river, and E those on this side of the Rocky mountains,  s seem to suggest the importance of carrying into effect r the recommendations upon this head with as little I delay as may be practicable.
                 [NAVY DEPARTMENT.] t
                 The report of the secretary of the Davy, will place h you in possession of the present condition of that important arm of the national defence. Every effort
                 will be made to add to its efficiency, and I cannot too e wrongly urge upon you, liberal appropriations to that 1I
                 ;branch of the public service. Inducements of the weightiest character exist for the adoption of  course of policy. Our extended and. otherwise ex. posed maritime frontier, calls for protection, to the furnishing of which an efficient naval force is indispensable. We look to no foreign conquests, nor do we propose to enter into competition with any other nation for supremacy on the ocean-but it is due not only to the honor, but to the security of the people of the United States, that no nation should be permitted to invade our waters at pleasure, and sub. ect our towns and villages to conflagration or pillage. Economy in all branches of the public service is due from all the public agents to the people-but parsimony alone would suggest the withholding of the  means, for the protection of our domestic
                 firesides from invasion, and our national honor from disgrace. I would most earnestly recommend to congress, to abstain from all appropriations, for ob. jects not absolutely necessary; but I take upon myself, without a moment of hesitancy, all the responsibility of recommending the increase and prompt equipment of that gallant navy, which has lighted up every sea with its victories, and spread an imperishable glory over the country.
                 [POST OFFICE .]
                 The report of the postmaster general will claim your particular attention, not only because of the valuable suggestions which it contains, but because of the great importance which, at all times, attaches to that interesting branch of the public service. The increasing expense of transporting the mail along the principal routes, necessarily claims the public attention, and has awakened a corresponding solicitude on the part of the government. ThIe transmission of the mail must keep pace with those facilities of intercommunication wh ich are every day becoming greater through the building of rail roads, and the application of steam power-but it cannot be disguised that, in order to do so, the post office department is subjected to heavy exactions. The lines of communication between distant parts of the union, are, to a great extent, occupied hy rail roads, which, in the nature of things, possess a complete monopoly, and the department is therefore liable to heavy and unreasonable charges. This evil is destined to great increase in future, and some timely measure may become necessar- to guard against it.
                 [APPOINThIr.NTS TO OFFICE.]
                 I feel it my duty to bring  your consideration a practice which has grown up in the administration of the government, and which, I am deeply convinced, ought to be corrected. I allude to the exercise of the power, which , rather than reason, has vested in the presidents, of removing incumbents from office, in order to substitute others more in favor with the dominant party. My own conduct, irk this respect, has been governed by a conscientious purpose to  the removing power, only in cases of unfaithfulness or inability, or in those in which its exercise appeared necessary, in order to, discountenance and suppress that spirit of active partisanship on the part of holders of office, which not only withdraws them from the steady and impartial discharge of their official duties, hut exerts ani undue and injurious influence over elections, and degrades the-character of the government itself, inasmuch as it exhibits the chief magistrate, as being a party, through his agents, in the secret plots or open workings of political parties.
                 In respect to the exercise of this power, nothing should be left to  eion, which may safely be re** ;ulated by law; and it is of high importance to , as far as poss;ible, the  of personal interests in public elections. Considering the great in-rease which has, been  in public offices. in the last quarter of a century. and the probability of far.her increase, we incur the hazard of witnessing  political contests,  too often to the single  of retaining office, by those who are in, or  it, by those who are out. UInderthe influence if these convictions, I shall cordially concur in any Constitutional measures for regulating, and by , restraining, the power of removal.
                 [ FUND.]
                 I suggest for your consideration, the propriety of , without further delay, some specific appliation of the funds derived  the will of Mr. , of England, for the diffusion of knowledge; nd which have, heretofore, been vested in public tocks, until such time as congress should think proer to give them a specific direction. Nor will you, feel confident, permit any abatement of the princial of the legacy to be made, shouli it turn out that he stocks, in which the investments have been made, ave undergone a depreciation.
                 [DISTRIC T OF COLUMBIA.]
                 In conclusion, I commend to your care the Intern sts of this District, for which youi are the exclusive *. Considering that this city is the resi-
                 of the government, and, for a large part of the year, of congress, and, considering also, the great cost of the public buildings, and the propriety of affording them at all times careful protection, it seems not unreasonable that congress should contribute towards the expense of an efficient pAce.

UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.
Decisions Announced Yesterday validity
of the Driven Well Patent.
Washington. May 23. The United States
Snpreme Court briefly announced decisions
to-day in about twenty cases, and then ad­
journed until Friday. Leading counsel in
the telephone cases were present, out a ue-
cision in tnose cases was not renaerea.
Among the cases of general Interest were
the following:
No. 120. Harris E. Ames against W. D.
Andrews and others. Appeal from the
United States Circuit Court for the District
of Connecticut, The controversy in this
case relates to tbe validity of wbat is known
as ""the driven-well patent."" The import
ance of this litigation, and the extent to
which the people of the country are Inter
ested, is shown by the fact that the number
of driven-wells in the United States is some
where between 500,000 and 1,000,000. The
court holds. (Crst). that the grounds upon
which it is sought to invalidate the re-
istued ratent for the driven wells as being
for a different invention from that described
in the original patent, can not be sustained ;
fsfcond). that the invention had not been
anticipated by others and, (third), that
tbere is a clear case of infringement The
val'ditv of re-issued patent No. 4.372 issued
to Nelson W. Green is therefore sustained
and the decree of the Circuit Court affirmed.
Orinion by Justice Matthews.
10. A. a. ieeaie sgainss r rana j.
Bennet and others. Appeal from the
United States Circuit Court for tbe North
District of Ohio. This is also a driven well
patent case. Upon the grounds set forth in
the opinion in the preceding case the val
idity of the patent is sustained and the ap
pellant he d liable lor lniringement. vine
effect of the decision In these two cases is
io render all uses ot driven wells not
authorize.1, under tbe Green patent liable
ta damages for infringement.
No. lo6. The sun ju.utuai insurance
Company, of New York, and others, against
the Kountz Kine Yeager Transportation
Company, the Kountz Transportation
Company, and the .aioore lTansporTauon
Comrjanv. Appeal from the United States
Circuit Court for the Eastern District of
Louisiana. This was a suit to recover the
valneof a cargo of produce lost by the
sinking of the steamer Henry C. x eager,
in the Mississippi liiver below bt. iiouis, in
May 18S0. Tbe court holds that upon the
finding of the facts the four transportation
r.nmnanies were iointly liable for the loss
of the produce: of the steamer Yeager, and
that the Circuit court errea in not so noia-
Ire. Its decision Is therefore reversed.

Mr. Belmont presidinc. received the report
of the sub-committee on the retaliation bill
The chairman e-iid that in these question!
the committee liad always acted without
regard to partisanship and be hoped it
would continue to do so. He referred to
the fact that a bill Introduced by himself
two years ago, containing a restrictive rail­
road provision, had been adopted by the
house almost unanimously, thoujrh the
railroad section was subsequently stricken
out in the senate, iue committee unan­
imously adopted the amended bill reported
bv the sub-committee.
Mr. Belmont having been absent when
the consideration of the subject was begun,
expressed the opinion that it would be
proper for Mr. McCready to report the bill
to tne house. It is understood to be the
intention to call it up for action on Satur­
day next.
The following is the text of the substi­
tute bill:
""A bill to empower the president to
carry out the puroses of an act to author­
ize the President of the United States to

satisfied that such discrimination has

effect in his discretion, whereupon the toll
authorised by this act shall no longer be

At only one point was there anything
like a difference between the Democratic
and Republican members. This was upon
a proposition coming from the Itepulicans
that courtesy to Great Britain required
that should be notilied that article 2"". of
the treaty of Washington had been practi­
cally nullified and abrogated uimiii the re­
fusal or denial of the rights of American
citizens in Canadi'Ji ports. Upon this
proposition there was a division upon party
lines, resulting iu its defeat by a vote of

When the question came up on ordering
a favorable report on a substitute bill, how­
ever, there was not a negative vote. Th
Bepublican members do not expect ths.t
tbs bill will meet with.any opposition from
their side of the House when It is called
up, although the proposition which was re­
jected yesterday may be renewed and servo
as a basis of some speeches in which the
position will be taken that the President

was preliminary to others which probably

Joint declaration those present expressed
themselves as satisfied that the result
would be to promote both interests and
that an important step had been taken in
bringing them nearer together.
Hem Who Were a tho Meeting-.
The meeting resulted from correspon­
dence between Wilhelm and Senators Tel­
ler of Colorado, Dubois of Idaho, Carter
and Mantle of Montana, Cannon of Utah
and Jones of Nevada. These senator
were all present at the meeting, as were
Representatives Hartmaa of Montana,Al­
len of Utah and Wilson of Idaho, and
also twenty-five representatives of manu­
facturing ill to rests in wouleus, worsteds,
groceries, yarns, eta
Silver CoIbbo or No Tariff.
The conference waa organized by choos­
ing .Senator Dubois as chairman and Wil­
helm aa secretary. Brief speeches were
niado by all tho senators present. They
denned their position in such a manner as
to make it plain to tho mauufacturor
that there could be no protective tariff
legislation either at this session of con­
gress or the nextwithont tbe rehabilita­
tion of silver, and that bimetallism and
protection as regarded from their stand­
point constituted an Indivisible, issue be­
fore the country. Some of the manufac­
turers themselves indorsed this position
as being the logic of the country's necessi­
ties and political conditions.
Void aa Koemv to Protection.
President Dornan, of the Manufac­
turers' club of Philadelphia, expressed
tho opinion that the tariff duties could not
be made hig'i enough to protect our man­
ufacturers if our country remained on a
gold basis. James Dobson came out un­
qualifiedly for free coinage by interna
tional agreement if possible, otherwise
by independent action. He bitlieved that
Independent action would induce interna­
tional action. Free coinago might create
temporary disturbances, but it was the
quickest way to permanent relief from
the Ills from which the country is now
suoering.

had labored in season and out of season to
convince manufacturers that protection
would only prove efficacious in conjunc

the restoration of silver, but thought that
the cause of bimetallism was not advanced
by the defeat of tbe revenue measure.

that this was the first note of warning to

The.result was accomplished after twelve
hours of. continuous debate. But tvwa
speeches were made by the Republicans,
one by Mr. Dingley in opening the debate,.
and one by Mr. Payne of New York in
closing it. The Democrats were thus forced
to put forth speaker after speaker, but
their bombardment of the Republican posi­
tion was unanswered.­ In all ten Demo­
cratic and one Populist speeches were
nade, Messrs. Wheeler of Alabama, Swan­
son of Virginia, Ball of Texas, Lanham of.
Texas, Kelly of North Dakota, Fleming of.
Georgia, Handy of Delaware, McDowell of
Ohio, Berry of Kentucky, Bailey of Texas
and McMillan of Tennessee being the
speakers.
The sugar schedule was the main point
of assault, but the most interesting fea­
ture of the debate occurred when Mr. Bailey,
and Mr. McMillin, the two rival Democratic
leaders, crossed­ swords on the question of
orthodoxy of the free raw material doc­
trine, the former opposing and the latter""'
championing it.

time the vote was taken, many distin­

MXembers Were Excited.
* The floor of the house presented an ant­
mated scene, to-day, before the speaker
rapped that body to order.­ Members stool
about in groups and discussed, sometimes
in excited tone, the result of the confer­
ence agreement on the Tariff bill. The final
conference report on the General Deficiency
Appropriation bill was adopted.
This out of the way, Mr. Dingley arose.
Holding aloft the report and a great mass
Sof papers, he said in calin tones: ""Mr.
Speaker,; I desire to present the conference
report on the Tariff bill."" -
SSalvos .of applause from the Republical
side greeted this azinouncement.

An effort was made to secure an agree.

nority desired. three days, but knowing
they could not obtain them, would be sat.

.. Mr. Dingley -refused to agree to this,
saying: ""Talk at this time is very ex­
pensive. It costs the treasury $100,000 aX
day.""
""Not so expensive as the ten-days you
spent in arranging the sugar schedule with­
the Sugar trust,"" retorted Mr. Railey amid
counter round of applause by his foolow,
ers.
Mr. Dingley, in reply pointed out that
never before in Iegislative history had a
tariff -bill been in conference so brief a­
time. The McKinley bill had been in con­
ference two weeks. ""And our friends on
the other side,"" said he, addressing the
Democrats, ""in 1894 were in conference six
weeks without reaching an .agreement.""
""The trouble in 1894,"" retorted Mr. Bat­
ley, ""was that we were trying to run the
Democratic party with a lot of Mugwumps
in command."" [Laughter and applause on
the Democratic side.]
Mr. Dingley continued his efforts to fi
a time for a vote, the Republicans during
the discussion crying ""Vote, vote, vote.""
""I suggest we wait until Sugar stock goeod
up a little higher,"" said Mr. Bailey sar­
castically. ""It has gone up $6 a share since
the agreement was reported.""

When Mr. Dingley referred to the

of taxing ""the stock gamblers of Wall­

""Not at all,"" replied Mr. Dingley. ""WS

Commission, by a vote of eight against seven,
have decided that no evidence can be admit­
ted or considered by them in the Florida case
except the various electoral certificates, and
such evidence as shall be submitted on the
question of the eligibility of Humphreys as
Presidential Elector.
The vote stood in favor of the decision­
justices Strong, Miller and Bradley, and
Senators Edmunds, Morton and Frelinghuy­

Against—Justices Clifford and Field, and
Senators Thurman and Bayard, and Repre­

The Commission adjourned until 11 o'clock
to-morrow, when the proceedings will be in
public.
Washington, February 7.— The Electoral
Commission commenced its session to-day at
10 o'clock and continued until 4 o'clock. A
large crowd of interested persons was in front
of the doors of the court room, expressing
great anxiety to learn the result of their de­
liberations. As the members of the commis­
sion came into the lobby on their way out of
the Capitol, they were eagerly surrounded by
their personal friends and interrogated. As
the injunction bf secrecy had been removed,
there was no objection to giving the desired
information. The following is a minute on
the official record of the commission :
On motion of Justice Miller, it was ordered
that ne evidence will be received or consid­
ered by the commission w'hich was not sub­
mitted to the joint convention of the two
Houses by the President of the Senate with
the different certificates, except such as re­
lates to the eligibility of F. C. Humphreys,
elector. The vote stood as follows :
Ayes— Bradley, Edmunds, Frelinghuysen,
Garfield, Hoar, Miller, Morton and Strong—8.
Noes—Abbott, Bayard, Clifford, Field,
Ilunton, Payne and Thurman—7.
On motion of Abbott, it was resolved that
in the case of Florida this commission will
receive evidence relating to the eligibility of
Frederick C. Humphreys, the person named
in certificate No. 1 as an elector.
Ayes—Abbott, Bayard, Bradley, Clifford,
Field, Hunton, Payne and Thurman—8.
Noes—Edmunds, Frelinghuysen, Garfield,
Hoar, Miller, Morton and Strong—7.
The Secretary of the commission in­
formed the counsel on the respective sides that
at 11 o'clock to-morrow it will be prepared to
hear argument on the question of the eligi­
bility of F. C. Humphreys as an elector.
Humphreys is one of the Republican elec­
tors, and the question raised as to his eligi­
bility is that he was at the date of his election
a United States Shipping Commissioner, which
is alleged to be such an office of trust or profit
as to disqualify him from acting as an elector,
but which office, the Republicans assert, he
resigned before his election. The commis­
sion, by their decision to-day, will have be­
fore them in the Florida case three sets of
papers—a certificate of the Hayes electors,
that of the Tilden electors, and a paper con­
taining the record of the Circuit Court of
L lorida on the quo warranto , and the subse­
quent action of the Legislature of that State.
1 he Republicans express themselves gratified
with the decision of the commission, while
the Democrats are somewhat discouraged.
1 he former claim that no consequences will

of the Circuit Court of Florida, as they are
now under appeal to the Supreme Court of
that State, and therefore are not final. It
seems to be the prevalent belief that the ulti­
mate decision will be in favor of the Hayes
electors, and the course in this case will he pur­
sued in regard to Louisiana, where there are
two alleged ineligible electors and more than
one return. A prominent Democrat of the
commission said this afternoon that the mean­
ing of the vote of the commission is that the
ministerial acts of the State Executive are to
be respected, but not those of the Judiciary.

He added, however, that as the Democratic
certificates embody the proceedings of the
court, they will by this decision be fully
opened up for cqnsideration and argument.
The Democrats also find some satisfaction in
the fact that the rule established by the com­
mission will lead to the ascertainment that

TARIFF BILL MONDAY.
An Incidental ,.ebate on Trusts
Leads to a Severe Arraignment of
the Sugar' Tru t'Iknd a General Dis­
cussion of Means to Deal With
Trusts by Mr:I ?oar.
Washington, D.-C June 28.--The senate
made good progress pn the Tariff bill, to­
day, disposing of' the paragraphs relating
to hides which halve been the source of
much controversyAloAs finally agreed on,
the duty on hides Wi­ placed at 20 per cent.
ad valorem, in pl'aeW of 11, cent a pound
as originally repo lt-.by the Finance com­
mittee. The discusion was protracted,
drifting into a general debate on trusts,
and from that back to the Sugar trust.
Mr. Smith (N, J.) spoke at length against
the duty on hides, while Mr. Allen (Neb.)
supported the duty. The new paragraph
was agreed to, 39-20, one Democrat, Raw­
lins of Utah, and several Populists and
Silver Republicans voting with the Repub­
licans in the affirmative. The incidental
debate on trusts led to severe arraignment
of the Sugar trust by Messrs. Caffery and
Lindsay and a general discussion of the
means to deal with trusts by Mr. Hoar.
Among other paragraphs disposed of dur­
ing the day were all those relating to
gloves, a substitute for the paragraph on
live animals, iron ore and stained glass
windows.
Foreigners to Be Invited.
The resolution authorizing the president
to invite foreign­ governments to partici­
pate in the trans-Mississippi exposition at
Omaha was agreed to.
The Tariff bill was then taken up. Par­
agraphs 86, gypsum and 88, clays or earth,
went over.
The paragraph relating to stained or
painted glass windows was changed slight­
ly in phraseology and the duties agreed to
as reported.
On the iron ore paragraph, the pending
provision gave a duty of. 40 cents a ton on
iron ore, including manganiferous iron ore
and the dross or residuum from burnt
pyrites, with a proviso relating to the ac­
count to be taken of moisture in weighing
the ore. Mr. Allison offered new amend­
ments which were agreed to, adding to the
first clause of the paragraph as reported,
""manganese ore, $1 per ton""; also at the
end of the proviso, ""basic slag, ground or
unground, $1 per ton.""

a Resolution Passed which Nine-Tenths

War with Spain.
Washington, April 13.--The House this afternoon passed this reso­
lution.. The vote on adopting the resolution was 322 ayes to 19 nays:
Whereas, The government of Spain for' three years past has been
waging a war on the island of Cuba against a revolution by the inhabi­
tants thereof, without making subs tantial progress toward the suppires­
sion of said revolution, and has con ducted the warfare in a mannei con­
trary to the laws of nations by methods inhuman and uncivilized, caus­
ing the death by starvation of more than 200,000 innocent noii-com­
batants, the victims being for the most part helpless women and chil..
dren, inflicting intolerable injury to the commercial interest of the
United States, involving the destruction of lives ""and property of many
of our citizens, entailing the expenditure of mills of dollars in pa­
trolling our coasts, and policing 'the high seas iinorrder to maintain our
neutrality, and
Whereas, This long series of lo sses, injuries and burdens for which
Spain is responsible has culminated in the destruction of the United
States battleship ""Maine"" in the harbor of Havana, and in the death
of 266 of our seamen,
Resolved, That the President is hereby authorized and directed to
'intervene at once to stop the war in Cuba, to the end and the purpose
of securing permanent peace and or der there, and establishing by the
free action of the people there of a stable and independent goveriinmeit
of their own in the island of Cuba; and the President is hereby ati
thorized to use the land and naval forces of the United States to exe­
cute the purpose of this resolution.
Washington, April 13.-The House of
Representatives today, after one of the
most exciting and memorable days in
its history, by a vote of 322 to 19, adopt­
ed a resolution which nine-tenths of its
members believe makes war with Spain
inevitable.
It is a fact which was grimly corm­
mented upon today by members as they
spoke of the future, that every war in
which the United States has engaged
began in April, and that today was the
anniversary of the fall of Fort Sumter,
which aroused the patriotic fervor of the
North and made the four years of civil
strife a certainty.
The resolutions adopted direct the
President to intervene at once in Cuba,
to restore peace and secure to the peo­
ple of this island ""a stable and inde­
pendent Government of their own,"" and
authorizes him to use the army and
navy to execute the purpose of the
resolutions.
Although only nineteen members--fif­
teen Democrats, three Republicans and
one Populist-dissented upon the final
vote, the proceedings were marred by a
bitter and acrimonious display of par­
tisan feeling.
DISGRACEFUL SCENE.
During the height of the excitement
the lie was passed between Mr. Brumm
(Rep., Pa.) and Mr, Bartlett (Dem.,
Ga.), and a disgraceful scene followed
that almost descended to the level of
a free fight. Order was finally restored
and later the two members found that
the altercation had arisen out of a
misunderstanding, whereupon there
wei'e mutual apologies.
Later in the proceedings the Speaker
was obliged to call upon the sergeant­
at-arms With his silver mace, the em­
blem of the I:touse's authority, to seat
Tlr. Johnson of Indiana, who was In­
dignantly remonstrating against what
he ter~tled the ""unnecessary War into
which the country was being pluniged.""
Only forty minutes were given for de­
bate, end special rules were required
to get the resolutions before the House.
The minority resolutions, which de­
clared folr the recognition of the exist­
ing Government of the insurgents, were
voted down, 147 to 1.90, but they secured.
the votes of three Republicans. Some
stirring and patriotic sentiments were
voiced during the debate, which lifted
the galleries and the members to a
high pitch of enthusiasm.
Mr.. Adams of Pennsylvania, acting
chairma.n of the Foreign Affairs com­
mittee, and Mr. Dinsmore (Dem., Ark.),
the senior minority member of the corn­
mnittee, were the only members who had
an opportunity to speak directly to the
resolutions, but Mr. Henderson of Iowa,
Mr. Bailey of Texas and Mr. McMillin
of Tennessee each miade speeches upon
the special order.
LIKE A BELEAGUERED CITADEL.
The capitol' was again like a be­
leaguered citadel. Thousands upon
thousands swarmed into the corridors
and galleries to witness the scefies and
to hear the stirring oratory. The gal­
leries of the House were a solid mass
of humanity, and on the floors mem­
bers in excited groups were discussing
the situation.
Mr. Adams, acting chairman of the
Foreign Affairs committee, came into
the hall with a copy of the Senate reso­
lutions, and was immediately surround­
ed and forced to read them aloud to
lihalf a hundted members who gathered
in the main aisle.
Trivial matters occupied the attention
of the House for the first hour, while
the members and the spectators in
the galleries impatiently awaited the
presentation of the resolution from the
Committee on Foieign' Affairs. The
suspense of the members was almost
unendurable, but shortly before 3
o'olock, Mr. Adams of Pennsyllania,
the acting chairman of the committee,
entered the hall with the report.
Instantly a hush fell upon the vast
assemblage. The presentation of the
resolution was, the occasion of a wild
outbuitst of. applause from the galleries
and the flboi. It \Vas evident that the
war spirit Wvas rampant. Mr. Adams
asked unanimous consent for the con­
sideration of the resolutions, and Mr.
Bailey reserved the right to object, say­
ing that whether he objected or not
would depend upon whether a fair un­
derstanding, was to the length of the
debate coUtld be reached.

much confusion and cries of ""Regular

facing the chair, entered an objection
in emphatic tones. The whole Demo­

""They are simply playing for politi­
cal advantage and the people of the

shouted Mr. Richardson (Dem., Tenn;).
""Thei'e is a perfect understanding

THE REPORT OF SECRETARY BLISS.
Work of the Dawes Commission Legisla­
tion Recommended tor the Twelfth
Census The Needs of Alaska
The Nicaragua CanaE""
Washington, Nov. 19. Secretary of
the Interior Bliss, in his annual re­
port, made public last night, submits
estimates aggregating 8150,532,419 for
appropriations by congress for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1S99. Dis­
cussing pensions, he says 200,000 pen­
bion claims are awaiting adjudication,
and it is estimated that 40 or 50 per
cent, of these will be finally admitted.
If they are rapidly adjudicated they
will swell the pension roll from $5,000,­
000 toS7,000,000. When, however, these
claims are adjudicated- and the first
payments made thereon the amount of
the pension roll will decrease very rap­
idly, possibly to Sl'25,000,000 or S130,­
000,000 the first year.
The total Indian population of the
United States, exclusive of the New
York and the five civilized tribes, ap­
proximates 177,178, located on 177 res­
ervations, which contain approxi­
mately 33,404,837 acres. Of these, 4,545
have accepted allotments of land which
aggregate about 64-,? 17 acres. Secre­
tary Bliss says that while the opening
of the Wichita reservation In Okla­
homa to white settlement would great­
ly -promote the development of the
country, yet in view of the unsettled
condition of the questions affecting
their rights until there is further leg­
islation, he does not see how it can be
done without causing great injury and
distress. Referring to the work of the
Dawes commission, it is announced
that the investigation of the rights of
applicants for citizenship in the five
nations has been practically completed;
the commission has been preparing
the rolls of citizenship of the several
tribes and has negotiated three
agreements. That with both the Choc­
taws and Chickasaws of April 23, 1897,
is before congress, and has been rati­
fied by those tribes. That made with
the Creeks September 27 last was re­
jected almost unanimously by the
Creek council, and there is little pros­
pect of any further agreement with
them. The Cberokees have refused to
make agreement, and negotiations
with them have been abandoned for
the time being. Such arrangements
as have been concluded vary so in their
provisions that, in view of the fact
that eventually a uniform system of
government must be provided for the
Indian territory, it is questionable, the
report says, whether any of the agree­
ments should be definitely ratified by
congress until the desired and neces­
sary uniformity can be secured.
Speedy action in securing proper
legislaltion for the coming 12th census
is urged, lack of sufficient time in the
past two or three enumerations is com­
plained of and the necessity of many
reforms in the way of lessening the
bulk of reports and the elimination of
several branches of inquiries in the
12th census, either by postponement
or transfer to bureaus already in exist­
ence, is urged.
It is anticipated that before the close
of the field season the geological sur­
vey will have gathered sufficient data
as to the settled area of the reserves
embraced in the executive forestry or­
ders to enable the. department to form
an opinion as to population and im­
provements included within the re­
serves and the distribution of the for­
est and agricultural lands.
Concerning Alaska, Secretary Bliss
says existing conditions demand a
radical change in the laws relating
thereto, and he recommends that the
public land laws be extended to that
district, that additional land offices be­
created and appropriations made to
carry them into effect; that the grant­
ing of rights-of-way for railroad tele­
graph and telephone lines and the con­
struction of roads and trails be speci­
fically authorized; that provision be
made for the incorporation of munici­
palities, providing for the holding of
elections, defining qualifications for
voting, and giving such powers as are
used and exercised by municipalities
elsewhere; that the legal and political
status of the native population, which
is in doubt, be defined; that citizenship
be extended to the Metlakahtla In­
dians -who emigrated from British
Columbia and under authority of an
act of congress, approved March 3,
1S91, now occupy Annette island; that
complete territorial government be
authorized and established, and that
representation in congress be granted.

' Address to the People of the Confederate
States.
In compliance with the request of Congress,
contained in resolutions passed on
the fourth day of the current month, I invoke
your attention to the present condition
and future prospects of our couotry,
and to the duties which patriotism imposo
on us all during this great struggle for our
! homes and our liberties. These resolutions
are in the following language :
Joint Resolution Relating to tiie
Production of Provisions.?Whereas,
a strong impression prevails through the
country that the war now being waged against
the people of the Confederate States
may terminate during the present year; and
wherees, this impression is leading many
patriotic citizens to engage largely in the
production of cotton and tobacco,' which
they woulchnot otherwise do; and* whereas,
in the opinion of Cougress, it is of the utmost
importance, not only with a view to
the proper subsistence of our armies, but
for the interest and welfare of all the people,
that the agricultural labor of the country
should be employed chiefly in the production
of a supply of food to meet every

contingency. Therefore,
Resolved, by the Congress of the Confederate
States of America, That it is the
deliberate judgment of Congress that the
people of these States, while hoping for
peace, should look to prolonged war as the
only condition proffered by the enemy short
of subjugation; that every preparation necessary
to encounter such a war should be
persisted in, and that the amplest supplies
of provisions for armies and people should
be the first object of all agriculturists;
wherefore, it is earnestly recommended that
the people, instead of plantiog cotton and
tobacco, shall direct their agricultural labor
mainly to the production of such crops
as will insure a sufficiency of food for all
classes and for every emergency, thereby,
with true patriotism, subordinating the
hope of gain to the certain good of the country.
Seo. 2. That the President is hereby
requested to issue a proclamation to the
people of these States, urging upon them
the necessity of guarding against the great
perils of a short crop of provisions, and
setting forth such reasons therfor as his
judgment may dictate.
- Fully concurring in the views thus expressed
by the Congress, I confidently appeal
to your love of country for aid in car.

rying into eneci me recommendations 01
your Senators and llepresentatives.
We have reached the close of the second
year of the war, apd may point with just
pride to the history of our young Confederacy.
Alone, unaided, we have met and j
overthrown the most powerful combination
of military and naval armaments that the
lust of conquest ever gathered together for i
the subjugation of a free people. We began
this struggle without a single gun afloat,
while the resources of our enemy enabled
them to gather fleets, which, according
to their official list, published in August
last, consisted of 427 vessels, measuring
340,036 tons, and carrying 3,208 gnus.
Yet we have captured, sunk or destroyed a
number of those vessels, including two
large frigates and ouo steam s!oop of-war,
wbilo four of their captured steam gun-boats
are now in our possession, adding to the ,
strength of our little navy, which is rapid- 1
ly gaining in numbers and efficiency. To i
oppose invading forces, composed of levies
which have already exceeded thirteen hundred
thousand men, we had no resources
but the uuconquerablo valor of a people determined
to be free; and we were so destitute
of military supplies that tens of thousands
of our citizens were reluctantly refused
admission into the service from our inability
to provide them with arms, while for
many months some of our important strongholds
owed their safety chiefly to a careful
concealment of the fact we were without a
supply of powder for our cannon. Your devotion
and patriotism have triumphed over
all these obstaoles, and called intdexistence
the munitions of war, the clothing, and the
subsistence which have enabled our soldiers
to illustrate their valor ou numerous
battle-fields, and inflict crushing defeats on
successive armies, each of which an arro- .
gant foe fondly imagined to be invincible.

ent condition is well calculated to inspire
fail confidence in the triumph of our arms.
At no previous period of the war have our
forces been bo numerous, so well organized
and so thoroughly disciplined, armed and
equipped, as at present. The season of high
water, on whioh our enemies relied to i
enable their fleets of gun-boats to penetrate
into our country and devastate our homes,
is fast passing away. Yet our strongholds J
on the Mississippi still bid defiance to the j
foe, and months of costly preparations for i i
their reduction have been spent in vain.? >
Disaster has been the result of their every i
effort to turn or to storm Vicksburg and |
Port Hudson, as well as of every attack on
our batteries on the Red River, the Tallahatchie
and other navigable streams.?
Within a few weeks, the failing waters and ,
the increasing heats of summer will com- ,
plete their discomfiture, and compel their
baffled and defeated forces to the abandonment
of expeditions on which was based
their chief hopes or success in effecting our ,
subjugation. ,
We must not forget, however, that the
war is not yet ended, and that we are still 1
confronted by powerful armies and threa- i
tened by numerous fleets, and that the Gov- &lt;
eminent which controls these fleets and ar----?
*? 1 .i ?i J

lines is uriveu 10 me most uespeiuiu cuuim
to effect tbc unholy purposes in which it I
has thus far been defeated. It will use its :
utmost energy tosavert the impeuding doom, ]
so fully merited by the atrocities it has com- ]
mitted, the savage barbarities which it has
encouraged, and the crowning iufamy of I
its attempts to excite a servile population &lt;
to the massacre of our wives, our daugh- i
ters and helples9 children.
With suoh a contest before us, there is i

bat one danger which the Government of i
your choice regards with apprehension, and I
to avert this danger, it appeals to the never* ]
failing patriotism and spirit of self sacrifice
which you have exhibitod since the begin- i
ning of the war. The very unfavorable I
season, the protracted droughts of last year, ]
reddced the harvests on which we depen- I
ded far below an average yield, and the i
deficiency was unfortunately still more '
marked in the Northern portion of the ]
Confederacy, where supplies were specially i
needed for the army. If, through a confidence
in early peace, which may prove de- J
lusive, our fields should be now devoted to i
the production of cotton and tobaoco, io- '1
stead of grain and live stock, and other articles
necessary for the subsistence^ of the
people and the army, the consequence may
prove serious, if not disastrous, especially :

able as the last. Your country, therefore i
appeals to you to aside all thought of gain, 1
and to devote yourselves to securing your i
liberties, without which these gains would
be valueless. It is true that the wheat &lt;
harvest in the more Southern States, which
will be gathered next month, promises an
abundant yiold; but even if this promise
bo fulfilled, the difficulty of transportation,
enhanced as it has been by an unusoally
rainy winter, will cause embarrassments in
military operations and suffering among the
people should the crops in the middle and
Northern portions of the Confederacy prove
deficient. But no uneasiness need be felt
in regard to a mere supply of bread for man. '
It is for the large amount of corn and forage
required for the raising of live stock,
and for the supply of the animals used in
military operations, that your aid is speci- 1
ally required. These articles are too bulky
for distant transportation, and in them the
deficiency in the last harvest was most felt.
Let your fields be devoted exclusively to
the production of corn, oats, beans, peas,
potatoes aod other food for man and beast.
Let corn be sown broadcast for fodder,. in- >
immediate proximity to rail roads, rivers
and canals, and let all your efforts be di- '
rected to the prompt supply of these articles 1

in the distriets where our armies are operating.
Fou will thus add greatly to their 1
efficiency, and furnish the means without 1
which it is impracticable to make those 1
prompt aod active movements which have 1
hitherto stricken terror, into our enemies,
and secured our most brilliant triumphs.
Having thus placed before you, my countrymen,
the reasons for the call made on
you for aid in supplying the wants of the
coming year, I add a few words of appeal
in behalf of tho brave soldiers now confronting
your enemies, and to whom your Government
js unable to furnish all the comforts
they so riohly merit. The Bupply of
meat for the army is deficient. This deficiency
is only temporary, for measures havebeen
adopted which will, it is believed,
soon enable us to restore the full ration.?
But that ration is now reduced at times to
one-half the usual quantities in some of our
armies. It is known that the supply of
meat throughout tho country is sufficient
for the support of all, but the distances arc
so great, the condition of the roads has been
&amp;o bad during the five months of winter weather
through which wo have just passed,
and the attempts of grovelling speculators
to forestall the market and make money out
of the life-blood of our defonders, have so
much influenced the withdrawal from sale
of the surplus in the hands of the producers,
that the Government has been unable
to gather full supplies. Tho Secretary of
War has prepared a plan, which is appended
to this address, by the aid of which, or
some similar means to be adopted by your­

Beives, you can assist tno omcers or tne J
Government in tho purchase of the bacon,
the pork and the beef, known to exist in
large quantities in different parts of the
country. Even if the surplus be less than
is believed, is it not a bitter and humiliating
reflection that those who remain at
home, secure from hardship and protected
from danger, should be in the enjoyment of
abundance, and that their slaves also should
have a full supply of food, while their sons,
brothers, husbands and fathers are stinted
in the rations on which their health and
efficiency depend ?
Entertaining no fear that you will either
misconstrue the motive of this address, or
fail to respond to the call of patriotism, I
have plaoed the facts fully and frankly before
you. Let us all unite in the performance
of our duty, eaoh in his sphere; and,
with concerted, persistent and well directed
effort, there seems little reason to donbt
that, under the blessings of Him to whom
we look for guidance, and who has been to s
us our shield and our strength, we shall *
maintain the sovereignty and independence
of these Confederate States, and transmit c
to our posterity the heritage bequeathed to 1
us by our fathers.

Executive Office, Riohmond, April t

IV, 1806. j
Plan Suggested by the Secretary of War.
I. Let the people in each county, parish t
or ward select at public meeting, as early as
convenient, a committee of three or more j
discreet citizens, charged with the duties t
hereinafter mentioned.
II. Let it be the duty of this committee ^
to ascertain from each citizen in the county
or parish what amount of surplus meat,
whether bacoo, pork or beef, he can spare p
for the use of the army, after reserving a
supply for his family and those dependent Is
on him for food. t
Let this committe fix a prioe which is j
deemed by them a just compensation for t
the articles furnished, and inform the citi- r
zens what this price is, so that each may c
know, before delivery, what price is to be h
paid for tho articles furnished. d
Let this committe make arrangements for
the transportation of the supplies to some d
convenient depot, after consultation with c
;he officer who is to.receive them. a
Let the committee make delivery of the n
supplies aDd receiving payment of the price, d

ind assume the duty of paying it over to
ihe citizens who have furnished the supplies.
III. Where the duty of the committee
is performed in any town or city at which
there may be a Quartermaster or Commissary,
no further duty need be required of
them than to deliver to the offioer a list of
names of the citizens and of the supplies
which each is ready to furnish, and the
price fixed; whereupon the officer will himself
gather the supplies and make payment.
IV. Where the supplies are furnished in
the country, the oost of transportation to
the depot will be paid by the Government,
in addition to the price fixed by the committee.
V. As this appeal is made to the people
for the benefit of our brave defenders now
in the army, the Department relies with
confidence on the patriotism of the people
that no more than iust comoensation would

be fixed by the committees, nor accepted
by those whose chief motive will be to aid
their country, and not to make undue gains
out of the needs of our noble soldiers.

WASHINGTON, April 5.-Secretary Carlisle
has written the following letter on the sub­
ject of his candidacy for the presidential nom­
ination at the Chicago convention:

. Charles .R. Long, Esq., Chairman Demo-
cratic State Central Committee, Louisville:
I Your favor of March 30, in which you say
in substance that many of my friends in Ken-
tucky and -elsewhere desire me to become a
candidate before the approaching national
, Democratic convention for the nomination for
the office of president, and requesting me to
give, ""some authoritative or definite expres­
sion"" upon the subject, was duly received,
and has been maturely considered. Many
communications upon the same subject and
of similar import have been received from
friends in different parts of the country, and
while very grateful for these numerous ex-
pressions of confidence and esteem upon the
part of my Democratic fellow citizens. I
have not been able to reach the conclusion
that the existing conditions require me to
comply with their requests by authorizing
them to announce me as a candidate for the
presidential nomination. While I feel a pro-
found interest in the welfare of my party, I
am much more concerned about its declara­
tion of principles than in its selection of can-
didates, because, in my opinion,"" its failure
or success at the election, as well as' Its ca­
pacity for useful service In the country in
the future, depend upon the position it takes
or omits to take upon the public questions
now engaging the attention of the people, and
especially the questions affecting the mone­
tary system of the country and the character
and amount of taxation to be imposed upon
our citizens. Its position upon these and oth­
er subjects having been agreeed upon and
clearly and distinctly announced, the conven­
tion ought to have no difficulty in selecting an
acceptable candidate who will fairly repre-
sent Its views; and, in order that its delibera­
tions may be embarrassed as little as possi­
ble by the contentions of rival aspirants and
their friends, I think my duty to the party
will be best performed by declining to parti-
cipate in a contest for the nomination. The
obligations assumed when I accepted my
present official position require me to devote
my entire time and attention to the public
interests committed to my charge, and I shall
I continue to discharge the duties imposed upon
me to the best of my ability, and in such
manner as will, ln my Judgment, most cer­
tainly promote the true interests of the coun-
try; and, if, in the opinion of | my fellow
Democrats in | Kentucky, my services entitle
me to "" their \ commendation and approval, I.
would regard 'their indorsement of my public
course as an ample reward for -the little I
have been able to accomplish in behalf of
honest administration and a sound financial
policy. With many thanks for your kind
letter, I am, very truly,
—J. G. Carlisle. !

LOUISVILLE, April The Courier-Jour-
nal will tomorrow publish the following cdi-
torial on the letter of Secretary Carlisle, made
public tonight: i
■ The position which Mr. Carlisle takes is one
entirely in accord with the dignity of the
office of president, and- with the duties of the
office of secretary of the treasury. He de-
clines to participate in a contest for a nor­
n holding that the matter of first mo-
ment is the declaration of the party's princi­
ples. He desires the indorsement of his
services by his state, and though he does not
say so in bo many words, if his state shall
present his name to the national convention,
on a satisfactory"" platform, he will undoubt­
edly accept that responsibility.
This is a matter of exceptional moment at
once to the Democratic party, and to the en»
tire people of the United States. To the Dem-
ocartic party Is brings squarely home the
issue whether it is to continue to be the
party of Jefferson, Jackson, Benton and
Cleveland, or whether it is to set up strange
gods and lend the , priceless prestige of its
name and history to an alien faith.
. To the people of the United States it is of
vital concern, for, upon the decision within
the Democratic party of the issue thus forced
upon it depends the one possibility that this
country shall have a presidential candidate,
backed by the organized resources of either
of the two great political parties, a man with
a universally conceded clear comprehension
of the nature and necessities of a sound
monetary system as indispensable to the
protection of national integrity and material
prosperity, and with a record,- not of pro-
fession but of performance. In itself at this
time the only unimpeachable proof of prac­
tical, unswerving and unassailable fidelity to
the principles of such a system. Kentucky
is ready. It needs no campaign to bring Ken-
tucky to Carlisle. Let the convention be
called— sooner the better—and the state
which took the lead for an honest tariff will
take the lead for an honest currency.

HUNTER SEEKS , REVENGE.
He Has a Knife With Which to
Puncture Bradley's Boom.
FRANKFORT, Ky., April There will be
a contest between the friends of Gov. Brad­
ley and Congressman Hunter at the Repub­
lican state convention in Louisville, April 15.
Hunter was manager of the campaign when
Bradley was elected governor last year, and
charges the governor with ingratitude during
the past winter in not helping Hunter in his
senatorial contest. | Hunter is now a candi­
date for renomlnation for congress and for
delegate at large to the St. Louis convention.
Hunter is a pronounced McKinley man and
it is charged at the state house that he
would not follow instructions for Bradley if
the . state convention adopts Bradley resolu­
tions. While the friends of Gov. Bradley are
said to be opposing Hunter'for congress as
well as for delegate to St. Louis, the friends
of Hunter are said to be working for the
adoption of McKinley resolutions in the coun­
ty and district conventions, and that the
final test of strength will come at the state
convention. "" , '

UNITED STATES
AND JAPAN.

The New Treaty Between the Two
Countries in Effect To-Day.

An Event of Far Reaching Importance to

Both the Powers Interested.

Does Away With Treaty Methods
Which Have Been in Vogue For
the Past Half Century, and Sub­
stitutes an Entirely New School
of Procedure.

WASHINGTON, July 16.—A new­
treaty between the United States and
Japan goes into effect to-morrow, at
which time also new treaties between
Japan and nearly all of the countries
of Europe and some of the South Amer­
ican republic also go into effect. It
is an event of far-reaching importance
in the relations between Japan and
the United States, as it does away with
the treaty methods which have been in
vogue for nearly fifty years, and sub­
stitutes an entirely new school of pro­
cedure. The same is true in the rela­
tions of Japan with other countries.
Taken as a whole, the many new trea­
ties which go into effect to-morrow will
place Japan on an entirely uifferent
footing with the world at large, as she
is recognized for the first time as an
equal in every respect. The treaty with
this country was made November 22,
1894, in Washington, between Secretary
Gresham and Minister Kureno, who
then represented Japan here. The
changes it made were so far-reaching
that it was determined the treaty
should not go into operation until July
17, 1899.
Jutardo Komura, the present Japan­
ese Minister in Washington, was seen
at the Japanese Legation to-day, and
gave an interesting outline of the more
important features of this arrangement.
He said: ""The 17th of July marks the
turning point in diplomatic history, not
only of Japan, but of the Oriental coun­
tries in general. It will be the first in­
stance in which the Western Powers
have recognized the full sovereignty of
an Oriental State. This action of the
enlightened nations of Europe and
America shows that if any country is
ready to assume a full share in the
responsibility and affairs of the world
at large, these old and enlightened
Powers are ready to admit such a
country to full comity among nations
So we regard the advent of this treaty
as a very important step not only fo?
Japan, but for all the nations of the
East.
""The countries with which Japan has
made new treaties are the United
States, Russia. Great Britain, Germany,""
France, Austria, Italy, Spain, Portugal,
Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Sweden
and Norway, Switzerland and Peru. All
these go into effect to-morrow, except
those with France and Austria, which
are' deferred until August 4th. With
most of these countries Japan had
treaty relations before, but they were
crude and unsatisfactory.
""To understand the change it is
necessary to look at the system un­
der the old treaties. This w-as essen­
tially based on two principles:
""First, that foreign residents in Japan
shall enjoy the privileges of extra-ter­
ritoriality; that is, they should be
amenable to the laws and jurisdiction
of the Consul of their country, and not
to Japanese jurisdiction; and», second,
that foreign residents in Japan shall
be confined to certain open ports, out­
side of which foreigners could not re­
side, own property or engage in trade.
The result was in effect that about fif­
teen or sixteen systems of courts in
Japan, for the purpose of trying foreig­
ers who committed offenses in Japan.

Furthermore, most of the Powers :
claimed that Japanese laws were not
binding upon foreigners. For instance,
take our quarantine law. While it pro­
tected-us against our own people, yet
there was no protection in the case of
an infected foreign ship. The only *x­
ception to this refusal to recognize
Japanese law was the United States,
which recognized from the first the
binding force of the Japanese law.
""One of the bad effects of this system
was that foreign residents had entire
immunity from taxation. The Japan­
ese paid all the taxes. All this has
disappeared, and foreigners have the
same privileges as well as the same
obligations as the Japanese citizens, no
more and no less. The first step in
the new system is to put an end to the j
old fiction of extra-territoriality. by I
which foreign citizens were judged by i
different standards from Japanese.

""The second essential thing is the j
opening of the entire interior of Japan
to foreign residents and trade. Until
now there have been only five treaty
ports—Yokohama, Nagasaki, Kobe,
Hakodate and Nigata. In those places
foreigners had been able to live, to j
purchase property and to trade, but
outside of this they could not even j
travel without a special permit. These |
five places are an insignificant part of !
Japan. Hencfefore the entire interiot i
of the empire, with its populous cities 1
and inviting fields of industry, is
thrown open to foreigners. They may 1
live anywhere, engage In any kind of
business, and will be assured of thfc
same protection to life and property
that is given to the Japanese.

""In bringing about the new system of |
treaties, Japan naturally feels most
friendly toward the United States, be- I
cause she always has shown a most i
sympathetic interest in Japan's desire '
to adopt modern methods and to deal
on even terms with the rest of the
world. The messages of several of the
Presidents have spoken in most friendly
terms of this matter. And so, as the

Government and people of the United
States have taken such a friendly in­
terest under the old system, I hope and
believe the United States Go»»rnment
and people will take a most friendiy
interest in the carrying out of the new
treaty.""

"298","633009","the objects herein suggested without contracting the circulation, some other form of paper money must be allowed to fill the vacuum which would otherwise be occasioned. The National bank note now familiar to our pepple is the readiest and most practical agent to accomplish that object, and under reasonable conditions it vill be found responsive to the call.
                 An enlarged issue of bank notes thus contemplated would require a number of amendments to the present National Bank Act. These amendments should be made only upon such conservative lines as would, while granting the necessary aid to the business world in facilitating exchanges, in nowise weaken the system, or lessen the stability of the notes to be issued. The complaint uttered against the National Bank Act as it now stands is not directed toward the method of bank organization or the absolute safety guaranteed to the note holder. It is directed towar(i those restrictions it embodies, which result In its failure to accomplish the full benefit it ought to carry. The requirement of the law now makes it impossible to organize a bank with a capital of less than 850,000, no matter  small the place in which it is to be located, or how restricted the volume of business there to be transacted. Because of that, with the added expense of taxation, both national and local, many communities are deprived of the aid of banks of issue and burdened with onerous rates of exchange and Interest charges.
                 In order to obviate to as great tn extent as possible those objections and make the Act more harmonious with proper business conditions, I recommend that it be amended in the following particulars:
                 First. Permit National banks to be organized with a minimum capital of $25,000 in any place having a population of 2,000 inhabitants or less.
                 Second. Reduce the rate of taxation on circulating notes secured by deposit of bonds to one-half of 1 per cent, per annum.
                 Third. Permit banks now organized or hereafter organized to issue circulating notes to the par value of the refunding bonds  suggested, when deposited by them with the Treasurer of the United States; and, further, allow such banks as shall avail themselves of the opportunity to deposit its security with the Treasury of the United States greenbacks, Treasury notes, or silver certificates to a total amount of 8200.000,000. against which there shall at once be issued to them by the Comptroller of the Currency National bank notes to an equal amount, it being further provided that from time to time, at his convenience, the Secretary of
                 the Treasury shall substitute for the greenbacks, Treasury notes and  so deposited to secure circulation, bonds of the same class and character as the refunding bonds first named to the amount of $200,000,000, such bonds to be chargeable to said banks and by them accounted for at such price (not less than par) as the market quotations may indicate to be their fair market value. During the period of time intervening between the deposit of greenbacks. Treasury notes and silver certificates and the substitution of the bonds by the Secretary of the Treasury, the circulating notes specifically issued therefor shall be exempt from taxation. Upon such substitution of bonds the funds released thereby shall at once be transferred by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Issue and Redemption Division.
                 Fourth. After said banks have deposited such bonds, greenbacks, Treasury notes, or silver certificates to the amount of 50 per cent. of their capital they shall be permitted to issue bank notes in addition to the 50 per cent. thus provided, to the extent of 25 per cent. of such deposit, which said 25 per cent. may be unsecured by any direct pledge of security but issued against the assets of the bank.
                 Fifth. Extend the guaranty of payment by the Government to all circulating notes of the bank whether Issued against deposited security or against assets.
                 Sixth. To secure the Government against loss, if any, attaching to its guaranty a tax of 2 per cent. per annum on unsecured circulation shall be levied to create a safety fund, which fund shall be invested by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency in Government bonds. In addition to such funds the Government shall be further protected by having a first lien upon all assets in case of failure of the issuing bank.
                 Seventh. All notes shall be redeemed in the City of New York at the sub-Treasury, and at such other sub-Treasuriesasmaybedesignated by the Comptrollerof the Currency with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, The control of such redemption shall be under the direction of the Comptroller of the Currency and made from a redemption fund of 10 per cent., t u be provided and maintained by the banks.
                 Eighth. Restrict the issue of National bank notes to the denomination of $10 and upward.
                 WOULD AFFORD RELIEF TO THE SOUTH AND NVEST.
                 An examination of the plan herein proposed will show that the amendments suggested are not of a distinctly radical character. It is believed that banks organized under the National Bank Act, with these amendments, would give upon a thoroughly safe basis a desirable credit currency leading ultimately to further freedom of issue as the result of time and experience. A careful investigation of the commercial conditions of the country at different periods of the year shows bow essential to those sections depending upon the prompt moving of the staple crops of cotton, wheat, and corn is a bank-note issue which enables the local bank to supply ,its customers with the means necessary for such purpose within the shortest period of time and at the lowest cost. In illustration of this point attention is called to the extent to which the crop-producing sections of the country are now dependent as borrowers of money upon other sections.
                 The National banks located in the Southern States have an aggregate capital of $68,680,000. On October 6, 1896, they had borrowed largely from banks in the East, to assist in handling the cotton crop, $18,548,000. On larch 9 following these loans had been reduced to $2,516,200. They succeeded in borrowing for a part of their needs, but commercial necessities required more. With proper banking facilities the necessity of such borrowing now existing would be reduced to a minimum.
                 I am confident that under an Act allowing a greater liberality of issue, and less burdensome rates of taxation, those banks would find it to their interest to issue,
                 instead of $18,950,000, the amount which they have at present outstanding, a sum equal to the full amount of their capital, and, in addition, in the season of crop activity, an additional unsecured volume of circulation approximating 25 per cent. of their capital.

Washington, Dec. 6.—The annual
report of Attorney General Garland,
was transmitted to congress to-day. It
gives a full account of the business of
the department of justice during the
last fiscal year, together with statistics
of crime against the United States. Th 3
number of ordinary suits now pending
in the court of claims is 1,110, involving
the sum of .14,250,000. The number of
cases filed under the Bowman act is
1,819, involving about .50,000,000. The
petitions filed in the French spoliation
cases number 5,500, representing 2,48*5
vessels and about r_0,000,000. The
mo unt reported in favor of claimants
in eighty-one of these cases passed upon
is about $-25,000, varying in sums from
.06 to 145,318. During the last fiscal
year 1,..7 civil suits were
terminated. In '*__ of these judgments
were for the United States, in 102 for
the defendants, and 704 were either nol
prossed, dismissed or discontinued: 20
were appealed from the district to the
circuit court, and 24 from the circuit
court to the supreme court. There
were pending July 1 4,054 civil suits in
'which the United States was a party.
During the year there were 12,0.)**
..criminal prosecutions, mostly for viola­
tion of customs and internal revenue
laws. The aggregate amount of judg­
ments rendered in favor of the United
States in civil suits during the last year
was $1,051,250, and the amount
actually collected on these judgments
was .152,558, while $li*,'*7_ was ob­
tained during the year on judgments

The Spaniards, on the other hand, declare that the struggle will last for three years, and that they will tight to the last. Senor Stfgasta (Prime Minbter of Spain), in the course of an address to his supporters preparatory to the opening of the Cortes, passionately protested against the infamous aspersions which had been east on Spanish honour by the United States.

'"" suggest we wait until sugar stock goes up a little higher,"" said Mr. Bailey,
sarcastically. ""It has gone up $0 a lSare
since the agreement was reported.""
All efforts to reach an agreement hav­
ing failed, Mr. Dingley opened his speech
on the conference report. He took up
each schedule, explaining In ditall the
changes made, and following closely the
formal statement given out by the om,
mlttee.
Concerning the sugar schedule, Mr.
DingJoy read from the ofile'al statement,
adding brief comments. By the new ar­
rangement about $6,000,000 increase of
revenue would be realized, as the increase
had been placed on raw sugars at the
point where revenue would be received,
and at the same time the beet sugar in­
dustry would receive substantial benefit.
When Mr. Dingley referred to the elim­
Ination of the stamp tax, Mr. Todd (Dem.)
of Michigan asked him if he then ""con­
fessed"" that they had abandoned the idea
of taxing the stock gamblers of Wall
street.
""Not at all,"" replied Mr. Dingley.
""We discovered that the sales on Wall
street could not be followed. No record is
kept. The machinery of collection would
be too complex.""
Mr. Cooper (Rep.) of Wisconsin wanted
an explanation of the net result of the
change In the sugar schedule.
Mr. Dingley's Explanations.
Mr. Dingley explained It along the lines
of the statement submitted by the con­
ferecs. The differential to the refiner, he
said, was exactly the same as the house
bill. This started a volley of questions
about the sugar schedule.
Mr. Johnson (Rep.) of Indiana wanted
to know if the increase in the rate on re.
tined sugar would not increase the profits
of the trust in anticipatory importations
of raw sugars,.
Mr. Dingley explained the impossibility
of preventing these profits.
Mr. Dingley, after a calculation, af­
firmed that the refiner of sugar under the
present Wilson law had a differential of
223 cents per hundred pounds, as against
123 cents in the pending bill, as agreed to
by the conferees
Revenue to Be Raised.
As to the question of revenue to be
raised by the bill, Mr. Dingley pointed
out the difficulty resulting from the large
antclpatory importations. The bill next
year, he calculated, would raise $225,000,­
O000-4$75,000,000 more than the present
law. Over $40,000,000 had been lost In this
year's revenues by the importations of
wool and sugar and other things, the duty
on which was raised in the bill, so that
he calculated that the bill this year would
raise $1f,.000,000. Mr. Dingley declared
that there was no doubt that the rev­
enue would not only be ample to meet
the expenditures of the government, but
allow a Republican'adminlstratlon to be­
gin again to pay off the principal of the
debt which had been increased by the
late administration. In conclusion Mr.
Dingley received round after round of ap­
plause from his Republican colleagues, by
predicting as a result of this bill a rise
of prices and a restoration of prosperity.
Most Vicious and Burdensome.
Mr.VWheeler (Dem.) of Alabama opened
the debate for the Democrats, criticising
the bill as the most vicious and burden­
some ever imposed on the American peo­
pie. In particular he discussed the seri­
ous effect of the measure on the laborers
and agriculturists. Mr. Wheeler re­
ferred to the advance in Sugar stock on
tthe New York market to-day and said
this was the clearest evidence of the bene­
fits conferred on the sugar trust.
Mr. Swanson (Dem.) of Virginia, a
member of the ways and means commit­
tee, to whom Mr. Wheeler yielded a por­
Stlion
of his time, devoted his attention to
assailing the sugar schedule agreed upon
by the conferees.
He asserted that the proposed schedule
gave sugar double the protection received
under the present law. and it had been
loudly proclaimed. Mr. Swanson said, that
the house conferees had won a brilliant
victory over the senate on sugar and he
had seen In the morning papers a picture
of the speaker of the house with the sugar
trust crushed beneath his feet.
He then compared the two schedules to
show that the duty on refined sugar in
- the senate schedule and the new schedule
were exactly the same, and he igured out
that the trust would receive a dlfferential
on refined sugars of 02 degrees (the aver­
ago of sugars imported) of 4 cents per
c schedule.
Advance in Sugar Stock.
""We might be mistaken here,"" con­
tinued Mr. Swanson, ""we might not be
able to figure out the complicated sched­ ule, but there are those who make no
eistake. They are' the holders of the
trust's stock. They know the effect of
the intricacies of this schedule. When
this bill was reported to congress, Sugar
stock was worth $108 a share. To-day it
is worth $144. The stock has gone up
$36 a share since it became evident that
this house and this congress intended to
agive this gratuity to the trust (Demo­
mrati appause and since the -
pictures have appeared portraying the
speaker with his heel on the throat of
the trust, the stock has gone up $II a
share -irenwedDem ocratlo applDause).
One more such victory as this, gentle­
_Xlen, and the .stock will go up, to $200.""
(Laughter.)
Proflts of the Trust.
Mr. Lacey (Rep.) of Iowa asked Mr.
Swanson whether the trust had not made
great profits. in 1804 by anticipating Im­
portations, just as the trust probably
would make great profits now. Their
profits were estimated at $15,000,000.
Might not this account for the increased
value of the stock? he asked.
If the trust were to make $15,000,000 out
of anticipating importations, Mr. Swanson
replied, it was not entitled to a differen­
tial.
""We cannot prevent anticipating impor­
tations,"" said Mr. Lacey.
""You could do what Secretary Gage re­
commends,"" replied Mr. Swanson. ""You
could place an internal revenue tax on the
sugar which has been imported. If you
want to strike a blow at the trust, why
don't you follow the advice of your secre­
tary of the treasury?""
Mr. Swanson and Mr. Northway (Rep.)
of Ohio then had a brief controversy on
the sudden bulge in the price of Sugar
stocks, in which the latter contended that
Sugar stocks had gore up in sympathy
with the whole market.
Tribute to William J. Bryan.
One of the greatest demonstrations of
the debate occurred when Mr. Lanham
(DMm.) of Texas, who followed, paid a
tribute to William J. Bryan. The Demo­
crats cheered for several minutes and
many of the spectators Joined in the de­
monstration.
Mr. Ball (Dem.) of Texas, who secured
a few minutes time, declared that it was
not un-Democratic to advocate the rais­
Ing of revenue by duties on wool, sugar,
lumber, etc., but he denounced the Demo*
crats who sought protection for the int
dustrles for their sections.

officer of the United States has appearod,auner
orders, at any plhce of election,' iti-any Sttoe;
no complaint even of the presence of the
United States troops has been made in any
quarter. It may therefore be confidently
stated there is no necessity for the enactment
of section 6 of the bill before me to prevent
military interferenceo at elcctions. The laws
already in force are all thait is required for
that end, but that part of section 6 of
this bill which is significant and vitally
important, is the clause
, which, if
adopted,. will deprive the civil, authori­
ties of the United States of all power to
keep the peace at Congressional elections.
Congressional elections in every district in a
very important sense are justly a matter of
political interest and concern throughout the
whole country. In each State every political
party is entitled to tile sllare of power which is
conferred by legal and constitutional suffrage.
It is the right of every citizen possessing the
qualification prescribed by law to cast an un­
intimiuated ballot and to have his ballot justly
counted. So long as the exercise of this power
and enjoyment of this right, are commnon and
equal practically, as well as formally, submis­
sion to suffrage will be accorded loyally and
cheerfully, ant the departments of the Govern­
ment will feel te true vigor of the popular will
thus expresse(. Two provisions of the Consti­
tution authorize legislation by Congress for the
regulation of Congressional elections.
Section 4 of ar _cle 1 of the Constitution de­
clares ""the times, places and manner of hold=
ing elections for Senators and Representatives
shall be prescribed in each State by the Legis.
lature thereof, but Congress may at any tithe,
by law, make or alter such regulations except
as to the places of choosing Senators.""
Thi fifteenth amendment of the Constitution
is as follows:
""Sec. 1. The right of citizncus of the United
States to vote shall not be denied or abridged
by the Uiited States or by atty State. on ac­
count of race, color or previous condition of
servitude.
""See. 2. The Congress shall have power to
enforce this article by appropriate legisla­
tion.""'
The Supreme Court has held that this amend­
ment invests citizens of the United States with
it new constitutional rirlht, which is within the
protecting power of Congress. That right the
Constitution declares to be exemption from
discriminationin the exercise of the elective
franchise on account of race, color, or previous
condition of servitude. The power of Congress
to protect this right by appropriate legishition
is expressly aflirmed by the Court.
National legislation to provide safeguards
for free and honest elections is necessary, as
experience has shown, not only to secure the
right to vote to the enfranchised race at the
South, but also to prevent fraudulent voting in
the large cities of thteNorth.
Congress has, therefore, exercised the power
conferred by the Constitution, and has enacted
certain laws to prevent discrimination on ac­
count of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude and to punish fraud, violence anild
intimidation at Federal elections.
Attention is called to the following sections
of the revised' statutes of the United
States, viz: Section 2004, which guarantees
all citizens the right to vote without
distinction on account of race, color
or previous condition of servitude.
Sections 2,005 and 2,006, which
guarantee to all citizens equal opportunity
without discrimination to perform all acts re­
garded by law as prerequisite or qualification
tor voting. Section 2022, which authorizes the
United States PMarsmhal and his Deputies to keep
the peace and preserve order at a Federal
election. Section 2,024, which expressly anu­
thorizes the United States Marshal and his
Deputies to summon a posse cornitatus when­
ever they, or any of them, are forcibly resisted
in the execution of their duties under the law
and are prevented from executing their duties
by violence. Section 5,522, which provides for
the punishment of the crime of interfering
with the Supervisors of Election and the
Deputy Marshals in the discharge of their
duties at the elections of Representatives in
Congress.
THESE ARE SOME OF TIIE LAWS
on this subject wiich it Is the duty of the Ex­
ecutive Department of the Government to en­
force.
Tile intent and effect of the 6th section of this
bill are to prohibit all civil oticersof the United
States, under the penalty of fine anu imprison­
ment, from employing any adequate civil force
for this purpose, at a place where their en­
forceiuent is most necessary, ' namely; at the
polls where Congressional elections are lneld.
Among the most valuable enactments to
which I have referred are those whicl protect
the Supervisors of Federal elections in the
discharge of their duties at the polls.
If the pending legislation should become law,
there is no power vested in any ofilcer of the
Government to protect from violence the.otll­
cers of the United States engaged in the dis­
charge of their duties. Their rights and
duties under the law will remain, but the Na­
tional Government will be powerless to enforce
its own statutes. The States may employ both
the military and civil power to keep the peace
and to enforce the laws at State elections. It
is nowiproposed to deny to the United States
the neceossary civil authority to protect na­
tional elections. No sufficient reason has been
given for this discrimination in favor of the
State and against national authority. If well­
founoea o )ecnions exist ug#lnst, tue present
national election laws, all good citizens would
unite in their ameudment. Laws providing
safeguards of.elections should be impartial,
just and eiclent; they should, If possible, be
so non-partisan and fair in their operation that
the minority l)arty out of power will have no
jus~t groutnds .to complain. Tlhe present
laws have in practte unquestionably conduced
to thel prevention of frantl and violence at elec­
tions, audin several of theStates members of
different political parties have aplplied for tihe
safeguards which they furnish. It is the right
and duty of tihe National Governtent to enact
and enforce laws which will secure tree and
fail Congressional electiots. Tihe laws now in
foterce should not be repealed, except in connec­
tion with the enactmenmt of a nmeasuro which
will better accompllish that imnportant culd.

MR. LINCOLN'S REPLY.
Executive Mansion, Washington,
0N,
June 12, 1863
Hon. Erastus Corning and others :
Gentlemen : Your letter of May 19, in­
closing the resolutions of a public meeting
held at Albany, New York, on the 16th of t'to
same month, was received several days ago.
The resolutions, as I understand them, are
resolvable into two propositions first, the
expression of a purpose to sustain the cause
of the Union, to secure peace through victo­
ry, and to support the Administration in every
constitutional and lawful measure to suppress
the Rebellion; and secondly, a declaration of
censure upon the Administration for supposed
unconstitutional action, such as the making of
military arrests. And, from the two propo­
sitions a third is deduced, which is that the
gentlemen comprising the meeting are resolv­
ed on doing their part to maintain our com­
mon government and country, despite the
folly or wickedness, as they may conceive, f
any Administration. This position is emi­
nently patriotic, and as such I thank the
meeting and congratulate the nation for it.
My own purpose is the same ; so that the
meeting and myself have a common object,
and can have no difference, except in the
choice of means or measures for effecting that
object.
And here I ought to close this papor, and
would close it, if there were no apprehension
that more injurious consequences than any
merely personal to myself might follow the
censures systematically cast upon me for do­
ing what, in my view of duty, I could not
forbear. The resolutions promise to support
me in every constitutional and lawful meas­
ure to suppress the Rebellion; and I have not
knowingly employed, nor shall knowingly
employ, any other. But the meeting, by
their resolution, assert and argue that certain
military arrests, and proceedings following
them, for which I am ultimately responsible,
are unconstitutional. I think they are not.
The resolutions quote from the Constitution
the definition of treason, and also the limiting
safeguards and guarantees therein provided
for the citizen on trials for treason, aud on his
being held to answer for capital and otherwise
infamous crimes, and.in criminal j. rosecutions,
his right to a speedy and public trial by an
impartial jury. Thoy proceed to resolve

citizen agaiuat the preteueioue of arbitrary

secured substantially to the English people f bellion, do not proceed altogether upon the
nfte' years of protracted civil war, and were j inie basis. The former is directed at the
adopted into our Constitution at the close of small per centnge of ordinary and continuous
the Revolution."" Would not the d.-monstra- perpetration of crime; while the latter is di­
tion have been better if it could have been j rerred at sudden and extensive uprisings
truly said that these safeguards had been against the Government, which at most, will

cumstances which show that, while they con­
stitute the foundation of all free government,
they ae the elements of the'enduring stabili­

they have so stood the test up to the begin­
ning of the present Rebellion, if we ei'cept a
certain occurrence at New Orleans ; nor does

any one question that they will stand the committed, may be illustrated by a few nota­

Ours is a case of robellion so called bv

flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion ; and
the provision of the Constitution that "" the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall
not be suspended, unless when, in cases of re-

quire it,"" is tlte provision which specially

applies to our present case. This provision ! in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public

preventive and less for the vindictive than
tbe former. In such cases, the purposes of
men are much more easily understood than
in cases of ordinary crimes. The man who

Every one of them, if arrested, would have

and similar cases, I think the time not unlike­

cate their opinion that military arrests may
be constitutional in localities where rebelliou
actually exists,but that such arrests are uncon-

makes no such distinction. I am unable to lw-
lieve that there is any such constitutional dis-

i in cases of rebellion or invasion, the. mihlin

such cases they ae constitutional wherever the
public safety does require them; as well in
places to which they may prevent the Rebel­
liou extending as in those where it may be al­
ready prevailing; as well where they may re­
strain mischievous interference with the rais-
i InS an(1 supplying of armies to suppress the
would prevent mutiny in the army ; equally
constitutional at all places where they will
j conduce to the public safety, as against the
! danger of rebellion or invasion. Take the
I particular case mentioned bv the meeting. It
is asserted, in substance, that Mr. Vallandig­
liam was, by a military commander, seized
and tried "" for no other reason than words ad­
dressed to a public meeting, in criticism of the
course of the Administration, and in condem
nation of the Military orders of the General,""
Now, if there bo no mistake about this; if this
assertion is the truth and the .whole truth; if
there was no other reason for the arrest, then
I concede that the arrest was w rong. But the
arrest, as I understand, was made for a very
different reason. Mr. Vallandigham avows
his hostility to the War on the part of the Un­
ion; and his arrest was made because he was
the political prospects of the Administration,
or the personal interests of the Commanding
General, but because he was damaging the ar-
my, upon the existence and vigor of which
the life of the Nation depends. He was war-
j ring upon the Military, and this gave the
Military constitutional jurisdiction to lay
hands upon him. If Mr. Valhndigham was
not damaging the military power of thecoun-
try, then his arrest was made on mistake of
fact, which I would be glad to correct on rea-
sonably satisfactory evidence.
I understand the meeting, whose resolu-
tions I am considering, to be in favor of sun-
pressing the Rebellion by military force by
armies. Long experience has shown that ar-
mies cannot be maintained unless desertions
shall be punished by the severe penalty of
death. The case-requires, and the law and

Thjs UOne the less injurious when effected
by getting a father, or brother, or friend, into

dier boy that he is fighting in a bad cause, for

' Government, too weak to arrest and punish

j a case -to silence the agitator and save the boy
j is 1H)t only constitutional, but withal a great
mercy.
I If I be wrong on this question of consti-
tutional power, my error lies in believing that
certain proceedings are constitutional when,
be persuaded that the Government can consti
tutionally take no strong measures in time of
rebellion, because it can l.e shown that the :

In yiviirg the r esolutions tht earnest con­

overlook 'he fact that the meeting speak as

for their , known intelligence, and the fairly
presumed deliberation with which they pre­
pared their resolutions, be permitted to tup-
; pose that this occurred by accident, or in cny
1 other way than that they preferred to desig­
nate themselves ""Democrats"" rather than

such more elevated nositioiu we could do
j better battle for the country we all love than
; we possibly can from those lower ones where,
j from the force of habit, the prejudices of the
past, and selfish hopes of the future, we aro
; sure to expend much of our ingenuity and
strength in finding fault with, and aiming
blows at each other. But, since you have
denied me this, I will yet be thankful, for the
country's sake, that not all Democrats have
done so. He on whose discretionary judg­
ment Mr. V allandigham was arrested and
tried is a Democrat, having no old party af­
finity with me; and the judge who rejected
; the constitutional view expressed in these
; resolutions, by refusing to discharge Mr. Val­
: landigham on habeas corpus, is a Democrat of
j better days than these, having received his
: judicial maut'e at -the. hands, of President
Jackson. And still more, of all those Demo-
crats who are nobly exposing their lives and
I shedding their blood on the battle-field,! have
learned that many approved the course taken
with Mr. Vallingham, while I have not heard
of a single one condemning it. I cannot as-
sert that there are none such. And the name

of President Jackson recalls an instance of
pertinent history: After the battle of New
Orleans, and while tjie fact Unit the treaty of
peace had been concluded was well known in
the -city, but before official knowledge of it
had arrived, Gen. Jackson still maintajj-rtSr
martial or military lr.w. Now, tha; it could
be said the war was over, the clamor against
martial law, which had existed fron .i the first,
grew more furious. Among other, things, a
Mr. Louiallier published a denunciatory news­
paper article. Gen. Jackson arretted him. A
lawyer by the name of Morel j procured the
United States Jndge to issue a writ of habeas

, corpus to relieve Mr. Louialtiea"". Gen. Jack
son arrested both the lawyer and the judge.
A Mr. 1 ollander ventured to say of some
part of the matter that "" it was a dirty trick.""
Gen. Jackson arrested him. When the orS-
j cer undertook to serve the writ of habeas
j corpus, Gen. Jackson took it from him, and
) sent him away with a copy. Holding the
; judge in custody a few days, the Generel sent
j him beyond the limits of his encampment,
j and set him at liberty, with an order to re­
i main till the ratification of peace should be
j regularly announced, or until the British
; should have left the Southern coast. A day
I or two more elapsed, the ratification of a
j treaty of peace was regularly announced, and
j the judge and others were fully liberated. A
j few days more, and the judge crtlled General
; Jackson into court and fined him $1,000 for
having arrested him and the others named.
The General paid the fine, and there the
matter rested for nearly thirty years, when
; Congress refunded principal and interest.
j The late Senator Douglas, then in the House
j of Representatives, took a leading part in the
i debates, in which the constitutional question
j was much discussed. I am not prepared to
say whom the journals would show voted for
the measure.
It may be remarked : First, that we had
the same Constitution then as now; secondly,
that we. then had a case of invasion, and now
we have a case of rebellion; and, thirdly, that
the permanent right of the People to Public
i Discussion, the Liberty of Speech and of the
: Press, the Trial by Jury, the Law of Evi­
dence, and the Habeas Corpus, suffered no
j detriment whatever by that conduct of Gen.
Jackson, or its subsequent approval by the
I American Congress.
And yet, let me say that, in my own dis-
, cretion, I do not kuow whether I would havo
j ordered ihe arrest of Mr. Vallandigham.
' While I cannot shift the responsibility from
1 myself, I hold that, as a general rule, the
1 commander in the field is the better j udge of

! I must practice a general directory and revis-
ory power in the matter.

progresses, it appears to me, opinion and ac­
tion, which were in great confusion at first,
take shape and fall into more regular chan-
! nels, so that the necessity for strong dealing
! with them gradually decreases. I have every
' reason to desire that it should cease altogeth-
er; and far from the least is my regard for the
i opinions and wishes of those who, like the
meeting at Albany, declare tbeir purpose to
sustain the Government in every Consritu-
1 tional and lawful measure to suppress the
Rebellion. Still, I must eantinue to do so
much as may seem to be required by the
public safety.

pany of Nicaragua was declared forfeited
by the Nicaraguan government on the 10th
of October, on the ground of non-fulfill
ment within the ten years term stipulated
in the contract. The Maritime Canal com­
pany has lodged a protest against this ac­
tion, alleging rights in the premises which
appear worthy of consideration. This gov­
ernment exDects that Nicaragua will af­
oru Gne protestants a full and fair hear­
ing upon the merits of the case.
The Nicaragua Canal commission, which
had been engaged upon the work of ex­
amination and survey for a ship canal
route across Nicaragua, having completed
its labors and made its report, was dis­
solved on May 31, and on June 10 a new
commission, known as the Isthmian Canal
commission, was organized under the terms
of the act approved March 3, 1899, for the
purpose of examining the American isth­
mus with a view to determining the most
practicable and feasible route for a ship
canal across that isthmus, with its prob­
able cost, and other essential details.
This commission, under the presidency
of Rear Admiral John G. Walker. U. S. N.
(retired), entered promptly upon the work
intrusted to it, and is now carrying on
examinations in Nicaragua along the route
,of the Panama canal, and in Darien from
the Atlantic, in the neighborhood of the
Atrato river, to the Bay of Panama, on the
Pacific side. Good progress has been
made, but under the law a comprehensive
and complete investigation is called for,
which will require much labor and con­
siderable time for its accomplishment.
The work will be prosecuted as expedi­
tiously as possible and a report made at
the earliest practicable date.
The great importance of this work can­
not be too often or too strongly pressed
upon the attention of the congress. In my
message of a year ago I expressed my
views of the necessity of a canal which
would link the two great oceans, to which
I again invite your consideration. The
reasons then presented for early action are
even stronger now.
A pleasing incident in the relations of
this government with that of Chile oc­
curred in the generous assistance given to
the warship Newark when in distress in
Chilian waters. Not alone in this way has
the friendly disposition of Chile found ex­
pression. That country has acceded to the
convention for the establishment of the
Bureau of the American Republics, in
which organization every independent
state of the continent now shares.
The exchange of ratifications of a con­
vention for the revival of the United States
and Chilean Claims commission and for
the adjudication of claims heretofore pre­
sented but not determined during the life
of the previous commission, has been de­
layed by reason of the necessity for fresh
action by the Chilean senate upon the
amendments attached to the ratification of
the treaty by the United States senate.
This formality is soon to be accomplished.
American Interests in Chinn.
In view of disturbances in the populous
provinces of Northern China, where are
many of our citizens, and of the imminence
of disorder near the capital and toward
the seaboard, a guard of marines was land­
ed from the Boston and stationed during
last winter in the legation compound at
Pekin. With the restoration of order this
protection was withdrawn.
The Interests of our citizens in that vast
empire have not been neglected during the
past year. Adequate protection has been
secured for our missionaries and some in­
juries to their property have been re­
dressed.
American capital has sought and found
various opportunities of competing to
carry out the internal improvements which
the imperial government is wisely en­
couraging, and t, develop the natural re­
sources of the empire. Our trade with China has continued to grow, and our
commercial rights under existing treaties
have been everywhere maintained during
the past year, as they will be in the fu­
ture.
The extension of the area open to inter­
national foreign settlement at Shanghai
and the opening of the ports of Nanking
Tsing-Tao (Kiao Chao) and Ta-Lien-Wan
to foreign trade and settlement will doubt­
less afford American enterprise additional
facilities and new fields, of which it will
not be slow to take advantage.
In my message to congress of Dec. 5,
1898, I urged that the recommendation
which had been made to the speaker of
the house of representatives by the secre­
tary of the treasury on the 14th of June,
1898, for an appropriation for a commission
to study the commercial and industrial
conditions in the Chinese empire and re­
port as to the opportunities for and ob­
stacles to, the enlargement of markets in
China for the raw, products and manu­
factures of the United States, should re­
ceive at your hands the consideration
which its importance .and timeliness mer­
ited, but the congress failed to take ac­
tion.
I now renew this recommendation, as the
importance of the subect has steadily
grown since it was first submitted and no
time should be lost in studying for our­
selves the resources of this great field for
American trade and enterprise.
'The Paris Exposition.
The deatn of President Faure in Febr~u­
ary last called forth those sincere expres­
sions of sympathy which befit the rela­
tions of two republics as closely allied by
unbroken historic ties as are the United
States and France. Preparations for the
representation of the industries, arts and
products of the United States at the
World's exposition to be held in Paris
next year continue on an elaborate and
comprehensive scale, thanks to the gener­
ous appropriation provided by congress
and to the friendly interest the French
government has shown in furthering a
typical exhibit of American progress.,
There has been allotted to the Unit"".]
States a considerable addition of space,
while placing our country in the fir.a rank
among exhibitors, does not suffice to meet
the increasingly urgent doicands of our
manufactures. The efforts of commis­
sioner general are ab'y directed toward a
strictly representati-e display of all that
must characteri,tically mark American
achievement in the inventive arts, and
most adequately shows the excellence of
our natural productions.
In this age of keen rivalry among na­
tions for mastery in commerce, the doc­
trine of evolution and the rule of the sur­
vival of the fittest must be as inexorable
in their operation as they are positive in
the results they bring about. The place
won in the struggle by an industrial peo­
ple can only be held by unrelaxed en­
deavor and constant advance in achieve­
ment. The present extraordinary impetus
in every line of American exportation and
the astounding increase in the volume and
value of our share in the world's markets
may not be attributed to accidental con­
ditions.
The reasons are not far to seek. They
lie deep in our national character and find
expression year by year in every branch of
handicraft, in every new device whereby
the materials we so abundantly produce
are subdued to the artisan's will and made
to yield the largest, most practical and
most beneficial return. The American
exhibit at Paris should, and I am confi­
dent will, be an open volume, whose les­
sions of skilfully directed endeavor, un­
faltering energy, and consummate per­
formance may be read by all on every
page, thus spreading abroad a clearer
knowledge of the worth of our productions
and the justice of our claim to an im­
portant place in the marts of the world.
To accomplish this by judicious selection,
by recognition of paramount merit in
whatever walk of trade and manufacture
it may appear and by orderly classifica­
tion and attractive installation is the task
of our commission.
The United States government building
is approaching completion, and no effort
will be spared to make it worthy, in
beauty of architectural plan and in com­
pleteness of display, to represent our na­
tion. It has been suggested that a per­
manent building of similar or appropriate
design be erected on a convenient site,
already given by the municipality, near
the exposition grounds, to serve in com­
memoration of the part taken by this
country in this great enterprise, as an
American national institute, for our coun­
trymen resorting to Paris for study.
I am informed by our commissioner gen­
eral that we shall have in the American
sections at Paris over 7,000 exhibitors,
from every state in our country, a num­
ber ten times as great as those which were
represented at Vienna in 1873, six times
as many as those in Paris in 1889. This
statement does not include the exhibits
from either Cuba, Porto Rico, or Hawaii,
for which arrangements have been made.
A number of important international
congresses on special topics affecting pub
lic interests, are proposed to be held in
Paris next summer in connection with the
exposition. Efforts will be made to have
the several technical branches of our ad
ministration efficiently represented at
those conferences, each in its special line,
and to procure the largest possible con­
course of state representatives, particular­
ly at the congresses of public charity and
of medicine.
Cordial Relations With Germany.
Our relations with Germany continue to
be cordial. The increasing intimacy of
direct association has been marked dur­
ing the year by the granting permission
in April for the landing on our shores of
a cable from Borkum Emden, on the
North sea, by way of the Azores, and also
by the conclusion on Sept. 2 of a parcels
post convention with the German empire.
In all that promises closer relations of
intercourse and commerce and a better
understanding between two races having
sad many traits in common, Germany can
be assured of the most cordial cooperation
of this government and people. We may
be rivals in many material paths, but our
rivalry should .be generous and open, ever
aiming toward the attainment of larger
results and the mutually beneficial ad­
vancement of each in the line of its espe­
cial adaptability.
The several governments of the empire
seem reluctant to admit the natural ex­
cellence of our food products and to ac­
cept the evidence we constantly tender of
the care with which their purity is guarded
by rigid inspection from the farm, through
the slaughter house and the packing estab­
lishments, to the port of shipment. Our
system of control over exported food
staples invites examination from any
quarter and challenges respect by its effi­
cient thoroughness.
It is to be hoped that in time the two
governments will act in common accord
toward the realization of their common
purpose to safeguard the public health and
to the insuring of the purity and whole­
someness of all food products imported by
,either country from the other. Were the
congress to authorize an invitation to
Germany, in connection with the pending
reciprocity negotiations, for the execution
of a joint commission of scientific experts
and practical men of affairs to conduct a
searching investigation of food production
and exportation in both countries and re­
port to their respective legislatures for the
adoption of such remedial measures as
they might recommend for either, the way
might be opened for the desirable result
indicated.
Efforts to obtain for American life in­
surance companies a full hearing as to
their business operations in Prussia have
after several years of patient representa­
tion, happily succeeded and one of the
most important American companies has
been granted a concession to continue
business in that kingdom. I am also glad
to announce that the German insurance
companies have been readmitted by the
superintendent of insurance to do busi­
ness in the state of New York.
Subsequent to the exchange of our peace
treaty with Spain, Germany acquired the
Caroline islands by purchases, paying
therefor $5,000,000. Assurances have been
received from the German government
that the rights of American missionaries
and traders there will be considerably ob­
served.
Unsettled Disputes With Canada.
In my last annual message I referred to
the pending negotiations with Great Brit­
ain in respect to the Dominion of Canada.
By means of an executive agreement a
Joint High commission has been created
for the purpose of adjusting all unsettled questions between the United States and
Canada embracing twelve subjects, among
which were the questions of the fur seals,
the fisheries of the coast and contiguous
inland waters, the Alaskan boundary, the
transit of merchandise in bond, the alien
labor laws, mining rights, reciprocity in
trade, revision of the agreement respect­
ing naval vessels in the Great Lakes, a
more complete marking of parts of the
boundary, provision for the cpnveyance of
criminals, and for wrecking and salvage.
Much progress has been made by the com­
mission toward the adjustment of many
of these questions where it became appar­
ent that an irreconcilable difference of
views was entertained respecting the de­
limitation of the Alaskan boundary. In
the face of an agreement as to the mean­
ing of articles 3 and 4 of the treaty of 1825
between Russia and Great Britain, which
defined the boundary between Alaska and
Canada, the American commissioners pro­
posed that the subject of boundary be laid
aside and that the remaining questions or
difference be proceeded with, some of
which were so far advanced as to assure
the probability of a settlement. This be­
ing declined by the British commissioners,
an adjournment was taken until the boun­
dary should be adjusted by the two gov­
ernments. The subject has been receiving
the careful attention which its importance
demands, with the result that a modus
vivendi for provisional demarkations in
the region about the head of Lynn canal
has been agreed upon; and it is hoped that
negotiations now in nrogress between the
two governments will end in an agreement
for the establishment and delimitation of
a permanent boundary.
Apart from these questions growing out
of our relationship with our northern
neighbor, most friendly disposition and
ready agreement have marked the discus­
sion of numerous matters s ising in the
vast and intimate intei""course of the
United States with Great Britain.
Neutrality in the Boer War.
This ;overnment has maintained an at­
titude of neutrality in the unfortunate
contest between Great Britain and the
Boer states of Africa. We have remained
faithful to the precept of avoiding entan­
gling alliances as to affairs not of our di­
rect concern. Had circumstances sug­
gested that the parties to the quarrel
would have welcomed any kindly expres­
sion of the hope of the American people
that war might have been averted, good
offices would have been gladly tendered.
The United States representative at Pre­
toria was early instructed to see that all
neutral Americans interests be respected
by the combatants. This has been an easy
task in view of the positive declarations
of both British and Boer authorities that
the personal and property rights of our
foreign citizens should be observed.
Upon the withdrawal of the British
ageqnt from Pretoria the United States
consul was authorized, upon the request
of the British government and with the
assent of the South African and Orange
Firee State government, to exercise the
customary good offices of a neutral for'the
care of British interests. In the discharge
of this function I am happy to say that
abundant opportunity has been afforded
to show the impartiality of this govern­
ment toward both the combatants.
Lynching of Alien Subjects.
For the fourth time in the present decade
question has arisen with the government
of Italy in relation to the lynching of
Italian subjects. The latest of these de­
plorable events occurred at Tallulah, La.,
whereby five unfortunates of Italian ori­
gin were taken from jail and hanged. The
authorities of the state and a representa­
tive from the Italian embassy had sepa­
rately investigated the occurrence with
discrepant results, particularly as to the
alleged citizenship of the victims, and it
not appearing that the state had been able
to recover and punish the violators of the
law, an independent investigation has been
set on foot, through the agency of the De­
partment of State, and is still in progress.
The result will enable the executive to
treat the question with the government of
Italy in a spirit of fairness and justice.
A satisfactory solution will doubtless be
reached. The recurrence of these dis­
tressing manifestations of blind mob fury
directed at dependents or natives of a
foreign country suggests that the contin­
gency has arisen for action by congress
in the direction of conferring upon the
federal courts jurisdiction in this class of
international cases where the ultimate re­
sponsibility of the .federal government
may be involved. The suggestion is not
new. In his annual message of Dec. ,,,;
1891, my predecessor, President Harrison,
said:
It would, I believe, be entirely competent for
congress to make offenses against the treaty
righlts of foreliners domiciled in the United
States cognlzahle in the Federal courts. This
has not, however, been done, and the federal of­
fliecrs and courts have no power in such cases
to intervene either for the protection of a for­
eign citizen or for the punishment of his slay­
ers. It seems to me to follow, in this state of
the law, that the officers of the state charged
with the police and judicial powers in such
cases. must, in tile conshiler:ltiou of intern­
tional questions growing out of such incidents,
he regarded ill sllspenllse as federail agents as to
make this government answerable for their nets
in cases where it would be answerable if the
United States had used its coustitutional power
to define and punish crimes against treaty rights.
Uraes Federnl Juairisastion­
A bill to provide for the punishment of
violations of treaty rights of aliens was
introduced in the senate March 1, 1892, and
reported favorably March 30. Having
doubtless in view the language of that part
of article III. of the treaty of Feb. 26, 1871,
between the United States and Italy, which
stipulates that ""the citizens of each of the
high contracting parties shall receive, in
the states and territories of the other, most
constant protection and security for their
persons and property, and shall enjoy in
this respect the same rights and privileges
as are or shall be granted to the natives,
on their submitting themselves to the con.
ditions imposed upon the natives,"" the bill
so introduced and reported provided that
any act committed in any state or terri­
tory of the United States in violation of
the rights of a citizen or subject of a for­
eign country secured to such citizen or
subject by treaty between the United
States and such foreign country and con­
stituting a crime under the laws'of a state
or territory shall constitute a like crime
against the United States and be cogniza­
ble in the Federal courts. No action was
taken by congress in the matter.
I earnestly recommend that the subject
be taken up anew and acted upon during
the present session. The necessity for
some such provision abundantly appears.
Precedent for constituting a federal juris­
diction in criminal cases where aliens are
sufferers is rationally deducible from the
existing statute ,which gives to the Dis­
trict and Circuit courts of the United
States jurisdiction of civil suits brought by
aliens where the amount involved exceeds
a certain sum.. If such jealous solicitude
be shown for alien rights in cases of mere­
ly civil and pecuniary import, how much
greater should be the public duty to take
cognizance of matters affecting the life and
rights of aliens under the settled, princi­
ples of international law no less than un­
der treaty stipulation, in case of such
transcendent wrong doing as mob murder,
especially when experience has shown that
local justice is too often helpless to pun­
ish the offenders.
After many years of endeavor on the
part of this government to that end the
Italian government has consented to enter
into negotiations for a naturalization con­
vention, having for one of the objects
the regulation of the status of` Italians
(except those of an age for active mili­
tary service) who, having been natural­
ized in the United States, may revisit
Italy. It is hoped that with the mutually
conciliatory spirit displayed a successful,
conclusion will be reached.
Treaty With Japan.
The treaty of commerce and navigation!
between the United States and Japan on'
Nov. 22, 1894, took effect in accordance with
the terms of its XIXth article on the 17th
of July last, simultaneously with the en­
forcement of like treaties with the other
powers, ',xcept France, whcse ccnvwntion.
did not go into operation until Aug. 4, the
United States being, however, giantedl up
to that date all the privileges and rights
accorded to French citizens under the old
French treaty. By this notable conven­
tional reform Japans apositic;l as a fu!ly
independent sovereign power is assure~l.
control being gained of taxation, customs
revenues, judicial administration, ccast­
ing trade, and all other domestic func­
tions of government and foreign extra­
territorial rights being renounced.
Comprehensive codes of civil and crin­ inal procedure according to Western
methods, public instruction, patents and
copyrights, municipal administration, in­
cluding jurisdiction over the former for­
eign settlement, customs tariffs and pro­
cedure, public health, and other adminis­
trative measures have been proclaimed,
The working of the new system has giver
rise to no material complaints on the parn
of the American citizens or interests,
circumstance which attests the ripe con­
sideration with which the change has beer
prepared.
Valuable assistance was rendered by the
Japanese authorities to the United States
transport ship Morgan City while stranded
at Kobe. Permission has been granted tc
land and pasture army horses at Japanese
ports of call on the way to the Philippine
islands. These kindly evidences of good
will are highly appreciated.
Pacific Cable Project.
The Japanese government has shown
a lively interest in the proposition of the
Pacific Cable company to add to its proj­
ected cable line to Hawaii, Guam, and the
Philippines, a branch connection with the
coast of Japan. It would be a gratifying
consummation were the utility of.the con­
templated scheme enhanced by bringing
Japan and the United States into direct
telegraphic relation.
Without repeating the observations oi
my special message of Feb. 10. 1899, con­
cerning the necessity of a cable to Manila
I respectfully invite attention to it.
I recommend that, in case the congress
should not take measures to bring about
this result by direct action of the govern­
ment, the postmaster general be author­
ized to invite competitive bids for the es­
tablishment of a cable; the company mak­
ing the best responsible bid to be awarded
the contract; the successful company tc
give ample bonds to insure the completior
of the work within a reasonable time.
New Treaty With Mexico.
The year has been marked by constant
increase in the intimacy of our relations
'with Mexico and in the magnitude of mu­
tually advantageous interchanges. This
government has omitted no opportunity
to show its strong desire to develop and
perpetuate the ties of cordiality now so
long happily unbroken. Following the
termination on Jan. 20, 1899, by Mexico
of the convention of extradition of Dec.
11, 1861, a new treaty more in accordance
with the ascertained needs of both coun­
tries was signed Feb. 22, 1899, and ex­
changed in the city of Mexico on the 22nd
of April last. Its operation thus far has
been effective and satisfactory. A recent
case has served to test the application of
its fourth article, which provides that
neither party shall be bound to deliver up
its own citizens, but that the executive
authority of each shall have the power to
deliver them up if in its discretion it be
deemed proper to do so. The extradition
of Mrs. Mattle Rich, a citizen of the
United States, charged with homecide,
committed in Mexico, was after mature
consideration directed by me in the con­
viction that ends of justice would be
thereby subserved. Similar action, on ap­
propriate occasion, by the Mexican execu­
tive will not only tend to accomplish the
desire of both governments that grave
crimes go not unpunished, but also to re­
press lawlessness along the border of the
two countries. The new"" treaty stipulates
that neither government shall assume ju­
risdiction in the punishment of crimes
committed exclusively within the territory
of the other.. This will obviate in future
the embarrassing controversies which
have heretofore arisen through Mexico's
assertion of a claim to try and punish an
American citizen for an offense committed
within the jurisdiction of the United
States.
The International Water Boundary com­
mission, organized by the convention of
March 1, 1899, for the adjustment cf ques­
tions affecting the Rio Grande frontier,
has not yet completed its labors. A fur­
ther extension of its term for one year,
until Dec. 24, 1899, was effected by a con­
vention signed Dec. 2, 1898, and exchanged
and proclaimed in February last.
An invitation extended to the president
of Mexico to visit Chicago in October, on
the occasion of the laying of the corner
stone of the United States government
building in that city was cordially accept­
ed by him, with the necessary consent of
the Mexican congress, but the illness of
a member of his family prevented. his at­
tendance. The minister of foreig'l rela­
tions, however. came as the personal rep­
resentative of President Diaz, and in that
high character was duly honored.
Bering Sea Dispute With Russia.
Claims growing out of the seizure of
American sealing vessels in ""Bering sea
have been under discussion with .the gov­
ernment of Russia for several years, with
the recent happy result of an agreement
to submit them to the decision of a single
arbitrator. By this act Russia affords
proof of her adherence to the beneficent
principle of arbitration which her pleni­
potentiaries conspicuously ravored at The
Hague disarmament conference when it
was advocated by the representatives of
the United States.
A suggestion for a permanent exposi­
tion of our products and manufactures in
Russia, although not yet fully shaped, has
been so cordially welcomed by the im­
perial government that it may not inaptly
take a fitting place in whatever legisla­
tion the congress may adopt looking to
enlargement of our commercial opportuni­
ties abroad.
The Partition of Samoa.
Important events have occurred in the
Samoan islands. The election, according
to the laws and customs of Samoa, of a
successor to the late King Malletoa Lau-,
pepa, developed a contest as to the val­
idity of the result, which issue, by the
terms of the general act, was to be de­
cided by the chief justice. Upon his rend­
ering a judgment in favor of Malietoa
Tanu, the rival chief, Mataafa, took up
arms. The active intervention of Ameri­
can and British warships became inpera­
tive to restore order, at the cost of san­
guinary encounters. In this emergency a
joint commission of representatives of the
United States, Germany and Great Britain,
was sent to Samoa to investigate the situ­
ation and provide a temporary i'eminedy.
By its active efforts a peaceful solution
was reached for the time being, the king­
ship being abolished and a provisidnal
government established. Recommenda­
tions unanimously made by the commis­
sion for a permanent adjustment of the
Samoan question were taken ubder con­
sideration by the three powers parties to
the general act. But the more they were
examined the more evident it became that
a radical change was necessary in the re­
lations of the powers to Samoa.
The inconveniences and possible perils
of the tripartite scheme of supervision and
control in the Samoan group by powers
having little interest in common in that
quarter beyond commercial rivalry has
been once more emphasized by the recent
events. The suggested remedy of - the
Joint commission, like the scheme it aimed
to replace, amounted to what has been
styled a tridominium, being the exercise
of the functions of sovereignty by an
unanimous agreement of three powers. The
situation had become far more intricate
and embarrassing from every point of view
than it was when my predecessor in 1894,
summed up its perplexities and condemned
the participation in it of the United States.
The arrangament under Which Samoa
was administered had proved impractica­
ble and unacceptable to all the powers
concerned. To withdraw from the agree­
ment and abandon the islands to dermany
and Great Britain would not be compati­
ble wtih our interests in the archipelago.
To relinquish our rights in the harbor of
Pago Pago, the best anchorage in the Pa­
cific, the occupancy of which had been
leased to the United States in 1878 by the
first foreign treaty ever concluded by Sa­
moa, was not to be thought of either as
regards the needs of our navy or the in­
terests of our growing commerce with the
East. We could not have considered any
proposition for the abrogation of the tIi­
partite control which did not confirm us
in all our rights and safeguard all our na­
tional interests in the islands.
Our views commended themselves to the
other powers. A satisfactory arrangement
was concluded between the governments
of Germany and of England, by virtue of
which England retired from Samoa in
view of compensations in other directions,
and both powers renounced in favor of the
United States all their rights and claims
over and in respect to that portion of the
group lying to the east of the one hun­
dred and seventy-first degree of west long­
itude, embracing the islaqdy of Tutuila, Ofoo, Olesenga and Mauna. I transmit to
the senate, for its constitutional action
thereon, a convention, which besides the
provisions above mentioned also guaran­
tees us the same privileges and conditions
in respect to commerce and commercial
vessels in all of the islands of Samoa as
those possessed by Germany.
Claims have been preferred by white res­
idents of Samoa on account of the injuries
alleged to have been suffered through the
acts of the treaty governments in putting
down the late disturbances. A convention
has been made between the three powers
for the investigation and settlement of
these claims by a neutral arbitrator, to
which the attention of the senate will be
invited.
RESULTS OF THE WAR.
My annual message of last year was
necessarily devoted in the great part to a
consideration of the Spanish war and of
the results it wrought and the conditions
it imposed for the future. I am gratified
to'announce that the treaty of peace has
restored friendly relations between the
two powers. Effect has been given
to' its most important provisions.
The evacuation of Porto Rico hav­
ing already been accomplished on the
18th of October, 1898, nothing remained
necessary there but to continue the pro­
visional military control of the island un­
til the congress should enact a suitable
government for the ceded territory. Of the
character and scope of the measures to
that end I shall treat in another part of
this message.
Cuba and Its Future.
The withdrawal of the authority of
Spain from the island of Cuba was effected
by the 1st of January, so that full re­
establishment of peace found the relin­
qulshed territory held by us in trust for,
the inhabitants, maintaining, under the
direction of the .executive, such govern­
ment and control therein as should con­
serve public order, restore the productive
conditions of peace so long disturbed by
the instability and disorder which prevailed
for the greater part of the preceding three
decades, and built up that tranquil de­
velopment of the domestic state, whereby
alone can be realized the high purpose, as
proclaimed in the joint resolution adopted
by the congress on the 19th of April, 1898,
by which the United States disclaimed
any disposition or .intention to exercise
sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over
Ciba, except for the pacification thereof,
and asserted its determination when that
was accomplished to leave the government
and control of the island to its people.
The pledge contained in this resolution is
of the highest honorable obligation and
must be sacredly kept.
I believe, that substantial progress has
been made in this direction. All the ad­
ministrative measures adopted in Cuba
have aimed to fit it for a regenerated ex­
istence by enforcing the supremacy of
law and justice; by placing wherever
practicable the machinery of administra­
tion in' the bands of the inhabitants; by
instituting needed sanitary reforms; by
spreading education; by fostering industry
and trade; by inculcating public morality,
and, in short, by taking every rational
step to aid the Cuban people to attain to
that plane of self-conscious respect and
self-reliant unity which fits an enlightened
community for self-government within its
own sphere, while enabling it to fulfill all
outward obligations.
This nation has assumed before the
world a grave responsibility for the future
good government of Cuba. We have ac­
cepted a trust the fulfillment of which
calls for the sternest integrity of purpose
and the exercise of the 'highest wisdom.
The new Cuba yet' to arise from the ashes
of the past must needs be bound to us by
ties of singular intimacy and strength if
its enduring welfare is to be assured.
Whether those ties shall be organic or
conventional, the destinies of Cuba are
in some rightful form and manner irre­
vocably linked with our own, but how and
how far is for the future to determine in
the ripeness of events. Whatever the out­
come, we must see to it that free Cuba
be a reality, not a name, a perfect entity,
not a hasty experiment bearing within it­
self the element of failure. Our mission,
to accomiplish which we took upI the wagers
.of battle, is not to be fulfilled by turning
adrift any loosely framed commonwealth
to face the vicissitudes which too often
attend weaker states whose,natural wealth
and abundant resources are offset by the
incongruities of their political oragniza­
tion and the recurring occasions for inter­
nal rivalries to sap their strength and dis­
sipate their energies. The greatest bless­
ing which can coine to Cuba is the resto-'
ration of her agricultural and industrial
prosperity, which will give employment to
idle 'men and redstablish the pursuits of
peace. This is her chief and immediate
need.
On the 19th of August last an order was
made for the taking of the census in the
island, to be completed on the 30th of No­
vember. By the treaty of peace the Span­
ish.people on the island have until Anril
11, 1900,' to elect whether they will re­
main citizens of Spain or become citizens
of Cuba. Until then it cannot be defi­
nitely ascertained who shall be entitled
to participate in the formation of the gov­
ernment of Cuba. By that time the re­
sults of the census will have been tabu­
lated and we shall proceed to provide for
elections which will commit the municipal
governments of the island to the efficers
elected by the people. The experience
thus acquired will prove of great value in
the formation of a representative conven­
tion of the people to draft a constitution
and establish a system of independent
government for the island. In the mean­
time and so long as we exercise control
over the -island the products of Cuba
should have a market in the United
States on as good terms and with as fa­
vorable rates of duty as are given to the
West India islands under treaties of
reciprocity which shall be made.
For the relief of the distressed in the
island of Cuba the War department has
issued­ supplies to destitute persons
through the officers of the army, which
have amounted to 5,493,000 rations, at a
cost of $1,417,554.97.
To promote the disarmament of the
Cuban volunteer army and in the inter­
est of public peace and the welfare of the
people the sum of $75 was paid to each
Cuban soldier borne upon the authenticat­
ed rolls, on condition that he should de­
posit his arms with the authorities desig­
nated by the United States. The sum thus
disbursed aggregated $2,547,750, which was
paid from the emergency fund provided
by the act of Jan. 5, 1899, for that pur­
pose.
Out of the Cuban island revenues during
the six months ending June 30, 1899, $1,,­
712,014.20 was expended for sanitation,
$293,881.70 for charities and hospitals, and
$88,944.03 for aid to the destitute.
Relations Renewed With Spain.
Following the exchange of ratifications
of the treaty of peace the two govern­
ments accredited ministers to each other.
Spain sending to Washington the Duke
of Arcos, an eminent diplomatist, pre""i­
ously stationed in Mexico, while the Unit­
ed States transferred to Madrid the Heon.
Bellamy Storer, its minister at Brussels.
This was followed by the respective ap­
pointment of consuls, thereby fully resum­
ing the relations interrupted by the war.
In addition to its consular representation
in the United States, the Spanish govern­
ment has appointed consuls for Cuba, who
have been provisionally recognized during
the military administration of the affairs
of that island.
Judicial intercourse between the courts
of Cuba and Porto Rico, and of Spain has
been established, as provided by the
treaty of peace.
The Cuban political prisoners in Spanish
penal stations have been and are being
released and returnied to their homes, in
accordance with article VI. of the treaty.'
Negotiations are about to be had for de­
fining the conventional relations between
the two countries, which fell into abey­
ance by reason of the war. I trust that
those will include a favorable arrange­
ment for commercial reciprocity under the
terms of sections 3 and 4 of the current
Tariff act. In these, as in all matters of
international concern, no effort will be
spared to respond to the good disposition
of Spain, and to cultivate in all practicable
ways the intimacy which should prevail
between two nations whose past history
has so often and in so many ways been
marked by sincere friendship and by com­
munity of interests.
I would recommend appropriate legisla­
tion in order to carry into execution arti­
cle VII. of the treaty of peace with Spajn,
by which the United States assumed 'the
payment of certail claims for indemnity
of its citizens agahst Spain. -
SOME FOREIGN FROBLEMS.
The United Stabs minister to Turkey
continues, under irstructions, to press for
a money payment in satisfaction of the
just claims for injuies suffered by Amer­
ican citizens in tie disorders of several
years past and for wrongs done to them
by the Ottoman aufliorities. Some of these
claims are of many years standing. This
government is hopedul of a general agree­
ment in this regarc. In the Turkish em­
pire the situation cf. our citizens remains
unsatisfactory. Owu efforts during nearly
forty years to bring about a convention of
naturalization seen to be on the brink of
final failure through the announced policy
of the Ottoman Porte to refuse recogni­
tion of the alien status of native Turkish
subjects naturalized abroad since 1867. Our
statutes do not a'low this government to
admit any distinction betwen the treat­
ment of native and' naturalized Americans
abroad,. so that' ceaseless controversy
arises in cases where persons owing in the
eye of international law a dual allegiance
are prevented from entering Turkey or are
expelled after entrance. Our law in this
rgard contrasts with that of the Suropean
states. The British act, for instance, does
not claim effedt for the naturalization of
an alien in the event of his return to his
native country, unless the change be rec­
ognized by ,the law of that country or stip­
ulated by treaty between it and'the natu­
ralizing state.
Discrimination Against Our Prod­
nets.
The arbitrary treatment, in some in­
stances, of American productions in Tur­
key has attracted attention of late, notably
in regard to our flour. Large shipments
by the recently opened direct steamship
line to Turkish ports have been denied
entrance on the score that, although of
standard composition and unquestioned
purity, the flour was pernicious to health
cated by antiquated and' untrustworthy
because of deficient 'elasticity,"" as indi­
cated by antiquated and untrustworthy
tests. Upon due protest by the American
minister and it appearing that the act was
a virtual discrimination against our prod­
uct, the shipments in question were ad­
mitted. In the e, as 'in all instances,
wherever occurritig, when American prod­
ucts may be subjected itn a foreign country
upon specious pretexts. to discrimination
compared with the lik6 products of anoth­
er country, this government will use its
earnest efforts to sedure fair and equal
treatment for its citizens and their goods.
Failing this, it will not hesitate to apply
whatever corrective may be provided by
the statutes.
The Venezuela Award.
The international Committee of Arbi­
tration appointed under the' Anglo-Vene­
zuelan treaty of 1897, rendered an award
on Oct. 3 last, whereby the boundary line'
between Venezuela and British Guiana is
determined, thus ending a controversy
which h'as existed for the greater Dart of
the century. The award, as to which the
arbitrators were unanimous, wh'ile not
meeting the extreme contention of either
party, gives to Great Britian a large share
on the interior territory in dispute and
to Venezuela the entire mouth of the Orin­
oco, including Barima point and the Car­
ibbean littoral for some distance to the
eastward. The decision appears to be
equally satisfactory to both parties.
Venezuela has once more undergone a
revolution. The insurgents, under Gen.
Castro, after a sanguinary engagement in
which they suffered much: loss,' rallied in
the mountainous interior and advanced to­
ward the capital. The bulk of the army
having sided with the movement, Presi­
dent Andrade quitted Caracas, where Gen.
Castro set up a provisional government
with which our minister and the repre­
sentatives of other powers entered into
diplomatic relations on the 20th of No­
vember,' 1899.
Commnnereial Treaties.
The foarth section of the Tariff act ap­
proved July 24, 1897, appears to provide
only for commercial treaties which should
be entered into by the president and also
ratified by the senate within two years
from its passage. Owing to delays inev­
itable in negotiations of this nature, none
of the treaties initiated under that sec­
tion could be concluded in time for rati­
fication by the senate prior to its ad­
journment on the 4th of March last. Some
of the pending negotiations, however,
were near conclusion at that time and
the resulting conventions have since been
signed by the plenipotentiaries. Others
within both the third and fourth sections
of' the act are still under consideration.
Acting, under the constitutional power of
the executive in respect to the treaties, I
have deemed it my duty while observing
the limitations of concession provided by
the fourth section, to bring to a con­
clusion all pending negotiations, and sub­
mit them to the senate for its advice and
consent.
Conventions of reciprocity have been
signed during the congressional recess
with Great' Britain for the respective col­
onies of British Guiana, Barbadoes, Ber­
muda, Jamaica and Turks and Caicos is­
lands, and with the Republic of Nicar­
agua.
Important reciprocal conventions have
also been cor.dluded with France and with
the Argentine Republic.
Consular Aids to Business.
In my last annual message the progress
noted in the work of the diplomatic and
consular offcers in \collecting information
as to the industries and commerce of other
countries and in the care and promptitude
with which their reports are printed and
distributed, hca continued during the past
year with increasingly valuable results in
suggesting new sources of demand for
American products and in pointing out the
obstacles still to be overcome in facilitat­
ing the remarkable expansion of our for­
eign trade. It will doubtless be gratifying
to congress to learn that the various
agencies of the department of state are
cooperating in these endeavors with a zeal
and effectiveness which are not. only re­
ceiving the cordial recognition of our busi­
ness interests but are exciting the emula­
tion of other governments. In any re­
arrangement of the great and complicated
work of obtaining official data of an eco­
nomic character which congress may
undertake it is most important in my
judgment that the results already secured
by the efforts of the department of state
should be carefully considered with a view
to a judicious development and increasdd
utility of our export trade.
International Union of American
Republics.
The interest taken by the various states
forming the international union of Ameri­
can republics in the work of its organic
bureau is evidenced by the fact that for
the first time since its creation in 1890,
all the republics of South and Central
America are now represented in it.
The unanimous recommendation of the
international American congress provid­
ing for the international union of Amer­
ican republict stated that it should con­
tinue in force during a term of ten years
of the date of its organization and no
country becoming a member of the Union
should cease to be a member until the
end of said period of ten years and unless
twelve months before the expiration of
said period a majority of the members of
the Union had given to the secretary of
state of the United States official notice
of their wish to terminate the union at
the end of its first period that the union
should coninue to be maintained for an­
other period of ten years and thereafter
under the same condition, for successive
periods of ten years each. The period
for notification expired on July 14, 1899,
without any of the members having given
the necessary notice of withdrawal. Its
maintenance is therefore assured for the
next ten years. In view of this fact and
of the numerous questions of general
interest and common benefit to all of the
republics of America, some of which were
considered by the first international
American conference, but not finally set­
tled, and others which have since then
grown to importance, it wo'ildO seem te.
pedient that the various republics consti­
tuting the Union should be invited to hold
at an early date another conference in the
capital of one of the other countries other
than the United States, which has already
enjoyed this honor.
The purely international character of
the work being done by the bureau and
the appreciation of its value are further
appraised by the active cooperation which the various governments of the Latin­
American republics and their diplomatic
representatives in this capital are now ex­
hibiting and the zealous endeavors they
are making to extend its field of useful­
ness, to promote through it commercial
intercourse and strengthen the bonds of
amity and confidence between its various
members and the nations of this conti­
nent.
TWO AMERICAN EXPOSITIONS,
Pan-American Exposition.
The act to encourage the holding of the
Pan American exposition on the Niagara
frontier within the county of Erie or Ni­
agara in the state of New York in the year
1901 was approved on March 3, 1899. This
exposition, which will be held in the city
of Buffalo, in the near vicinity of the great
Niagara cataract and within a day's jour­
ney of which reside 40,000,000 of our peo­
ple, will be confined entirely to the West­
ern hemisphere. Satisfactory assurances
have already been given by the diplomatic
representatives of Great Britain, Mexico,
the Central and South American republics
and most of the states that the countries
and states will make an unique, interest­
ing and instructive exthibit, peculiarly il­
lustrative of their material progress dur­
ing the century which is about to close.
The law provides an appropriation of
$500,000 for the purpose of making an ex­
hibit at the exposition by the government
of the United States from its executive de­
partments and from the Smithsonian in­
stitute and National museum, the United
Sates Commission of Fish and Fisheries,
the Department of Labor and the Bureau
of the American Republics. To secure a
complete and harmonious arrangement of
this government exhibit. a Board of Man­
agement has already been created, and
charged with the selection, purchase, prep­
aration, transportation, arrangement and
safe-keeping of the articles and materials
to be exhibited. This board has been or­
ganized and has already entered upon the
performance of its duties as provided by
the law. I have reason to hope and be­
lieve that this exposition will tend more
firmly to cement the cordial relations be­
tween the nations on this continent.
Philadelphia Commercial Museum.
In accordance with an act of congress,
approved Dec. 21, 1898, and under the au­
spices of the Philadelphia Commercial mu­
seum, a most interesting and valuable ex­
position of products and manufactures,
especially adapted to export trade, was
held in Philadelphia from the 14th of Sep­
tember to the 14th of December, 1899. The
representative character of the exhibits
and the widespread interest manifested in
the special objects of the undertaking af­
ford renewed encouragement to those who
look confidently to the steady growth of
our enlarged exportation of manufactured
goods, which has been the most remark­
able fact in the economic fact in the de­
velopment of the United States in recent
years. A feature of this exposition which
is likely to become of permanent and in­
creasing utility to our industries is the
collection of samples of merchandise pro­
duced in various countries with special
reference to particular markets, providing
practical object lessons to United States
manufacturers as to qualities, styles and
prices of goods such as meet the special
demands of consumers and may be ex­
ported wtih advantage.
In connection wtih the exposition an In­
ternational Commercial congress was held,
on the invitation of the Philadelphia Com­
mercial museum, transmitted by the De­
partment of State to the varinus. foreign
governments for an exchange of informa­
tion and opinions with the view to the

THE SPEECH AT LENGTH..
The Queen, in her speech closing the session,
says:.
I:Y LonRDS AND GENTLEMEN:-I am· happy to
be.able to release you from attendance at Parlia­
ment. The relations between myself and foreign
powers continue cordial, and I look forward with
hope and confidence to the uninterrupted main­
tenance of European peace. The visit, paid this
country, on the invitation of my Governent, by
the ruler of Zanzibar, has led to theconclusion of
a supplementary convention, which, I trust, may
be efficacious for the more complete suppression
of the East African slave trade.
I have learned with deep regret.that the expe­
dition dispatched by my Indian Government from
Burmah, with a view to open communication with
the western provinces of China,,has. been treach­
erously attacked by an armed. farce while in
Chinese territory. This outrage,. unhappily in­
volving the death of a young and promising mem­
ber of my consular service, is a.subject of careful
inquiry, and no effort shall be, spared to secure
the punishmet of those by whom it was instigated
and committed.
The condition of my colonial empire is gener­
ally prosperous.
Gentlemen of the House of Commons, I thank
you for the liberal supplies. you 'have voted for
the public service.
My Lords and Gentlemen, it is gratifying to
me to find that the lengthened consideration you
have given the various statutes which have, from
time to time, been passed for the preservation of
peace in Ireland, has resulted in a measure which,
while relaxing the stringency of former enact­

Monday morning and at Its conclusion
went te the capitol and called a spe­
cial meeting of the appropriations com­
mittee. After this meeting Mr. CanCan­
eon introduced the national defense
bill in the house. The appropriations
committee will meet Tuesday.
Chairman Cannen, of the appropria­

a bill entitled ""Making Appropria­
tions for the National Defense."" It is
as follews:
""That there is hereby appropriated
out of the meney in the treasury net
otherwise appropriated for the na­
tional defense and for each and every
purpese connected therewith te be ex­
pended at the discretion of the presi­
dent, and te remain available until
June 30, 1809, fifty million dollars.""
It was referred te the committee en
appropriations.
The Cannen bill, It was learned later,
was the outcome of a conference held
at the white house Monday morning,
at which Mr. Cannen, Secretary Leng,
Mr. Dingley, Secretary Allisen and Gen.
Gresvener were present The situa­
tion was considered se grave that it
was deemed imperative that an im­

should be made at once te prepare for
the national defense. This bill will
be pressed in the house at once. This
can be stated en the highest authority.
The Cannen bill appropriating S50,­

fense, will probably be presented te
the house Tuesday.
Mr. Cannen says he simply intro­
duced the bill in his individual capaci­
ty as a representative. This is, of
course, true, but it can be stated posi­
tively that the bill was introduced as
the result of the conference with the
president and the republican leaders
of both neuses, and that the bill has
the president's approval. The bill will
be cendsidered at the postponed meet­
ing of the appropriations committee
Tuesday, and probably reported for
immediate action. Several democratic
members of the committee say they
will vote for it if the president deems
it necessary and, se far as known,
there will be no vote against it.
In the house Monday Chairman Hull,
of the committee en unitary uffairs,
moved te suspend the rules of the
house and pass the senate bill increas­

With only three negative votes the
rules were suspended at 1:05 p. m. and
the bill was passed.

The cause of over-depression is money

Whoever controls the volume of money

This is a ""crankism"" that lies at the

Liberty cannot long endure in any

is to concentrate wealth in the hands of a

That prices will fall or rise as the vol­
ume of money be increased or deminished
is a law that is unalterable as any law of
nature.—Prof. Walker.

This i's the declaration of a political
economist recognised and provided for in
the people's partv platform.

If the whole volume of monej' in circu­
lation was doubled, prices would double.
If it was increased one-fourth, prices
would raise one-fourth.—John Stuart
Mills.

This is a piece Tf financial philosophy
held by the advocates of the people's party,
and provided for in their platform.

If Congress has the right under the con­

given them to be used by themselves, not
to be delegated to individuals or corpora­

This is the opinion of an old democrat.
For repeating his language, without giv­

the writer a ""crank,"" and republicans
have called him a fool, for ""talking such
nonsense."" But the doctrine is embodied
in the people's party platform.

A decreasing volume of money and fall­

ful of human misery then war, pestilence
and famine. They have wrought more
injustice then all the bad laws ever enact­
ed.—U. S. Money Commission.

This was done year after year by the
republican party, but is now guarded
against by the people's party platform,and
constitutes one of the ""calamityites"" most

If a government contracted a debt with
a certain amount of money in circulation
and then contracted the money volume
before the debt was paid, it is the most
heinous crime a government could com­

This was done under republican rule,
and the people's party platform is framed
to prevent its repetition.

I believe that banking institutions are
more dangerous to our liberties than
standing armies. Already they have rais­

properly belongs. Let the banks exist,

reasonable to require very extraordinary caro

Applause greeted Hill when he
sat down. His friends warmly
congratulated him. The Clevelandites,
angry because of his criticsm on their
chief, do not like it. The spectators pro­
nounce it well worth hearing. Mr. Hill
said:
""The political revolution which com­

an emphatic expression of the popular will
in behalf of certain government allopathic
measures. Measures and not men were
largely the issues involved in that more­

proposed and others then existing, it voiced
the general demand for a discontinuance of
the unwise and indefensible financial system
of silver bullion pubchases by the govern­
ment instead of the coinage contemplated
by the constitution, a system equally a
hinderance to the return of bimetallism as
well as a menace to a sound and stable cur­
rency; it manifested the desire for a better
administration of public affairs, greater
economy in governmental expenditures, and
the exaction of a higher official standard in
the execution of publ'e trusts; it demandea
a more safe, dignified and consistent foreign
policy; and it condemned that abuse or
pervertion of the taxing power of the gov­
ernment which is known as the policy of
protection for protection's sake alone and
declared in favor of a tariff for ravenue.""
CLEVELAND'S IHAWAIIAN ILUnNDEI.

ment'or failure was reluctantly announced,
influenced largely by an aroused public sen­

without sympathy for its traditions and
purposes, and whose political convictions
upon the disputed public questions of the
day if changed at all are carefully concealed.
"" It is to be regretted that the president
should not have been able to find in his own
party some saf. and honored statesman, in
whom he and hit party could have placed
confidence, one ef Democratic instincts and
training, whose management of foreign
affairs would have reflected credit upon the
country, and would have avoided the pro­
mulgation of the on-American policy-a de­
parture from Democratic preceoents-which
was sought to be forced upon an unwill­
ing people. In this view of the situation our
opponents must accept some share of the
responsibility of the errors committed in our
foreign affairs. In other respects the present
administration of our government affords
scant grounds for just criticism.:
He spoke of the repeaI of the Federal Elec­
tion nlaw as a fulfillment of the party pledges
andti a triumph for the just doctrine of state
rights, and endorsed the repeal of the Sher­
man law.
TATRIFF REDUCTION CRIMINAL FOLLY.
Coming then to the main question, tariff
reform, he said that revision should be ap­
proached with circumspection and with a
realizing sense of the changed condi'ion of
the country since 18Si7 and 1890.
"" An extreme reduction of tariff duties at
a time when th"" treasunry was swollen wi h
u surplus of $100,000,000, wh n the coun­
try was reaonanllv -mrann-rons. when nll
our industries were-: operation and when
all our workmen were employed, assumed
a different aspect and presented a different
question when proepo,od now with a large
and growing treasuon deflcit instead of a
surplus staring us in -the face, with our in­
dustries paralyzd, - our manufarcto res
closed, our workmen idla and fol;owing
upon the herlb of one of the most disastrous
financial panics in our history.
""What was safe and prudent and wise
then, it would be criminal fclly to attempt
now. The present is no time for partisan­
ship and Democrats and Ilepubl'cans alike
shoulbt strive to solve exi-tin3 problems in
a spirit of broad patriotism. In the face of
the prostration of private industries and in
the presence of such a paralysis of general
bus ness as the treasury deficit attests, this
bill as framed by its authors and as passed
by the house seeks to double the deficit by
discarding customs revenue and to fill the
void with an income tax.""
THE INCOME TAX ILL-TIMIED AND MSCHnIEVOUs.
The rest of hi espeech was given up to the
income tax question and his opening words
defined his position in unequivccal and
forceful language. He said:
""Against such a scheme, unnecessary, ill­
timed and mischievous-suddenly sprung
upon the country in the hour cf its distress,
undemocratic in its nature and soc:ialistic in
its tr-ndencies-1 enter the protest of the peo­
ple of the state of New York. They utterly
dissent from any proposal to get revenue
for the general government by taxing in­
comes. Their dissent is practically unani­
mous and altogether implacaile.""'
IHe intimated that the Tariff Lill was con­
structed on lines laid down by the adminie­
tration; that it was an anomalous state of
affairs when the president s':oulI be able
to give congress information es to what
had occurred in a committee of the hocs3
and s:cid that ""in these latter days the dis­
tinttiors between the functions and the
prerogativws of the Executive department
on the one hand and the Legillative depart­
ment on the other do not seem to be al­
ways ol srved. The truth is that the first
information which corgr. es had of the
allegeid details of the propcsed bill wc:s in
the mels ige its If.
""But the strangest part of this unprece­
dented proceeding was that in fact that on
the very date of the message, to wit, Dee.
14, 1893, neither the full Committee of
Ways and Means nor the Democratic mem­ bers thereof had agreed upon any income
tax or upon other internal taxation.
- ""The senior senator from Indiana, Mr.
Voorhees, calls this allegation 'a noisy and
re sounding charge.' Let me tell him that it
is not half as noisy as the constant vitua
perations we hear on every hand front
Llatant demagogurs who are abroad in the
land, loudly inve'gbing against the wealth
of the country and impudently demanding
its confiscation through every means which
their devilish ingenuity can invent.
""The publ r: should not be misled into the
belief that only those whcss incum es exceed
$4,000 are affected by this bill. This is a
mistaken idea. In the first place all thcse
having incomes lees than $4,000 but more
than 13,500 are put to the annoyance of
making sworn returns and they neglect it
at their peril.
POOR AFFECTED AS WELL AS THE RICH.
""In the second place, it may reasonably
be apprehended that some portion of the
tax paid will reimburs4 itself by an increase
of rents, where the income was derived from
that siurce. So poor tenants may be
affected in some degree as well as rich land­
lords. The till seriously affects the rights
and interests of building and loan associa­
tions throughout the country incorporated
under state laws. The senate amendments
do not cure the defects complained of.""
Inquiing as to the source of the demand
he said: "" That nothing was heard in its be­
half on the part of the two great political
parties in the campaign of 1892. Neither
the Republican nor the Democratic nlatform
propcsd any such metLto I of raising rev­
enues. No prominent Democrat or Repub­
lican suggcsted any such measure. Its ap­
proval was limited to the ,r'atform of the
newly-formed PopuPst party, and its adro­
cacy was left to Populist orators."" He pro­
tested against the Democratic party being
made a tail to the Populist'kite and denied
the right of-a Democratic concress to make
new-principles for the party not sanctioned
by its representatives in national conven­
tion duly assembled.
The substitution of internal or direct tax,
for custom house taxation, meant the re­
duction of the wages of American workmen
to the European standards. It meant that
degradation of labor; it meant the depriva­
tion of our workmen of the comforts and
luxuries of life, to which they have been ac­
customed.

Europe, the succeeding year, of so much of that specie, by j
the prostration of the business of the country, the s?spcrist in !
ol the banks, snd most extensive bankruptcies. Occurring,
as this would hsve done, at a period when the country was
engaged in foreign war, when consideraMe loans of specie
were required for distant disbursements, and when the b ink?,
the fi-cal agents of the Government, and the depositories of
its m >ney, were suspended, the public credit must have sunk,
and many millions of dollars, as was the case during the war
of 1812, must have been sacrificed in discounts upon loans, j
and upon the depreciated paper currency which tho Govern- j
ment would have been compelled to use.
lender the operations of the constitutional treamry, not a i
dollar has been lost by the depreciation of the currency. The
loans required to prosecute the war with Mexico were nego- |
tiated by the Secretary of the Treasury above per, realizing a j
large premium to the Government. The restraining effect of '
the i?ystem upon the tendencies to exres ive piper issues by j
hanks has saved the Government from heavy IcmsN, and thou- ,
sands of our business men from bankruptcy and ruin. The '
wisdom of the system has lieen testc?t by the experience of
the last two years ; and it i? ilje dictate of scund policy that it
should remain undisturlied. The modifications in some of
the details of this measure, involving none of its essential
principles, heretofore recommended, are again presented for
your favorable consideration.
In my message of the sixth of July last, transmitting to
Congress the rstifiqd treaty of jieace with Mexico, I recom­
mended the adoption of measures for the speedy payment of
the public debt. In reiterating that recommendation, I refer
you to the considerations presented in that message in its sup­
port. The public deM, including that authorized to be nego­
tiated in pursuance of existing laws, and including Treasury
notes, smounted at that time to sixty-five million seven hun­
dred and seventy-eight thousand four hundred and fifty dol­
lar sand forty-one cents.
Funded stock of the United States, amounting to about
half a million of dollars, has been purchased, as authorized
by law, since that period, and the puHic debt has thus lieen
reduced ( the details of which will be presented in the annual
report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
The estimates of expenditures f?w the next fiscal year, sub­
mitted by the Secretary of tne Treasury, it is believed will bs

ample for all necessary purpose*. If th&lt; appropriations maJc
|>y Con?r&lt;ws shall not exceed the amoun estimated, the means
in the Treasury will be sufficient to ddray all the expenses
of the Government, to pay olT the riex instalment of three
millions of dollars to Mexico, which wil fdl due on the thir­
tieth of May next, and still a considealile surplus will re­
main, which should be applied to the farther purchase of the
public stock and reduction of the debt. Should enlirged up­
propriutions be made, the necessary ccn*quence will be to
postpone the payment of the debt. Thiugh our debt, as com­
pared with that of most other nations, s small, it is our true
policy, and in harmony with the genii* of our institutions,
tl at we should present to the world tie rare spectacle of a
great republic, possessing vast resource and wealth, wholly
exempt from public indebtedness. Thii would add still more
to our strength, and give to us a still rmre commanding pJfcf.
tion among the nations of the earth.
The public expenditures should be economical, and bo con­
fined to such necessary objec's us are cliarly within the pow­
ers of Congress. All such as are not ubsolutely demanded
should bj postponed, and the payment of tha public debt at
the earliest practicable period should be i cardinal principle of
our public policy.
For the reason assigned in my last aniual message, I repeat
the recommendation that a branch of Ue mint of the United
States lie established at the citv of Ncp Y'ork. The import­
ance of this measure is greatly incrca^ by the acquisition of
the rich mines of the precious metals in New Mexico and Cali­
forr.ia, and especially in the lalter.
I repeat the recommendation, heretofore made, in favor of
the graduation and reduction of the pr.ce of such of the pub­
lic lands as have been long ottered in the market, and have
remained unsold, and in favor of extejdirig the rights of pre­
emption to actual settlers on the un.sirveyed as well as the
surv&lt; ycJ lands.
|I he conditions and operations of tie army and the state of
other branches of ihe public service uidur the supervision of*
the War Department are satisfactorily presented in the accom­
panying report ol the Secretary of Y7ar.
On the return of peaco, our forcn were withdrawn from
Mexico, and the volunteers and that portion of the regular
army engaged fir the war were disl.inded. Orders have been
issued for stationing the forces of our permanent establish­
ment at various positions in our extended country where troops
may be required. Owing to the remoteness of some of these
?positions, ihe detachments haw not yet reached their destina­
tion. Notwithstanding the extension of the limits &lt; f our
country, and the forces required in the ne.v teriitories, it is
confidently believed that our present military establishment is
sufficient for all exigencies so long as our peaceful relations
remain undisturbed.
Of the amount of militaiy contributions collected in Mexico,
the sum ot seven hundred and sixty nine thousand six hun­
dredand liiiy dollars was applied towards (he payment of the
first instalment due under the treaty with Mexico. The fur­
ther sum of three hundred and forty-six thousand three hun­
drcd and sixty-nine dollars and thirty cents has been paid into
the I rcaiury, and unexpended lulances still remain in the
hands ot disbursing officers and those who were engaged in
the collection of these moneys. After the proclamation of
peace ru further disbursements were made of any unexpended
moneys arising from this source. The balances on hand were
directed to bi: paid into the Treasury, and individual c laims on
the fuid will remain unadjusteJ until Congress shall authorize
their ajttlement and payment. These claims are not conside­
rable in number or amount.
1 recommend to your favorable consideration the suggestions
of tli# Secretary of War and the Secretary of the .\avy in re­
gard to legislation on this subject.
ttir Indian relations are presented in a most favorable view
in the report from the War Department. The wisdom of
our policy in regard to the tiibes within our limits is clearly
minifesttd by their improved and rapidly improving con­
dilon.
A most important treaty with the Msnomoriies has been re­
cently negotiated by the Commissioner of Indian Afl urs in
person, by which all their land in ihe Suite of Wtsconsin­
bfing about four millions of acres?has been ceded to the Uni­
ted States. This treaiy will be submitted to the Senate for ra­
Sfication at an early period of your present session.
Within the bet four years eight important treaties have been
negotiated with different Indian tribe.-, and at a cost of one
million eight hundred and forty-two thousand d liars ; Indian
lands to the amount of more than eighteen million five hundred
thousand acres have been ccded to the United States ? and
provision has been mide for settling in the countiy west of the
Mississippi the tribes which occupied this large extent of the
public domain. The title to all the Indian lands within the
several Statesof our Union, with the exception of a few small
reservations, is now extinguished, and a vast region opened
for settlement and cultivation.
The accompany ing report of the Secretary of the Naw gives
a satisfactory exhibit of the opjra ions and condition of that
branch of the public service.
A number of small voxels suitable for entering the months
of rivers were judiciously purchased during the war, and give
great efficiency to the squadron in the Gulf of Mexico. On
the return of peace, when no longer valuable for naval pur
poses, and liable to constant deterioration, they were sold, and
the money placed in the Treasury.
1 he number of men in the naval rer-icc authorized bv law
?luring the war has been reduced by discharges below the
maximum fixed for the peace establishment. Adequate
squadrons are maintained i'i the several quarters of the globe
where eifierionre has shown their services mav be most us.­
fully employed ; and the naval servir?-? was never in a condi­
tion of higher discipline or greater eflicier cy.
I invite attention to the recommendation of the Secretary of
the Navy on the subject of the marine ,orps. The reduction
of the corps at the end o| the war it quired that four officers
of each of the three lower grades should be dropped from the
rolls. A board of officers made toe selection ; and those
designated w;tc necessarily dismissed, but without any alleged
fault. I concur in opinion with the Secretary that the ser­
vice wruld be improved by reducing the number of landsmen
and increasing the marines. Surh a measure would justify
an increase of the numlier of eft leers to Ihe extent of the re­
dueuon by dismissal, and still the corps w. uld have fewer
officers than a corresponding number of men in the army.
I fie contracts f.* the transportation of the mail in steam­
shipsi convert ble into war steamers promise to realize all the
ienefits toour Commertv and to the navy which were antici­
pated. rhe first steamer thus stcured to the Government w*s
hunched in January, 1817. There are now seven ; and in
*2 . ,b76 he not lew. than seventeen
afloat. VI bile this gre*t national advantage ia secured, our
commercial intercourse is increased and promoted
with Germany, Great Britain, and other parts of Europe, with
all the countries on the west coast of our continent, especially
with Oregon and California, and between the northern and
southern actions of the United States. Considerable revenue
may be expected from portages, but tbe connected line from
Chagres, and thence scross the isthmus to Ore­
gon, cannot fail to exert a benefins! influence, not now to be
estimated, on the interests of the manufactures, commerce
nsvigaUon, and currency of the United *ts?e?. As an un­
p mant part of the system, I recommend to your favorable con­
sideration the establishment of the prop Deed line of s&lt;eamers
hetween New Orleans and Vera Cruz. It promise, the most
happy results m cementing friendship between the two repub­
lics, and in extending reciprocal benefits to tbe trade and
manufactures of both.
The report of the Postmaster General will make known to
yop the operations of that Department for the past year.
It is gratifying to find the revenues of the Department, un- i
der ibe ratea of postage now established by law, *> n?pi?J|y
increasing. The gross amount of postages during the last i
fiscal year amounted fo four million three hundred and eev­
eniy-one thousand and seventy-seven dollars, exceeding the
annual average received for the nine ve*'. immediately pre- |
ceiling the passage of the act of the third of March, IMS,
by the sum of six thousand f>ur hundred and fifty-three dol­
ars, and exceeding the amount received for the vear ending
the thirtieth of June, 1*47, bv the sum of four hundred and i
twenty-five thousand one hundred and eighty-four dollars.
The expenditure* for tbe year, excluding the sum of ninety- j
bHir thousand six hundred ami seventy-two dollars allowed
by Congress at its last session to individual claimants, and
including the aum of one hundred thousand five hundred dol- I
fare pan for tbe aervices cf the line of steamer, between Bre j
men and New York, amounted to f.ur millton one hundred ,
and ninety-e.ght thoi,?and eight hundred and forty five dol- ,
Isr., winch is less than the annual average for the nine years j
previous to ihe act of 1845 by three hundred thousand seven
hundr*l and forty-eight dollars.
The mail routes, on the thirtieth day of June Isst, were one
hundred and aixty-three thousand two bundled and eight |
miles in extent?being sn increase during the lsst yesr of nine
housand three hundred and ninety miles. The mails were j
ransported over tbem, during the aame time, forty-one mil- '
lion twelve thousand five hundred and eeventv-riine mile. , j
making an increase of transportation for the year of two mil- !
lion one hundred and twenty-four thousand six hundred and 1
eighty miles whilst the expense was less than that of the pre­
vious year by four thousand two hundred and thirty five
dollars. J
The increase in the mail transportation within the last three
years haa been five million three hundred and seventy-eight
thousand three hundred and ten miles, whilst the expends
were reduced four hundred snd fifty-six thousand seven hun­
dred and thirty-eight dollara , msking an increas* of service
st the rate of fifteen percent , and a reduction in the expenses
of more than fifteen per cent.
During the past year there have been employed, under con­
tracts with the Port Office Department, two ocean .teamen in
conveying the mails monthly between New York and Bremen,
and one, since October last, performing semi-monthly service
Iwtween Chsrloston ami Havana ; and a contract has been
made for the transportation o&lt; the Pacific maila across the
isthmus from Chagres to Panama.
Under the authority given to the Secretary of the Navy
three ocean steamers have been constructed snd sent to the
i seifie ,m| #re expected to enter upon the mail service be­
weenPanama ami Oregon and the intermediate ports, on the
first of January next, and a fourth has been engager! by hirn
for the service between Havana and Chagres; so that a re­

tjul&amp;t monthly mail line will lie kept up after that time be­
tween the United Stairs and our territories on the Pacific.
Notwithstanding this great increase in the mail service,
| should the revenue continue to increase the present year
' am it did in the last, there will lie received near tour hundred
and tifty thousand dollar* inoie than the expenditures.
These considerations have satisfied the Postmaster General
that, with certain modifications of the act of 1845, the rev?­
i nue may 1>m still further increased, and a reduction of post­
| age* nude to a uniform rale of live cents, without an inter­
j ference with the principle, which has been constantly and pro-'
'? jierly enforced, of making that Department sustain itself.
1 A well-digested cheap postage system is the best means of
: diffusing intelligence among the people, and is of so much im
, portance in a country so extensive as that of the UuitedSlates,
I that I recommend to your favorable consideration the sugges­
| lions of the Postmaster General for its improvement.
Nothing can retard the onward progress of our country, and
prevent us from assuming and maintaining the first rank
i am otig nations, but a disregard of the experience of the past,
j an&lt;l a recurrence *o an unwise public policy. We have just
| clos.'d a foreign war by an honorablo peace?u war rendjred
> n?&lt;eb*:iry and unavoidable* in vindication of the national rights
and honor. The present condition of tbe country is similar
I in some respects to that which existed immediately alter the
' close of the wur with Great Britain in 1815, and the occasion
is deemed to be a proper one to take a retrospect of the mea­
sures of public policy which lolluwed that war. There was
at that period of our history a departure from our earlier |?oli­
i cy. The enlargement of tha powers of the Federal Govern­
| ment by construction, which obtained, was not warranted by
t any just interprotation of the constitution. A few years after
the close of that war, a series of msasurea was adopted which,
j united and combined, constituted what was termed by their
I authors and advocates the ""American system.""
The introduction of tho new policy was for a time favored
by the condition of the country ; by th? heavy debt which had
been contracted during the war ; by the depression of the pub
lie credit; by tbe deranged state of the finances and the cur­
| rency ; and by the commercial and pecuniary einbairas-ment
| which extensively prevailed. Tneae were not the only causes
which led to ila establishment. The events of the wai with
Great Britain, and the embarraasnv nts which had attended
its prosecution, had lefc on the minds of many of dur states­
men the impression that our Government was not strong
enough, and that to wield its resources successfully in great
emergencies, and especially in war, more power should be
concentrated in its hands. This increased power th> y did not
sck to obtain by the legiiimite and prescrib-d mode?an
amendment of the constitution?but by construction. They
saw Government in the Old World basej upon different
I orders of soc ety, and so constituted as to throw the whole
| power of nations into the bunds of a few, who taxed and con­
j trolled the many, without responsibility or restraint. In that
l arrangement they conceived the strength of nations in war
consisted. There was also sometlyng fascinating in the ease,
luxury, and display of the higher orJers, who drew their
wealth from the toil of the laboring millions. The authors of
| the system drew their ideas of political economy from what
' they had witnessed ip Europe, and particularly in Great Bri­
tain. They had viewed the enorm jus wealth concentrated
I in few hands, and had seen the splendor of the overgrown
i cslabh-jhments of an aristocracy which was upheld by the re­
j strictive policy. They forgot to look down upon the poorer
. classes of the English population, upon whose daily and yearly
1 labor the great establishments thev so much admired were
i sustained and supported. They failed to perceive that the
l scantily-fed and half-clad operatives were not only in abject
poverty, but were bound in chains cf oppressive servitude for
i the benefit of favored classes, who were the exclusive objects
I of the care of the Government. '
It was not possible to reconstruct society in the United States
' up &lt;n the European plan. Here there was a written c mstitu­
I tion, by which orders and titles were not recognised ortolerat­
| ed. A system of measures was therefore devised, calcu'ated,
; if not intended, to withdraw power gradually and si!?ntly
j from the States a the mass of the people, and by construction
| to approximate our Government to the European models, sub­
l slit tiling ah aristocracy of wealth for that of orders and titles.
| Without reflecting upon the dissimilarity of our institutions,
and of the condition of our people and those of Europe, they
i conceived the vain idea of building up in the United States a
. system similar to that which they admired abroad. Great
Britain had a national bank of large capital, in whose hands
I was concentrated the controlling monetary and financial power
I of the nation; an institution wielding almost kingly pewer, and
i exerting vast influence upon all the operations of trade, and
upon the policy of the Government itself. Great Britain had
! an enormous public debt, and it had become apart of her pub­
i lie policy to regard this as a ""public blessing."" Great Britain
! had also a restrictive policy, which placed fetters and burdens
1 on trade, and trammelled the productive inuustry of the mass
I of the nation. By her combined syt.trin of policy, the land­
| l?rd and other property-holders were protected and enriched by
j the enormous taxes which were levied upon the labor of the
country for their advantage.
Imitating this foreign policy, the first step in establishing
the new system in the United Slates was ttie creation of a
| national bar.k. Not foreseeing the dangerous power and
j countless evils which such au institution might entail on the
, country, nor perceiving the connexion which it was designed
| to form between tbe bank and the other branches of the mis­
I called ""American system,"" l>u* fwlinu the embarrassments
! of the Treasury, and of tbe business of the country, conss­
. quent upon the war, som?* of our statesmen who had held
| different and sounder views were induced to yiekl their seru­
i pies, and, indeed, settled convictions of its unconstitutionality,
and to give it their sanction, as an expedient which they vain­
&lt; ly hoped might produce relief. It was a most unfortunate
) error, as the subsequent hisUry and final catastrophe of that
dangerous and corrupt institution have abundantly proved.
The bank, with its numerous branches ramified into the States,
l sooo brought many of the active p olitical and commercia' men
j in different sections of the country into the relation of debtors
to it and dependants upon it for pecuniaiy favors; thus dif­
I fusing throughout the mass of society a great number of in­
dividuals of power and influence to give tone to public opinion,
and to act in concert in cases oi emergency. The corrupt
' {tower of such a political engine is no longer a matter of
J speculation, having been displayed in numerous instance*,
but most signally in the political struggles of lN32-\J-'4, in
[ opposition to the public will represented by a fearless and pa­
I triotic Prt sident. '
But the hank was but one branch of tbe new system. A
public debt of more toan one hundred and twenty millions of
dollars ex sted ; and it is not to be disguised that tnanv of the
authors of tbe new system did not regard its speedy |>syment
as essential to tbe public prosperity, but looked upon its con­
j ttnuance as no national evd. Wfctlet tbe debt exi?ted it fur­
j nished aliment to the national bank, and rendered increased
! taxation necessary to tbe amount of ibe interest, exceeding
j seven millions of dollars annually.
This operated in harioony with the next branch of ihe new
system, which ws? a fciph protective tariff This was to
afford bounties to favored classes and particular pursuits, at
| tbe expense of all ethers. A proposition to lax the whol&lt;;
people for the purpose of enriching a few was too monstrous
' to be openly made. Tbe scheme was, there tote, veiled un- j
j der the plausible but ifcjjjsive pretext of a measure to protect
; ""home industry j"" ano many of our people were, lor a time,
led to brlieve th it a tax which in the main fell upon labor was
for the benefit of the laborer who paid it. This brsnch of tbe
i system involved a partneiship between tbe Government and
the favored classes?the former receiving the proceed* of the I
tax imposed on articles imported, and tbe latter the increased
price of similar articles produced at home, caused by such
tax. It is obvious that the portion to be received by tbe favor- j
ed clasaes would, as a general rule, be increased in proportion
to the increase of the rates ol tax imposed, and diminished as
those rates were reduced to the revenue standard required by
tbe wants of the Government. The rates required to produce
a entfie ert reveni-e for the ordinary eipenditurea of Govern­
ment, lor neces?s,y pu-poees, w-e not likely to give to the
privste partners in this scheme profits sufficient to satisfy their
cupidity, and hence a variety of expedients and pretexts were
resorted to for the purpose cf enlarging the expenditures, and |
thereby creating a necessity for keeping up a bigb protective
tariff, lite iflectof this policy was to interpose artificial re­
strictions upon the natural course ef tbe business and trade of !
tbe country, and to advance the interests of Urge cspitalists
and monopolists, at tbe expense of tbe great mass of the peo­
ple, who were taxed to increase their weslth.
Another branch of (his system wss a comprehensive scheme
of internal improvements, capable of indefinite enlargement,
ami sufficient to swallow up as many millions annually as (
could be exacted from the foreign commerce of the country, j
This was a convenient and necessary adjunct of the protective
tariff It was to be the greit abs roont of anv surplus wbi- h i
might at any time accumulato in the Treasury, and of the
taxes levied on the people, not for necessary revenue purposes,
but for tbe avowed obj.ct of affording piotection to the favored
classes.
Auxiliary to the same end, if it was not an essential part of
the system itsel', was the scheme which, at a later period, ob­
tained for distributing the proceeds of the sales of the public
lands among the States. Other expedients were devised to j
take money out of the Treasury, and prevent its coming in
from any other source than the protective tariff. The authors !
and supporters of the system were the advocates of tbe largesi
expenditures, whether for necessary or useful purposes or not,
because tbe Isiger the expenditures the grester was the pre­
text for high taxes in the form ol protective duties.
These several measures were sustained by popular names
and plausible arguments, by which thousands were deluded.
The bank was represented to be an indispensable fiscal agent |
for the Government: waa to equalize exchangee, and to regu- j
late and furnish a sound currency, always and every where of
upiform value. The protective tariff"" was to give employment
to ""American labor"" at advanced prices ; was to protect
"" home industry,"" and famish a steady market for the farmer.
Internal improvements were to bring trade into every neigh­
borhood and enhance the value of every man's property. The
distribution of the land money was to enrich the States, finish
their public works, plant schools throughout their borders,
and relieve them from taxation. Hut the fact that for every
dollar taken out .of the Treasury for these objects a much lar­

ger sum wai trannerred from the pocktU of the people to the .
favored classes wan carofully concealed, as was also the ten­
dency if not lfie ultimate design of the s^btem to huild up en i
arirtociacy of weti'th, to control the masses of society, anJ
monopolize the political power of the country.
i 1 he several branches of this system were sa intimately 1
blended together that in their ojieration each (sustained and
strengthened the others, i'heir joint operation was to add
new hurdt'ps of tuiation and to encourage a largely increased
an 1 waa'elul exp&lt; ndituie of public money, it was the in- I
tereat of the bank that the revenue collected and the disburse­
ment* made by the Government should bo large, because, be- |
ing the depository of the public money, the larger the amount j
the greater would iw the bank profit by its use. It was the
interest of the fat ired classes, who were enriched by the pro­
tective turifi, to hive the raits of that protection as high as
possib.c j tor the higher those rates the greater would be their
advantage. It wis the interest of the people of all those sec­
tions and locality who expected to be benefited by expendi­
tures tor internal improvements that the amount collected!
should be as larj- as possible, to the end that the sum disburs- !
ed might also be the larger. The .States, being the beneficia- ?
ries in the distri bution of the I md money, had an interest in i
having the rates of tax imposed by the protective tariff large !
enough to yieid i sufficient revenue from that souico to meet
the want* of th Government, without disturbing or taking
from them tho land Und, so that ouch of the branches consti­
tuting the systcn had a common interest in swe.ling the pub­
lie expenditure-. They had a direct interest in maintaining
