While teething,- she was^_, affected with consumption of 'the boWels, congestion of the lungs, and bronchitis; and four years ago she suffered from-- a ?'aevereijaE-tack of typhoid fever and yellow' jaundice.

Then she used- to suffer from a- female complaint, .which pulled her down to a skeleton. Eventually; when the girl' was taken away from school::oh account of her' declining condition, 'Mrs. Groves' consulted several doctors,- who ' 'gave -;rprescriptIons, but the medicine - afforded) no -permanent relief. Then, when .a. well-known specialist was in Newcastle, the girl was taken to him. He said she was suffering from an ulcerated liver, and would -die 'if not put- under his treatment, at a cost of Â£14 10s. ; ? Mrs. Groves was not . prepared tp - pay this amount, and the, specialist' then undertook to treat tlie girl' for three months for Â£4,' with the understanding that he would be paid the full amount :if . he effected a complete cure. In the , meantime, ho^'eyer, , Mrs. Groves read several personal testimonies regarding the action of Bile Beans on the liver, and she tried' them for her child in preference to the specialist's treatment, so she bought.a-.box of the. Beans. This was four months ago, _ and after the first two doses Mrs. Groves said she noticed her daughter beginning- to eat better. Then the child began to .improve in spirits, and seemed to take a pleasure in doing little things about the. hquse. When night .came on the girl was ready, for bed, and could, sleen well. After a while .her appetite- so far improved that she could 'eat with relish in the morningâ€” a meal which she had seldom partaken of,'. even when. not'. at her worst, for. many; a time 'the sir!, . went; to. school with nothing but a, glass of water in her stomach. The' improvement . went on and on, until the girl, is now apparently sound and well, and is a picture of health, having put on 141b in weight since 'com-, mencing with the Bile Beans four months' ago. She is now again attending the  Adamstown Public 'School, 'and is able to play about with the other children as If nothing had been the matter. 'This is the result of talcing a short ' course of Bile Beans after a patient has -been practically given up by - medical men, for airs.

Wilson &amp; Co., chemÂ_ists, formerly of this city, gave our reportÂ_er yesterday a bit of thrilling personal exÂ_perience in this line.""I have crawled over red hot bars of Ironand coals of fire,"" he said, ""in my agonyduring an opium frenzy.

I was then eating over thirtygrains of opium daily."""" How did you contract the habit !"""" Excessive business cares broke me downand my doctor prescribed opium 1 That isthe way nine-teuths of cases commence.When I determined to stop, however, Ifound I could ttot do it.""You may be surprised to know,"" hesaid, 4that two-fifths of the slaves of morÂ_phine and opium are physicians. Many ofthese I met. We studied our cases careÂ_fully. We found out what the organs werein which the appetite was developed andsustained; that no victim was free from ademoralized condition of those organs; thatthe hope of a cure depended entirely upon thedegree of vigor vshich could be imparted tothem. I have seen patients, while undergoÂ_ing treatment, compelled toresortto opiumagain to deaden the horrible pain in thoseorgans. I marvel how I ever escaped.""""Do you mean to say, Mr. Wilson, thatvou have conquered the nabitl""""Indeed I have.""Do you object to telling me how?"""" Ko, sir. Studying the matter with sevÂ_eral opium-eating physicians, we becamesatisfied that the appetite for opium waslocated in the kidneys and liver. Our nextobject was to . find a specific for restoringthose organs to health. The physicians,much against their code, addressed theirattention to a certain remedy and becamethoroughly convinced on ' its scientificmerits alone that it was the only one thatcould be relied upon iu every case of disÂ_ordered kidneys and liver. I thereuponbegan using it and, supplementing it withmy own special treatment, finally got fullyover the habit. I may say that the mostimportant part of the treatment is to getthose organs first into good working condiÂ_tion, for in them the appetite originatesand is sustained, and in them over ninetypercent of all other human ailments origÂ_inate."""" For the last seven years this positionhas been taken by the proprietors of thatremedy and finally it is oecoming an acÂ_knowledged scientific truth among themedical profession; many of them, howÂ_ever, do not openly acknowledge it, andyet, knowing they ""have no other scientificspecific, their code not allowing them touse it, they buy it upon tho quiet and preÂ_scribe it in their own bottles.""""As I said before, tho opium and morÂ_phine habits can never be cured until theappetite for them is routed out of the kidÂ_neys and liver. I have tried everythingexperimented with everything anil as theresult of my studies and investigation, Ican say I know nothing can accomplish thisresult ""but Warner's sufe cure.""""Have others tried your treatment!""""Yes, sir, many; and all who have folÂ_lowed it fully have recovered. Several ofthem who did not first treat their kidneysand liver for six or eight weeks, as I adÂ_vised them, completely failed. This formof treatment is always insisted upon forall patients, whether treated by mail or atthe Loveland OpiuM Institute, and suppleÂ_mented by our special private treatment,it always cures.""Mr. Wilson stands very high whereverknown. His experience is only anotherproof of tho wonderful and conceded powerof Warner's safe cure over all diseases ofthe kidneys, liver and blood, and the disÂ_eases caused by derangements of thoseorgans. We may nay that it is very flatterÂ_ing to the proprietors of Warner's safecure that it has received the highest mediÂ_cal endorsement and, after persistentstudy, it is admitted by scientists thatthere is nothing in materia medica for therestoration of those great organs thatequals it in power.

Sir True, of 13 Bligh-street Sydney, could not say enough ia. favor of Dr. Williams' Pink Pill* for Pale People. We tad beard so through one of the many channels bv which information reaches us, and determined once against to investigate and so ascertain whether the facts would substantiate the report, and also to learn what Mr. Trae's ailments had been. .?;*' ' You must know,' said Mr. True, explanatorily, ' that for fonrteeu jears I was in the employ of the Singer Sewing Machine Company, and only left them three or four weeks ago. Amongst other duties it was mine to drive machines around for delivery to customers. I do not know when, my trouble first came upon me, but this I know, that a peculiar heavy leaden feeling on the chest got hold of me. It was always there, never leaving me. ' I felt terribly des* pondent, the sensation being as though I were working under oppression, and were craving for a chance to assert myself. I think my trouble, severe indigestion, was due to a great extent to the irregularity with which I took my midday meal It very often happened that at the dinner hour I was miles : away in some distant 6uburb delivering machines. Consequently I had to put up with whatever I could get at the nearest restaurant, and this often resolved itself into nothing at all. I believe it must have been this unorthodox exchange for a square meal- that began the whole trouble. In addition to the heavy oppression at my chest that I before spoke of. I began. . to experience a blurr in my vision, ? and sometimes a sudden and slight '. dizziness seized me. I also began to have sleepless and uneasy nights, and nausea in tha morning. Sometimes I couldn't eat at all, and at other times I ate prodigiously. On such : latter occasions the feeling of an immovable -weight on my chest increased to a sensation of acute pain. Bat ail this food did me no . good. It simply didn't digest, and I grew thinner and thinner daily. During my younger days I was an. officer on board ship, and the ruddy and healthy complexion I then at- ' tained now gave way to a leaden and billions-looking pallor. I -went to a first class Sydney physician. Â£ ' paid him a guinea, and he gave me a prescription, but would not com- ; mit himself as to the nature of my- . case, nor as to the chances of my [ recovery. I took the prescribed ' medicine by the pint but it had noeffect upon me. I felt I was in for i lifelong dyspepsia. I grew bo ill ' that I bad to resign my billet at. Singer's. The very day I left some! : one persuaded me to try Dr. Wfl.-. liams' Pink Pills for Pale People, II* didn't believe in patent medicines, f but I tried them in a sort of despar-4 ation. I wanted a chance, I took the pills in the prescribed manneiv; and ere long a difference wasnotieeable ; tbe oppression -on my . chest was decidedly less ; it seemed ' as it were to be looser and more moveable. I took more pills and began to enjoy my food, which X hadn't done for a long time. X continued and in a short time (to make a long story short) I was. cured as you see me now.' Dr. Williams' Pink Pills have cured numerous cases of. paralysis,., locomotor ataxia, spinal disease,; rheumatism, and sciatica ; also diseases arising from impoverished and vitiated humors of the blood, which cause scrofula, rickets, chronic erysipelas, consumption of of the bowels and 3nngS, angpyni^ pale and sallow complexion, general mascular weakness, loss of appetite1 palpitations, pains in the back,' nervous headache, early decay, all forms of female ?weakness, and. hysteria. These pills are not a purgative. They are genuine only ' ?with tbe full name, Dr. WilliamsPink Pills for Pale People, and are : sold by chemists and by Dr. Wil* iiams' Medicine Company Perth, W. A., who will forward (post paid) on receipt of stamps or post order, one box for 3s., or half* dozen for : for 15s. 9d. They are unrivalled as a tonic for both sexes. I was never better in my life, and can eat like a horse, and, what is more, digest it too. I've saved a bit of money, and intend, in the course of a month or two, to go to the famous Klondyke goldfields to trv my luck. I shall take a large parcel of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People , with me, for I think that damper and bacon, which, seem likely to be the chief fare of the miners, will be productive of indigestion.

The word '* excruciating"" comes from crux a cross, and signifies an intensity of agony comparable only to that endured by one who undergoes the barbarous crucifixion. There are some diseases whicii, for a time, cause pain of this acute and formidable nature. To find a relief for it when possible, is at once the impulse of bumaoity and the studious desire of - cience. Two brief examples &lt;nÂ»y indicate what success is attending the efforc to both comfort &amp;r>d cure cases of this kind. "" Nearly all my life,"" writes an intelligent woman, ""I have born the burden of what appeared to be incurable illness. I always felt heavy, weary and tired. My appetite was poor, and after eating I had a cruel pain at my chest and between the shoulders. Frequently the p*in was so intense that I was impelled to loose my clothing and walk about the room. My nerves were disordered and impressible, and I was consequently, easily disquieted aind upset. My sleep was habitually bad, and I seemed mine the better for spending a night in bed. Eating . but little, my strength waned of necessity, aud I came to be very weak. For a long time I got about feebly and with difficulty. "" In August, 1887, I had an attack of rheumatic ^out, which gave me the most harrowing experience of my life. The complaint took its nsual course, and refused to yield to the ordinary treatment. Through the partial failure of the liver and kidneys dropsy set in and my legs and feet became puffed and swollen. I suffered excruciating pain and was confined, to my bed for thirteen weeks. Remedies-of every-description were tried but to tittle purpose. "" My brother, visiting me one day, said be had been cured of an attack of dropsy by a medicine called Mother Seigel's Syrnp. 1 got a bottle from Mr. Hewett, the chemist in Seven Sisters' Road, and after taking it felt a trifle easier. I continued taking it, and soon the pain and swelling abated. I could eat without pain or inconvenience, and by a few weeks' further use of the Syiup I was not only free from any local ailment, but felt better than I ever did in my life before. Since then I have enjoyed continuous good health, taking a doBe of Mother Seigel's Syrnp occasionally for some tranBieut indisposition. You are at liberty to publish my letter.

"" In January, 1892,"" writes another, "" I had an attack of influenza, and was confined to my bed for eighteen weeks thereafter. Subsequently I was very weak, and could get up no strength. What little food I forced down (having no appetite) gave me excrudaiing pain, so that I was afraid to eat. I came to be exceedingly weak and had fre, quent attacks of dizziuess. I was worn almost to a skeleton, and none thought I would recover. ""In June, 1892, Mr. Smith, a friend of ours, recommended me to try Mother Seigel's Syrup, which I at once procured of Mr. George Conjabe, the chemist in Hncknall, After taking it for only one week I felt greatly benefited. I could eat better, and food agreed with ine. Continuing with the Syrup I grew stronger and stronger, and soon felt even better than before I was at! tacked by the influenza. You are free to print this statement if you wish to do so. (Signed) (Mrs.) Ruth Halliday, 44, High Street, Hucknall Torkard, Nottingham, March 19th, 1895 "" Intense pain may or may. not indicate urgent danger to life, but it is hard to bear, and very exhausting just the same. In cases of rheumatic gout (Mrs. Rogers) the pain is caused by a poisonous acid in the tissues, originally produced by the decomposition of food in the stomachâ€”indigestion or dyspepsia. The same poison acting on the liver ^nd_ kidneys creates the other symptoms .mentioned! In the case of Mrs.: Halliday tae ailment was dyspepsia, which in the first pHce invited influenza, and then remained to totnent her.

There is no better known or more highlyrespected resident of Hill End, N.S.W, than Alderman B. Carver, J.P., who haB thrice filled the Mayoral chair, and was a delegate to the Mining Conference held in Sydney. in February, 1896. Alderman Carver has a daughter, Miss Addie Carver, likewise well-known in Kill End and district, she ' being a prominent menibef of the local musical circle, and in mnoh request as a vocalist. Miss Carver like countless thousands of others, has been cured of anajmia, that death-dealing complaint, by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Palo People. Miss Carver being interviewed said : â€” ' I did suffer intensely, and not only from anamina, but from neuralgia, too. The pains fromthe neuralgia were intense. They nhot through my headand face withoutintermission night and day. This I endured for a'bout five months. I conldn't sleep nor could I eat anything much. My appetite was 7ery poor, and I became very thin and languid. I nsed to dread the night, for I was so weak and dispirited that I couldn't sleep, and in the morning I roBejust as weary as ever, and during the whole day I used to sit with my head bandaged up, or else resting on the couch. I tried a great many remedies, but they were of no benefit to me. A doctor failed to relieve me. let alone cure me ; that was reserved for Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People. One day a lady friend, who lived near, advised me to try them, as they had cured her niece of a complaint exactly similar to mine. I purchased a few boxes from the local storekeeper. The effect was marvellous: About a fortnight after I started taking them the neuralgia completely left me, my appetite returned, and I slept better. I continued the treatment fer a little longer and every day improved with it, until at length, the;old, weary, worn-out feeling left me ; the blood returned to my face, and I regained my lost condition, and I am now as well as ever I was in my life.' A special reporter visited Mr. -J. Batchelor farmer, Hunter River, N.S.W., and this is tvhat that gentleman told him : â€” ' I am sixty-five, and had been resident in this district 12 years. About six years ago, all my energy seemed to gradually desert me. I suffered acutely and constantly from pains in my limbs, lost my appetite, and for months at a stretch I did not know what it was to get a good night's sleep. ' General debility had set in. The very lightest work became beyond me, and I could do nothing but sit at my window and content myself by watching the others work thefarm. I gave up all hope of ever being able to do any more work, and almost believed that every vreek which commenced would be my last. I tried innumerable socalled cures, and swallowed a fearful quantity of medical compounds ; but beyond giving me temporary relief occasionally, none did me any good. I happened to read in the newspaper some wonderful cures effected by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Palo People; and I determined to give them a trial. After taking the first box, I felt considerably i relieved ; and bo marked, was the improvement I noticed in my strength that I decided to continue their use. I did so, and up to the present time I have taken fire, boxes. My inability has all disappeared, and I am pleased to say that today;! nm as strong and hearty as I was in my life. It iB no trouble to me to do a day's farm work now, and I feel quite equal to the taBk of walking at least thirty miles a day.

Wehave also tried the use of almost allthe known remedies for catarrh, withno more success than temporary relief.Many nights have we laid awake tohold her mouth open to keep her fromstrangling. Her hearing had also beÂ_come affected. We were afraid thatshe never would recover. We havenow used six bottles of Hall's CatarrhCure and we believe Nellie to beentirely cured. In a few days after commencing the use of it we noticed a deÂ_cided change for the better, and fromthat right along she has improved, until now she breathes as easily as anyone. She sleeps well and her hearing isperfectly (rood. We feel that the diseaseis entirely removed. We write thisunsolicited letter, feeling that it is dueyou, and with the hope that othersmay be benefitted in like manner. Wecan hardly realize that such a chancrecould be effected in so short a timeafter battling with the disease so long.We are still using the remedy at interÂ_vals, as it seems to build up her sysÂ_tem.

I stated my case toanother physician, and be advised me totake Ufa to teu drops of Maeeniis's solution of morphine, two or three times a day,for the weakness and distress in mystomach, and a blue pill every other- nigutto relieve the constipation, the morphineproduced such a deathly nausea tnat Icould not take it, and the blue pill failedto relieve my constipation.In this condition 1 passed nearlv a year.wholly unfit for business, while tbe effortto think was irksome and paihlul. Myblood became impoverished, and 1 sufferedfrom incapacity with an appalling sense ofmisery and ceiieial appreuension of coming evil. I passed sleepless nights and wastroubled with irregular action of the he-art,a constantly feverish condition and themost excruciatme tortures in my stomach.living for days cn rice water and gruel,and, indeed, the digestive functions seeniedto be entirely destroyed.It was uatural that while in this condition I should become hypochondrical andfearful suggestions of self-destruction ocÂ_casionally presented themselves. I experienced an insatiable desire for sleep,but on retiring would lie awake for a ldttgtime tormented with troubled renections.and wheu at last I did fall into an uneasyslumber of short duration, it was disturbedby horrid dreams. In this condition I deÂ_termined to take a trip to Europe, but inspite of all the attentions of physicians andchange of scene and climate, 1 did not imÂ_prove and so returned home wich no earthly hope of ever again being able to leavethe house.Among the numerous friends that calledon me was one who had been afflictedsomewhat similarly to myself, but whohad boeu restored to perfect health. Uponbis earnest recommendation I began thesame treatment ho bad employed but withlittle hope of being benefited. At first Iexperienced little, if any, relief, excepttnac is did not distress my stomach asother remedies or even food had done. Icontinued its use, however, and after thethird bottle could see a marked changefor the better, and now after the fifteenthbottle 1 am happy to state that 1 am againable to attend to my professional duties. Isleep well, nothing distresses me that Ieat, I go from day to day without a feelingof weariness or pain, indeed I am a wellman, and wholly tn rough the influence ofH. H. Warner &amp; Co.'s 'i ippt-canoe. I conÂ_sider this remedy as taking the highestpossible rank in the treatment of all die-eases marked by debLity, loss of appetite,and all other symptoms of stomaca anddigestive disorders. It is overwhelminglysuperior to the tonics, bitters and dyspepÂ_sia cures of tbe day, and is certain to beso acknowledged by tbe public universally.Thousands of people to-day ai e going topremature graves with these serious disÂ_eases, that I have above described, and toall such I would say: ""Do no5 let ycurgood judgment be governed by your prejuÂ_dices, but give the above named remedya lair and patient trial, and I believe youwill nut only be rewarded by a perfectrestoration to health, but vou will also beconvinced that the medical professiondo s not possess all the knowledge there isembraced in medical science.""A.

He passed throughboth of these wars' without a seriouswound. The hardships, however, toldseriously on him, for. when the gripattacked him four years ago it. nearlykilled him. who can look on the inÂ_firmities of a veteran without a feelingof the deepest sympathy? His towns'people saw him confined to his house soprostrated with great nervousness thathe could not hold a knife and fork atthe table, scarcely able to walk too, andas he attempted it, he often stumbledand fell. They saw him treated by thebest talent to be had but still hesuffered on for four years, and gave upfinally in despair. One day, however,he was struck by the account of a curewhich had been effeoted by the use ofDrt Williams' Pink Pills. He lmÂ_mediatly ordered a box and commencedtaking them. He says he was greatlyrelieved within three days time. ' Theblood found its way to his fingers andhis hands which had been palsiedassumed a natural color, and he wassoon enabled to use his knife and forkat the table. . He has recovered hisstrength to such an extent that he isable to chop wood, shock corn and dohis regular work about his home. Henow says he can not only walk toWoodstock, but can walk across themountains. He is able to lift up afifty-two pound weight with one handand says he does not know what Dr.Williams' Pink Pills have done forothers, but knows that they have donea great work for him.' .He was in town last Monday, courtday, and was loud in his praises of themedicine that had given so great relief.He purohased another box and took ithome with him. Mr. : Molnturff iswilling to make affidavit to these facts., The proprietors of Dr. Williams'Pink Pills state that they are not patentmedicine but a prescription used formany years by an eminent practitionerwho produced the most wonderful results with them, curing all forms ofweakness arising from a watery condition of the blood or shattered nerves,two fruitful causes of almost every ilfto which flesh is heir. . The pills arealso a specific for the troubles peculiarto females, such as suppressions, allforms of weakness, chronio constipation, bearing down pains, etc. , and inthe case of men will give speedy reliefand effect a permanent cure in all casesarising from mental worry, overwork,or exoesses of whatever nature. Theyare entirely harmless and can be givento weak and sickly children with thegreatest good and without the slightestdanger.

We underÂ_stand from the eastern papers, thereis in the ports of India at this time,an abundance of grain for the reliefof the famine in India, but that thefinancial policy that England givesits people there, leaves the people I of other foods. Such a preparationwithout money with which to supply virtually rests the tired digestive orÂ_gans, thereby restoring them to their Inatural strength.The Digestive Cordial, as preparedby the 8hakers of Mount Lebanon, isjust such a preparation, and a single10 cent bottle will convince you of itsvalue.

Hating bought a botile at Mr. Johnson's drug store, comÂ_menced uslnj it with, such nattering results that shecontinued its use, and after using only five bottles theimprovement In her health is so marked that shewishes all who are afflicted in like manner to know ofthis most valuable and reliable medicine; and she mostcheerfully recommends Hunt's Remedy to all, andespecially to females who are troubled with the, comÂ_plaints peculiar to the sex.A FAMILY BLESSING?Under date of May 10. 13S3, we have received the following information from Mr. Lorenzo Lombard, of 13Charles street. Portland, Me. Mr. Lombard says:""For several years past I have been troubled withsevere backache and pains in the side, and when Iwould lie down I could not rest well, as It seemed imÂ_possible for me to get Into an easy position; and myaches and pains increased constantly to such an extentthat I became convinced that I had a disease of the kidÂ_neys fastened to me, and after having used doctorsprescriptions and many of the so-called cures withoutgetting any benefit, I was persuaded by a near neighÂ_bor, Mr. Jones, to try Hunt's Remedy, as himself andwife had been greatly benefited by its uses, and manyothers of our acquaintances spoke of its merits m thehighest terms. I decided to try It, and purchased abottle a Nlchpl's drug store, and as soon as 1 had takena few doses of It the pains In my back were relieved,and after taking three bottles my sldeache and lameback are cured, and I can truly testify that Hunt'sRemedy is an article of great merit, and will do all thatis claimed for it, and I know of many other people InPortland who have found a cure In n ant's Remedyafter all others failed to do any good, and I recomÂ_mend il to all who have kidney or liver disease, hopingthat th!s may be the means of relieving some suffererwho does not know of the merits of Hunt's Remedy.DR.

Many a woman,weeping for her dead son, bound up thewounds of his suffering comrades, rejoicingin their/\v\ IpÂ©: renewedstre neth,.i even while,i evenwisorrowinfor the onewho wasgone. Atthat timewas laidthe foundÂ_ation forthe world-On the Battlefield. famed orÂ_ganization known as the Woman's ReliefCorps, whose aid to the soldier of today,fighting against the world for a living, isno less notable than the heroism of theearly '60's.One of the most earnest members of thecorps at Byron, 111., is Mrs. James HouseÂ_weart, but illness once put a stop to heractive work. A year or so ago, when shewas nearing fifty years of age, the timewhen women must be most careful of theirstrength, Mrs. Houseweart was taken seriÂ_ously ill. The family physician told herthat she had reched a critical period of herlife, and must be very careful. His preÂ_scriptions and treatment didnot benefit her,and other treatment proved unavailing.At last Dr. William's Pink Pills for PalePeople wave brought to her notice, with inÂ_disputable evidence that they were helpfulin cases such as hers, and with renewedhope she tried the remedy. Last March shetook the first box of the pills, which gavemuch relief. She was determined to becured, and kept on with the medicine, unÂ_tile now eight boxes have been consumed,and she feels like a new woman.Mrs. Houseweart said:The BestSaddle Coat.l-Iliams' MedicJns Oo., Schenehave ""takenonly eight bosp.M, but I have been improvÂ_ing since I took the first dose.

Ohio.â€”(Special.) - Thistown Is greatly exercised over the reÂ_markable rescue of Sheriff R. P. WilÂ_kins from one of the worst forms ofslavery known to man. He has nowfully recovered from the results of hisexperience, and talks freely and grateÂ_fully of his deliverer. In an Interview jto-day he said: ""I have been a perfect jslave to tobacco for over twenty-fiveyears; I smoked from twelve to fifteencigars a day. November 4th, . last, I !bought my first box of No-To-Bac fromAnderson &amp; Cramer. I had little faith,and to my great surprise, after usingpart of the third box, I was completely.cured.and did not have the least deÂ_sire for tobacco. To-day I feel better,I [sleep* better, think better, and Ihave gained fifteen pounds In weight,and there Is not a day passes that Ido not recommend No-To-Bac to manyof the tobacco users who I know aredestroying their lives and vitality bythe use of the weed.""Further investigation revealed thefact that there are 500 people living inthis town and the surrounding countrywho have been cured by vNo-To-Bac.Anderson &amp; Cramer stated that theywere the first to start the good workhere, as Mr. Anderson termed it. ""Yes,we introduced No-To-Bac into this jtown about three years ago. The de- Iâ€¢mand at the start was very light, the ifolks had no faith in It, but we sold !to a few people, and to our great as- â€¢tonishment every one reported a cure.Since that time we have sold hundredsof boxes, and every one under a guarÂ_antee to cure or refund the money, and jstrange as It may seem, we have neverhad a call to refund money.""No-To-Bac not only relieves the nerÂ_vous irritation and makes the use oftobacco entirely unnecessary, hut atthe same time builds up and fortifiesthe general physical condition. As a jnatural invigorator and stimulant we Ibelieve there is no preparation in 'America to equal It.""The public should be warned, howÂ_ever, against the purchase of any ofthe many imitations on the market, asthe success of No-To-Bac has brought ;forth a host of counterfeiters and imiÂ_tators. The genuine No-To-Bac Is Imade by the Sterling Remedy Co., Chi- |cago, Montreal and New York, and Is isold under a guarantee to cure by all 'druggists, and every tablet haÂ« the Iword No-To-Bac plainly stamped !thereon."" jsir",ads,yes

Why, Â£ nothing, to be sure. % Now, if you will be good enough to read f ' what Mr. Hodgson says, I'll tell you what he Â£ and the clerk were alike in. First, though, H we will let our friend from Leeds have the f floor for three minutes. He says :â€” \ [Copy.] s, 'I, George Hodgson, of 17, Fraser-strcet, Â£ Stoney Rock Lane, Leeds, do solemnly and * ' sincerely declare as follows : â€” } ' For over twenty years I suffered from a % bad stomach and indigestion. I always felt % tired and laguid, and had a strange uneasy |t feeling at the pit of my stomach. I had a f foul taste in the mouth, particularly in the -morning. My appetite was poor, and after every meal I had great pain at the chest and sides. I was much troubled with sick headache, and I had often pain and weight at my ' forehead. A hacking cough troubled me j during the night and on rising in the morning, and I spat up a deal of thick phlegm. As time went on I became pale and emaciated, and got weak and nervous, and ; for twenty years I never felt well. I 1 struggled on with my work as best I could, but felt so exhausted that I had to lie down during my dinner hour, and also when I , reached home at night. / was always in pain, and what my sufferings were during 't those long years, no words can express. I i took all kinds of medicines I could tell of, \ and was under three doctors, but no medi- | cine that I took gave me more than tern- \ poiary relief. At last I became weary of ;! taking physic, and quite thought my ailment j was incurable. In February of 188S I got 1 very low and weak, for, added to my old | standing complaint I was iu such a state | with piles that I could neither sit ] nor lie down. The pain was almost | more than I could bear. It was like j a knife cutting me open, and perspiration \ would fairly run off me, so severe were my J sufferings. For six months I went on in this I way, getting weaker and weaker, and I | thought I was going to die. Just at this time I I took up a book that was left at my house, | and I read a case like mine having been | cured by a medicine called Mother Seigel's f Curative Syrup. I got a bottle from the | Co-operatives Stores, Burmantofts, and com- | menced taking it. After three or four doses | of the Syrup 1 found my food digested better i and I had less pain, and by continuing with f, the medicine I gradually gained strength. i By-and-by, as if by magic, all the pain from I the piles left me, and indigestion troubled | me 110 more. I have never ailed anything | since, although three years have elapsed, and | I never felt so well in all my life as I do 1 now. Seigel's Syrup has made a new man t: of me. I wish others to know what the , | medicine has done for me, and I give full ' I permission to the proprietors of it to make | what use they like of this statement, in the | hope that other sufferers may be benefited. r I am a tailor's presser, and have been in the f employ of a wholesale clothier in Quebec ^ Street, Leeds, for over eight years.

His announcement will do good â€” lots % of good â€” as there is a multitude of men and |j women tormented in the same way Mr. ' Hodgson was. Some have symptoms like ' his, and others have different ones, but they all signify the presence and power of the same old nuisance and scourge â€” indigestion and dyspepsia. , The reader takes notice, of course, of the form in which the forgoing statement is made â€” the form of a simple and solemn declaration, according to law, before a magistrate, the Mayor of Leeds.

ThePeople's Common Sense Medical AdÂ_viser,"" etc., etc.-I am aware that there is a popular and notaltogether unfounded prejudice against""patent medicines,""- owiDg to the smallamount f merit which many of them posÂ_sess. The' appellation ""patent medicine""does not apply to my remedies, as no patenthas ever been asked for or obtained nponthem, nor have they been nrged npon thepublic as ""eure-alis."" They are simplysome favorite prescriptions, which, in a veryextensive practice, have proved their supeÂ_rior remedial virtues in the cure of thediseases for which they are recommended.Every practicing physician has his favoriteremedies, which he ofteoest recommends oruses, because he has the greatest confidencein their virtues. The patient does not knowtheir composition. Even prescriptions areusually written in a language unintelligibleto any but the druggist. As much secrecyis employed as in the preparation of propriÂ_etary medicines. Does the fact that an arÂ_ticle is prepared by a process known only tothe mauuiacturfr render that article lessvaluable '! How many physicians know theelementary composition of the remedieswhich they employ,-some of which havenever been anulyzed? Few practitionersknow how Morphine, Quinine, Podophylhn,Lcptandrin, Pepsin or Chloroform are made,or bow nauseous drugs are transformed intopalatable elixirs, yet they do not hesitate toemploy them. Is it not inconsistent to use aprescription, the compoi-i-.ion of which isunknown to us, and discard another prepÂ_aration simply because it is accompanied bya printed statement of its properties, withdirections for its use?Some persons, while admitting that mymedicines are good pharmaceutical comÂ_pounds, object to them on the ground thatthey are too often nsed with insufficientjudgment I propose to obviate this difÂ_ficulty by enlightening the people as to thestructure and functions of their bodies, thecauses, character and symptoms of disease,and by indicating the proper and judiciousemployment of my medicines, together withsuch auxiliary treatment as may be necesÂ_sary.

Itseemed to him that he had seen that facebefore, partially obscured by the smokeof battle, and yet tins bright... andpleasant countenance oould not bethe same pale and death-like visage,-which he so dimlfy remembered. Butthe recollection, like Banquo's ghost,WOUld not ""down"" ftt ftnTnnmnn,hauntedhim the entire day. Onthedayfollowing he again saw. the same counÂ_tenance,and ventured to spec^k to its own*er. The instaiifc the two veterans heardeach other's groioes, that instant theyreorganized abd called each other bjname. TheM faces and forms hadchanged^ but t^eir voices w&amp;re the same.The man whon^ Captain Benson had reÂ_cognized wasltr. Wv K. S^ge, of St.JTohns, Mich., Â§rateran of the 23d^N. Y.Light Artillery '^nd both- members ofBurnside's famous expedition to NorthCarolina. After the first greetings wereover, Captain Bensom said:hardly seems possible, Sage, to seeyou in this condition, for I thought youmust have been dead long ago.""""Yes, I do not doubt it, for if I a&amp;not mistaken, when we last met I wasoccuping a couch in the hospital, a vicÂ_tim of ^Yellow Jack* in its worst form.""""1 remember. The war seems to havecaused more misery since its close thanwhen it was in progress,"" replied theCaptain. ""I meet old comrades freÂ_quently who are suffering terribly, notso much from old wounds as from themalarial poisons which ruined their conÂ_stitutions.""I think so myself. ""When the warclosed returned home and at times Iwould feel well, but every few weeksthat confounded 'all-gone* feeling would'come upon me again. My nervous sysÂ_tem, which was shattered in the service,failed me entirely and produced one ofthe worst possible cases of nervous dysÂ_pepsia. Most of the time I had no apÂ_petite then again I would become ravÂ_enously hungry, but the minute I satdown to eat I loathed food. Myskin was dry and parched, my.flesh loose and flabby. I could holdnothing on my stomach for days at atime, and what little I did eat failed toassimilate. I was easily fatigued mymind was depressed I was cross andirritable and many a night my heartwould pain me so I could not sleep, andwhen I did I hod horrid dreams andfrightful nightmares. Of course, thesethings came on one by one, each worsethan the other. My breath was foul,my tongue was coated, my teeth deÂ_cayed. I had terrific headaches whichwould leave my nervous system comÂ_pletely shattered. In fact my existencesince the war, has been a living death,from which I have often prayed for reÂ_lease.""""Couldn't the -old surgeon do you anygood?""""I wrote him and he treated me, butlike every other doctor, failed. Theyall said mj nerve was gone and withoutthat to build upon I could not get well.""When I was at my worst, piles of theseverest nature came upon me. Thenmy liver gave out and without the use ofcathartics could not move my bowelsat all. My blood, got like a stream offire and seemed literally to burn mealive.""""Well you might better have died inbattle, quick and without ceremony.""""How many times I have wislied Ihad died the day we captured NewÂ_borne!""""And yet you are now the picture ofhealth.""""And the picture is taken from life. Iam in perfect condition. Mv nerve toneis restored my stomach relnvigoratedmy flesh is hard and healthy in fact Iliave new blood, new energy and anewlease of life wholly as the result of usingWarner's Tippecanoe. This remarkablepreparation, which consider the finesttonic and stomach restorer in the'worldhas overcome all the evil influences ofmalaria, all the poison of the army, alltraces of dyspepsia, all mal-assimilationof food, and indeed made anew man ofme.""The captain remainedsilent for awhileevidently musing over his recollectionsof the past, when he again raised hishead he said""It would beagodsend if all the vetÂ_erans who have suffered so intensely aqdalso all others in the land who are enÂ_during so much misery could know ofyour experience, Sage, and the way bywhich you have been restored.""And that is why the above conversaÂ_tion is recounted.Cattle Wonted.Parties having cattle for sale of any class,please address, giving grade, numbers, age andprice.
