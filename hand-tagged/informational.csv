Almost all tho victims are of Polishnativity and Hcbrau extraction andmany of tho injured were taken to theirhomes by friends, rendering it almost,impossible to get a complete list at thistime.The theater, which is probably theoldest in tho city, was filled from pit todome with peoplo who had assembled tolisten to Hebrew opera, which has beengiven in tho old house twice a week fortho past mouth. Tho ticket ofiico reÂ­ceipts show that over 2,700 tickets hadbeen sold, when at 8 o'clock tho sale ofseats was stopped because there weronomore left. General admission ticketswere sold, however, after this, and it issupposed that there wero at least 3,000peoplo within tho walls when tho curÂ­tain went up on tho first act. As thocapacity of tho honso is less than 2,500tho density of the crowd may bo imÂ­agined.Ten minutes after tho curtain roso,one of tho attendants wont up to thosecond tier to light a gas jet which apÂ­peared to havo been extinguished. Ashe turned tho cock and upjilicd a matchtho light flared up and it was seen thatthere was no tip to tho burner. The jetwbb well down toward tho stage on tholeft side of tho houso in plain viow ofthe greater part of tho audience, but astho glare from it showed against thewall, some one in the gallery shouted:""Fire! Firo! Firo.""In an instant there was a madscramble for the door, in wliieh thewhole audience took part. Tho vanguard of tho terror-stricken multitudereached tho entrance on Front street,pushed on by tho howling, shriekingmob behind them. There, those in thoforemost rank were coinpellcd to turnto the right and to tho left to reach thedouble entrance way, built in tho formof storm doors. Passing through thesodoors, they reached u flight of steps,leading from each door, downward to alanding, from whence a bioad stainvayof moderate height would have earnedthem into tho htioet, and to safety.The Bteps leading from tho dconvuysare but about fivo feet high, but thelanding, at their baso is narrow. Downthese tho frightened peoplo hustledthemselves in the l'rigtottul strngglo toreach tho open air and to escape thocertain death they thought was behindthem.As tho crowds from tho two doom,one on the right, tho other on the lolt,reached the landing they met. Therewas a brief struggle, and then some duoJost liis or h'er tooling imd fell. In amoment the crowd, pushed with irreÂ­sistiblo force from the rear, crowdedupon tho prostrate form and began iuturn to stumble, reel and presently tofall prouo upon tho floor, unaor themynaus ot icet coming iiko a nerti oifrightened buffalo fiom bohiild. In lesstimo than it takes to tell it, tho landingwas packed 20 or 30 deep with tho pahicÂ­stricken multitude, unci tho hundredsbehind them were struggling over themto reach tho stieot.Tho tumult attracted an immensecrowd from tho outside, many of whomtried to gain entranco to tho theater,thus adding to tho confusion. A dozenpolicemen also attracted by tho shrieksof tho frightened crowd hurried to thescene, and using their clubs on thoseouteido, pushed through tho door ahdto the writhing mass on tho lahdhig.Among tho .first to reach them wasOfficer B. 3.

Referring",informational,yes51,17179988593,"the seconds of Prince Henri of OrÂ­leans to the direction of the encounter bya fifth party.The process-verbal then proceeds to de.scribe the encounter. It says that, in thefirst assault. Prince Henri was hit In theright breast, though the weapon did notpenetrate the thoras. On the strength ofthe report of the doctors, the seconds decided that the combat must go on. Thesecond assault was stopped because thecombatants came into close quarters. Inthe third assault the Count of Turin washit in the back of the right hand, but thewound was slight. In the fourth assaultthe umpire. Major Leontieff, declared thatthe sword of Prince Henri was bent, andstopped the engagement Jong enough tofurnish the prince with a new weapon. Inthe fifth assault the combatants again gotinto close quarters and were immediatelystopped. Prince Henri in a counter blow,being hit in the right lower region of theabdomen. The doctors on both sides ex.amined the wound and declared thatPrince Henri was rendered by it clearlyInferior to his antagonist. Major LeonÂ­tieff and M. Mourlchon proposed that thecombat be stopped, and this was done bycommon accord.While his wound was being dressedPrince Henri, raising himself upon theground, extended his hand to the Countof Turin, saying: ""Allow me, monseigÂ­neur, to shake hands with you."" Thecount extended his hand. The physicianspresent were Dr. Tounet and Dr. HartÂ­man on behalf of Prince Henri, and Dr.Carle on behalf of the Count of Turin.This account of the fighting was signedby the seconds.The details of the duel show that theencounter was very sharp and deterÂ­mined. Immediately upon the crossing ofswords. Prince Henri vigorously pressedhis adversary. The Count of Turin reÂ­treated to the limit of the ground andthen, resuming the offensive, touched hisopponent. The third and fourth assaultsended In long engagements within guard.The Temps says that the wound in theabdomen of Prince Henri Is serious, butnot alarming. Had the Count of Turin'ssteel gone half a centimeter deeper, theIntestines would have been perforated.After his wound had received a prelimiÂ­nary dressing. Prince Henri walked to hiscarriage unaided. The Count of Turin,accompanied by his seconds, left Parisfor Italy yesterday afternoon. He wasnot experiencing any special distressfrom his wounds.The meeting between the seconds waslong and stormy. The representatives ofPrince Henri stated in his behalf that hecould not withdraw his original asserÂ­tions, as he had written only the truthabout the Italian officers and was entirelywilling to give satisfaction to a represenÂ­tative Italian.The seconds of Prince Henri of Orleanswere R. Dolentoff, governor general ofthe equatorial provinces of Abyssinia, andM. Raoul Mourlchon. The Count ofTurin's seconds were General Count AvaÂ­gadro . de Quinto and the Marquis Carlodi Ginorl.The seconds made absolute privacy acondition, and said if a soul were presentexcept the principals, seconds and' doc-tors the fight should be stopped and theCount of Turin should return immediatelyto Italy and be followed by Prince Henrito fight it out there. For this reason,various places of meeting were men.tioned to mislead the Inquisitive, and theseconds on both sides changed Bleepingquarters during the night In order tothrow the newspaper correspondents, oftthe scent. ....EOME",informational,no250,34359870896,"Tbis ink has a flowingproperty peculiar to itself, ani does not corrode metallicpens as other ines.

The vessel was seenearly yesterday evening steaming towards the1Whn ab~2reast of thezBritish ironclad Anson,fla-gship of Rear-Admiral Jones, second incommelnd of the Channel S5quadron, whichwas lying at anchor in the hay off RaggedStaff at 'the south end of the town, near' theÂ­LParade and Public Garden, the Utopia -was seento stagg1er as if unable to make headway againstthe strong current running out at tho time. Ina moment the fierce gale combined with thisLcurrent swvept the ill-fated vessel across theLbows of the Anson, which is a twin screw firatÂ­class armour-clad with aformidlable ram. Thisram cut bodily into the steamer, and she thendrifted before the wind and sea until the rapidinrush of water made her bog-in to settle down,which happened only five mainutos after theifirst shock.Boats 'were at once lowered from the Ansonand other vessels of the British squadron, aswell as from the Swedish war-ship Freya andthe cable-ship Amber, while the ironcladsturned their electric search lig.hts towards thewreck, 'to assist the rescuers in their difficulttash, for by this time the daylight had almostcompletely faded. The scene at this maoment;Lwas one -which could never be forgotten.Crowds of. people collected at South Port andalong the Parade in the greatest excitement,'but little could ho seen from shore save thedark formns of the ironolads looming throughthe twililht, and the -white rays of the searchlights falling upon the foam crests and driving~spindrift.The shirieking of the poor creatures on boardthe Utopia was heartrending, being only toodistinctly audible abovo the noise of the galeand the quick sharp orders shouted now andthen by the rescuers. The idea of ninehundred fellow creatures thus perishingwithin sight and sound of shore cast agloom over the -whole towen. The sea wasrunning so heavily that the boats could not apÂ­ Epreach the wreck with any hope of taking off'those on board, and -were compelled to lie toleeward, picking up the people as they wereswept off the decks into the sea. As theUtopia's bows began to sink, a terrible scenewas indistinctly witnessed from the boats. Thoseon board the wreck rushed forward struggling(with each other for life, and fighting their wayYup hefor rgging. Twenty minutes later, thetforecast-le disappeared beneath the surface, scarrying down the crowds of unf ortunrate beings I-who had not darod to jump off in the hope Of Ibeing picked up by the hosts, and bed failed in Ctheir efforts to takec refuge in the rigging.The wind and rain were so blindiiTg that Iscarcely anything could be seen by the rescuersIbeyond a confused, struggling mass of living 2beings inextricably mixed up with wreckage. tThose who had succeeded in taking refuge in I?the main rigging -were rescued by a steamtpinnace, but the work of taking them off was1not finished until eleven o'clock at niaht. The 0last persons rescued were so exha~stcd that fthey could not get into the boats, and it wasIfound necessary for the blue-jackets to disÂ­ '9erabark and clamber up tba -shrouds in order to cpass the peer benumbed creatures down into the Iboats. The crews, both Swedes and British,worked with such pluck, and vigour that it isimpossible to say who did the more daring actsor showed the greatest activity and courage.Unfortunately, the work of saving the shipÂ­wrecked people -was 'not unattended by fatalitiesto the rescuers themselves. A steam pinnacebelonging to H.lX1. cruiser Imrnortalit6 fouledher screw and drifted on to the rocks. Twosea-men were drowned, but the remainder of hercrew were rescued. tTwenty-four members of the Utopia's crew iiwere saved, including the captain, ship's doctor, atwo officers; one engineer, and one steward. eThis leaves thirty-six to be accounted for, all ofwhom, it is fearod, were drowned.

Last night matters came to a crisis.Culacabbage, it is charge, and his followÂ­ers, to the number of several hundred,arming themselves with guns, revolvers,knives, axes and clubs, marched to CavenÂ­dish's hotel, where several hundred of theirenemies were celebrating pay day. TheCavendish men ascertained that their foeswere marching on them, and, arming themÂ­selves hurriedly, awaited their arrival.After a demonstrative march, the CulacabÂ­bage contingent arrived and stormed thesaloon.Then a bloody battle ensued: The menfought like demons.

Thereare two ways of removing it. One is bykneading it in'water or brine, and the otherby kneading it without -water. Oiie"" iscalled "" washing"" and the other ""working.""The-former removes it much 'more rapidlythan the latter;- As to which-is the betterway there are conflicting opinions. Some.would.not.have their butter washed on anyaccount, because'they believe'the flavor audthe -keeping - of the butter are thereby inÂ­jured; while others are equally tenacious inthe use of water, and believe as firmly that'the flavor and keeping are improved bywashing."""" The flavor of butter which has beenwashed, is different from that which hasnot been washed. The difference betweenwashed and unwashed butter is analagousto the difference between clarified and unÂ­clarified sugar. The former consists of puresaccharine matter, the latter of sugar andsome albuminous and flavoring matterswhich were contained in the juice of thecane minghkl with it, which give a flavorin addition to that of the sugar. Brownsugar, though lessÂ­ sweet, has more flavorthan clarified sugar. When unwashed, thereis always a little buttermilk and sugar adÂ­hering to the butter that give it a peculiarflavor in addition to that of pure butter,which many people like when it is new.Washing removes all this foreign matterandleaves only the taste of the butter pure andsimple. Those who prefer the taste of thebutter to the foreign ingredients mixed withit, like the washed butter best."" The assertion is often made, and manypeople believe, that, water washes out theflavor of the butter, but it only cleanses thebutter of the buttermilk, sugar and milkacid, which may adhere to it, just as clariÂ­fying sugar removes from it the foreignmatters which modify its true flavor. Theflavor of butter consists of fatty matterswhich do not combine with water at all, andcannot therefore be washed away by it."" The effect of washing upon the keepingquality of butter depends upon the purityof the water with which the washing is done.If the water contains no foreign matter thatwill affect the butter, it will keep better forwashing the buttermilk out than by workingit out. But if the wateris hard from thethe presence of lime, or contains anythingthat could injure the butter by contact withit, washing becomes an injury instead of abenefit to its keeping. Nothing but thebest and purest water should be us edaboutbutter. Very hard water is always objecÂ­tionable. It is not, however, so objectionaÂ­ble as the water from wells, which containmuddy sediment so full of organic matter asto become tainted. Water standing oversuch mud takes in the taint, and if used forwashing butter, is sure to injure it for longkeeping. There is a good deal of well watÂ­er, otherwise good, which is rendered e hÂ­tirely unfit for using about butter by reasonof sediment at the bottom of the well.""This is frequently the case in dry timeswhen wells get low and the influx small,and the water in them is too slowly changed.I once saw a lot of nice butter spoiled enÂ­tirely for table use, in twenty-four hours, bybeing washed with water from a well whichwas low, and the sediment in its bottomhadbecome affected.

Someof the passengers, however, secured ahand car and rode through the flames toHinckley, taking the north bound trainthis side of there and returning on itto this city.On their ride on the hand car theycounted twenty-seven dead bodies alongthe line of the railroad. Seventeen werediscovered at Hinckley during the mornÂ­ing, and twenty-one others have beenfound up to 1 o'clock.They say that the people of Hinckleyran to the woodsÂ­ when their housescaught fire; and as the timber afterwardsburned it is more than probable thatgreat n-umbersT pcrlhe .The most conservative estimate of thedead is 200.The whole country around Hinckley ison fire, and the full extent of the disastercannot be learned for a day or two.It is feared that several other townsnave suffered a like fate. Millaca calledfor help yesterday afternoon, and therelief train from St. Cloud was unableto get beyond Bridgeman. Nothing furÂ­ther has yet been received from Stillaca,and how much may have been the sufÂ­fering cannot at this time be known.Bridgeman was apparently safe after ahard fight. The flames, however, werevery threatening around that town, andas it is very dry all over that part of thestate the worst is feared.The party thatCAMIE THROUoG THE. FIREsaround Hinckley in the hand car sufferedseverely from burns. Their injuries, howÂ­ever, will not. prove fatal. They tellmany sad' stories of what they saw. Onewoman had evidently tried to save herfive chlldren and was overtaken by theflames, and the whole family perishedclose to the railroad track.Another case was where a mother,seeing her house In flames, ran in to saveher child, her husband also following'her, and the walls of the 'house cavedIn before they could get out.The pAssenger train from Duluth onwhich these men wereo is in ashes andthe rest of the passengers have takenrefuge In a marsh near.

The townwas built of wood, the school'hase, erectÂ­el last'year at a cost of $10,000, and oneÂ­half the Duluth roundhouse being the onlybrick structures. in the city. By one ofthose peculiar freaks for which there is noaccounting, the Eastern Minnesota roundÂ­house and water tank, on the southwestÂ­er edge of trhe town, almost in thewoods, escaped the flames-a circumstancethe more remarkable from the fact that Itstood directly in the path of the flames,which seem to have jumped it as cleanlyas if playing leap frog. All yesterday foreÂ­noon the townspeople were apprehensive.The smoke rolling up from the south toldu story unmlatakably plain to those accusÂ­tomed to a wooded section. The fire keptudvancing, fanned by the wind, which wasblowing a gale. About 11 o'clock the firecompany got out their engine and laid an1o00 feet line of hose to the southern outÂ­skirts of the town. The hose was all tooshort for the nature of protection desired,and a telegram -was sent to Rush City formore. Five hundred feet was sent, but Itnever reached Hinckley. The main part ofthe village lies in the north fork mude bythe Duluth and Eastern' tracks. On thewest side of the Duluth tracks were afew small houses belonging to the railwayemployes. Attention was mainly direotedto keeping the fire away from them, asthe main part of the town was built insolidly just across the track. The intenseheat would develop a veritable whirlwindof flame that actually twisted off poplartrees several inches in thickness and carÂ­ried huge blazing firebrands high in theair, carrying them forward for from fortyto eighty rods. The fire first struck HlnakÂ­ley on the east side of the Duluth track,and the braove fire fighters for the firsttime gave up the unequal battle and alÂ­ready too late in many instances, turnedtheir attention to personal safety.The Eastern MinnesotaTRAIN FROM T'ihE Souahad just come in, and the people of thepanic-Stricken city flocked to it for safety.A number of boxcars were coupled on andfllod and covered with men, women andchildren. Some were bareheaded, somewere ooatless, some few clutched a pitifulbundle of the more predtous of-their portÂ­able possessions. oamilies were sepaÂ­rated,, children joitnei the throng and leftparents. In all there were a motley crewOf ehont 4.50 ormor ere paupt.The train pulled out just ahead of thefire-and succeeded in ultimately reaohiugDuluth.This circumstance, while fortunate ina degree that cannout be estimated, basmade the confusion greater, for it is notknosrn who escaped in this way, endmany people are reported dead who maybe in sfety. Had not this number orpeople, largely women and children, leftthe doomed city when they did, the lossof life would have Ilcreased in a geoÂ­aetrical ratio, for their presence wouldhave added immeasurably to the eubseÂ­quent confuslon. About the same hourthe accommodation traitsl on the HlnckÂ­ley and St. Cloudl branch left for thelatter place with autout twenty-five pasÂ­sengers. Its tith lay directly scross thepath of the fire, and their situationspeedlly became desperate. The tlieswere burning, the rlls were wanrplingand tres~te were sagging under hitrain. Tie smoke tad incre.sed 0othat the engineer sos huelp:ess. He coulstnot see the train behind him. Burningtrees lay scroa tite truck alid were beÂ­ing tossed .aslde iby the engine. SinlÂ­denly the track gave way and the traintoppled off 'to one side. No one was inÂ­jured, and they pre.sed on to PokoÂ­gama station, a fes ruinS ahead. Bit afew feet In front of the engine was dllÂ­covered a gorge slxyy feet widle antiforty feel deep, u-here the trestle hadbeen burned away. They suceeded Inreuching the clearing about the stationand escaped with a few burns anaIbruises. There wrce burned along thetrack, however, fouir or five people, inÂ­cluding Dr. Kelse, of New Brlghtou,who 'had come to ioos after his brnther,Probably 200 of these people left town onfoot or In vehicles., plunging Into thewoods to the north, across the GrindtÂ­atone river, which skirts The town onthe north. They w-ere literally flceIngbefore the put-suini demon of fire. Overthe bill that rlises beyond the. Grlndstoneis a swamp, and Ce thbs most of thepeople with teams headed, but it prosedno protection. The Ore gave them noopportunity to go further. 8om$ abn""Â­ doned their teams and ran into the lowerparts of the morass, but the tire eoughtthem oat. No one was left to tell thetale, and In. the space of a iltt:e lessthan five acres were counted more thanTWO IIUNDRED AND THIRTY CORPSES.There were mdny families of five, sixand seven, and there they lay the mengenerally a little In advance, the mothersurrounded by her little ones, cut offby the most horrible of deaths.Nearly all the bodies were nude, thefire having burned every vestIge of theirclothing and blackened and charredmany of the corpses beyond recognition,and where who:e famlrles were wiped outas they were, and some of the bodiescompletely incinerated, Identification isabsolutely out of the question. Thosewho fled to the notth on foot followedthe Duluth track, and so rapid was theprogress of the flames that many ofthem were actually burned as they fled,falling on the right of way for a dilÂ­tanes of three miles or more. Nearlythirty bodies were recovered along here.Sorie of the foremost of the escapingcitizens met the Duluth train coming infrom the north. It was due at HInckleyat 4:05. Engineer Jim Root was at thethrotte. He stopped the train and tookon board about 125 of the refugees, whocrowded into the train, completely fillÂ­ing it, for it had a passenger list almostas large.By this time the woods were blazingon each side of the track, and Root reÂ­versed his esgine and started back. Iootran the train back about three miles toSkunk creek, and the people escaped fromthe burning care to the water, and nolives were lost, either of passengers ofor refugees. The people who remainedIn Hinckley rfared the best of all.. TheEastern Minnesota tracks mark the eastÂ­ern edge of the city proper. Just beyondthe road owned a tract of land embracingat least ten acres. It was purchused fora gravel pit to furnish material for thefilling up of holes approaching the cormÂ­pany's bridge across the Grlndstone riverand at othet points. To this fact abouta lounlhoed Hinckleyites owe their lives,for ,the space had been cleared In diggingthe sand.The whole area indicated had beenexcavated to a depth in the center to30 or 40 feet. There wasA POOL OF WATER IN THE CENTER3 feet deep. The pool was wide, and toit fled those citizens who were willingto 'trust to its friendly depths. Therewere 'proably a (tundred of them, andIn addition to the human beings, quite a,number of domestic asnimals, horses, cows,oxen, hogs, ohickens, etc., sought'safetyhere. iIt was really the safest Pt.ce aboutHinckley. Three or four hundred trunks,which were rolled only half way down thesoping banks, passed through the fireunscathed. Thlle people went in here asthe eastern train putlled out a few minÂ­utes after 4 o'clock, end here they reÂ­mained until after 8 o'clock, while thesmoke and flames from the burning cityrolled over their heads. They dashedwater over each other and,covered theirheads with wet cloths to prevent suffesÂ­tion. One unknown man succumbed tothe smoke or the terrible strain, and fellinto the water and wee drowned.So' far us knowran to-day this wasu theonly tragedy of the gravel ""'pit. Othersof the citizens sought refuge In theGrindstone river under the abuttments ofthe two railway brldges and the footbridge. The exact number cannot beknown, as they were scattered along aoopsiderab'e distance. That many escapedand some were drowned is well known.Mrs. Martin biartinson and her fourlittle children were taken, drowned, fromthe water this mnornlng.In the meantIme Hlnckley was burningwith frightfull rapidity, snd in a fewhours nothing was left but blackenedruinls. The loss wll) certainly exceed amillion dollars, vorh but little insurance.TEE SlTUATION AT SANDSTONEIs even more prpalling than that atHinckley, except in point of numbers.Of the 200 people in the town one-fourthare dead.' Otto Stafferfeldt reached herefrom that place to-naght. Be says thepeople were just preparing to leave whenthe fire closed in on three sided, dnd nota single person saved a thing except hisclothing. About 1.10 wont to the riverand 50 or 60 were burned to death.At 4 o'clock this morning over fortybodies, charred and burned, were lyingon every side. The people who were savedare living on potatoes and carrots left Inthe ground.]Ir. Gilroy, conductor on the 'EssternMinnesota Road, says all bridges havebeen burned. One gentleman founa 47dehd bodies at Sanstone lying uncoveredin the sun. The people ore destitute ofeverything.In addition to forty-seven bodies atSandstone, 'there are twenty at KettleRiver junction. All the settlers in thevicinity are probably hurned to death.O'Neill Brothers had twelve camps inthe woods there, and ti these areburned. Miost of the inmates, however,are believed to, have escapod with theirlives. There are twelve homeless faimllÂ­les at Mission creek, and the same storyis trae of sevcral other places in thatvicinity.From the stories of passengeros on thelimited train, which was bhrned' nearHinckley, the entire train crew deserveto be placed on the 'coll of honor forheroism.Engineer James Root, of White Bear,heads the list, and will have a thrilllngstory to tell if he recovers from his inÂ­juries.

C., Oct. 10.-The Octoberreport of the statistician of the Department ofAgriculture shows the average condition (-f co:'non Oct. 1 to have been 82.7, as compaired with85.2 one month ago, 82.0 on Oct. 1, 1898; 77.1 atthe corresponding date in 1897 and 81.9, themean of the October averages for the last tenIyears. No marked change in condition occurred1during September in any of the principal cornstates, but except in Iowa,. where an improveÂ­ment of two points is' reported, there' was a5 slight impairment. Pending the recent customaryreports from individual farmers and the resultof a careful investigation of conditions in theprincipal wheat states, both spring and winter,by a special agent, no estimate of the yield ofwheat per acre will be made.1The preliminary estimate of the yield per acre; of oats is 30.7 bushels, as compared with 27.8bushels last year, 28.1 bushels in 1897, and 25.8I bushels the average for the last ten years.I Average for quality is 89.5, against 84.5 last yearand 87.6 in 1897. The preliminary estimate cfthe yield per acre of barley is 27.0 bushels, ascompared with 21.6 bushels last year, 24.5 bushÂ­els in 1807 and 23.0 bushels the average for thelast ten years. The average for quality is 88.4against 90.6 last year and 87.6 in 1897. Thepreliminary estimate of the yield per acre ofi rye is 14.4 bushels, as compared with 15.6 bushÂ­- els last year, 16.1 bushels in 1897, and a tenÂ­year average of 13.7 bushels. The average forquality is 90.0, 'against 90.2 last year and 32.7in 1897.The average condition of buckwheat on Oct. 1was 70.2, as compared with 75.2 the previousmonth, 76 2 on Oct. 1, 1898; 90.8 at the correÂ­sponding date in 1897, and 84.2 the mean of theOctober averages for last ten years. The averÂ­age condition of potatoes on Oct. 1 was 81.7, ascompared with 86.3 one month ago, 72.5 on Oct.1, 1898; 61.6 at the corresponding date in 1807,and 73.7 the mean of the October averages forSthe last ten years.In the condition of tobacco there has been aaimprovement of three points in Connecticut andOhio, and the marked improvement of four pointsin New York. On the other hand, there has beena decline of -five points in Virginia, Kentuckyand Wisconsin, of six points in North Carolina,two in Tennessee, and three in Pennsylvania.The reports on sugar cane are somewhat lessfavorable than on Sept. 1, there being a declineof five points in Louisiana and from one point tonine points in all the other sugar cane prodncÂ­ing states, except Florida, where the crop hasabout held its own.The condition of rice has improved six pointsin Louisiana, two points in Florida, and thirÂ­teen points in Texas. The crop has about heldits own in North Carolina and there is a deÂ­cline of three points in South Carolina, ceorgiaand Mississippi and thirteen points in Alabama.Crops anlil",informational,yes435,709894,"Washington, Aug. 10.

BER- , (L'Lnstitut, No. 846, 93.)-The growth of the nails in children is more rapid than in adults, and slowest in the aged. It goes on more promptly in summer than in winter, so that the same nail which is re- newed in 132 days in winter, requires only 116 days in summer-a fact depending on the vis vitalis, which seems to be proportional to it. The increase for the nails of the right hand is quicker than for the left; moreover it differs for the different fingers, and in an order cor- responding with the length of the finger, consequently most rapidly for the middle finger, with nearly equal rapidity for the two either side of this, slower for the little finger, and slowest for the thumb. For the middle finger or the right hand the nail grow 12 millimeters in 108 days; for the small finger or the left, 9 millimeters in 152 days: the growth of all the nails of the left hand required 88 days more than for those of the right, and also there were produced in this time 3 milli- meters less than on the right hand.                 The growth of the hair is well known to be much accelerated by fre- quent cutting. It forms more rapidly in the day than at night and in the hot seasons than in the cold.

She had reached a pointopposite the third story when the ropebecame ignited from the burning sill. Therope parted and the woman fell to thepavement, her brains were dashed ont, andher body flattened into a shapeless mass.So great is the confusion and excitement,that the identityof those killed and injuredis wholly unknown.

She was playing an engagementat the Grand Opera house and had a spomtin the hotel. Every physician in Syraouseis on the ground. Most of those killedwere on the fourth and fifth floors. Atthis hour the hotel is still burnÂ­ing. Vague rumors are afloat that thelist of killed will number fifty persons, butthis fact cannot be substantiated and it isbeheved the number will be less than twenÂ­ty-five, the first estimate. The guard linesstretched across the streets are inadequateto keep back the surging crowds of peoplethat are packed in the streets leadinp to thehotel, and police are stationed all arobnathe building. The seones and incidents conÂ­nected with the rescue of inmarts areheartrending in the extreme. The cries ofwomen standin in rupper windowsand of the exoite crowd beIow were deafÂ­ening and added to the constant roar ofmany fire enginef, created a babel of copÂ­fusion and panicky excitement in andsround the hotel.

Belowthem was a perfect sea of flames. NoposÂ­sibility of escape except by the window wasopen to them and that seemedinevitable death. No assistance couldreach them. A woman seemed to beanxious to jump, but her husband wasearnestly entreating her to desist; thecrowd below waited with bated breath.The woman made one last wfort to jump,but was restrained by her husband, and acry from the crowd sainalled the awful endthat must have befallen them as they fellbackward into the room into a mass offlames. At a window on the fourthfloor, almost directly under this a womanwas eurrounded on all sides from the inÂ­terior of the room by fierce flames. Sheseemed irresolute as to whether to Jump tothe pavement or to face the fiery toe thatwas fast encroaching op her liberty and life.She stepped upqn the sill of thewindow and placed her handsabove her head. The people in the streetbelow shuddered and turned their faco toshut out the horrible sight that must meettheir aze should the woman jump to theground She seemed to be withheld eithery ear or feeling that escape would comefrom some other source. She steppeddownfrom the sill into the room, but remainedat Ate window but an instant when thewhole room beeauheenveloped inlames andshe sank back from view.One of the firemen told this story of awoman who was killed by jumping: ""Wheqlwe first case we were hampered by teletph wires on West Fayette street.

Cuban scouts report today thatthe inhabitants of Caimanera havestrewn the streets with straw and oil,with the intention of destroying thecity and fleeing to the hills.Caimanera lies four miles up thebay from Camp McCalla, under theguns of the American ships , and thesituation is desperate. Starving andfamine stricken, convinced of the ultiÂ­mate triumph pf the American armsand without faith in the protection ofthe Spanish soldiery, the people arebelieved to have determined to leavetheir houses in ashes behind them andseek safety in the mountains to thenorth. The scouts declare that thestory is accurate and say that everybuilding in town is being rapidly preÂ­pared for the torch.The situation of the besieged is afearful one. The people are eatinghorses and mules and are scouring thehills foi fruits and herbs. OccasionÂ­ally brief bombardments by the AmerÂ­ican fleet leave the helpless citizensterror-stricken, no preparations fordefence being made.It is also stated that the Spanishgunboat at Caimanera has been loadedwith inflammables and will be burnedwith the city, her commander declarÂ­ing that she will never become anAmerican prize.The scouts also say that the Spanishsoldiers are in almost as complete astate of panic as are the civilians, andthat they could easily be induced tosurrender. Some of the prisoners takÂ­en by the marines also say they beÂ­lieve the Spanish troops are on theverge of surrender, owing to the lackof food.A NIGHT ATTACK EXPECTEDCaptain McCalla, of the cruiser MarÂ­blehead, and Lieutenant Colonel HunÂ­tington, in command of the marines,are not so sure, however, of the reportÂ­ed Spanish rout. They received inforÂ­mation yesterday that a general atÂ­tack by a force of 3,500 Spanish solÂ­diers and guerillas on Camp McCallais contemplated within a night or two.Every preparation was made lastnight for an expected assault.When the Associated Press disÂ­patch boat Dandy arrived in GuantanÂ­amo harbor, at 8 o'clock, te lUsabout the marine camp were brilliantunder the shifting rays of the searchlights of the Marblehead, Dolphin andScorpion, and the marines were lyingin the rifle pits, at the guns, ready andanxious for battle, but the night passÂ­ed without the firing of a shot. Thesame watchful care was exercised toÂ­day, as Captain McCalla is convincedthat an attack is likely to occur atany moment.The Iowa joined the fleet here thismorning, and, later, the admiral cameover on the flagship to inspect the forÂ­tifications and confer with CaptainMcCalla and Lieutenant Colonel HunÂ­tington.The coast in the vicinity of GuanÂ­tanamo is dotted with the bright huedCuban flag. Numerous camps of the,insurgents which have been establishÂ­ed along the beach between Santiagoand this place are used by the admiÂ­ral as means of communication withthe Cubans in the interior. The aidwhich these men have given has provÂ­ed highly valuable to the Americans.Their stories of the destitution andrevolt among the Spanish soldiers inthis vicinity have been corroboratedby interviews with prisoners capturedaround the camp.General Perrejo, who is in commandof the Spanish forces here, is undoubtÂ­edly in a bad way in regard to obtainÂ­ing food for his men. The prisonerswho have been captured appear to andhave been ill-fed. and are apparentlyindifferent to their fate.Another body of five Spaniards wascaptured yesterday by Ensign A. A.Pratt, of the Marblehead. While cruisÂ­ing in a steam launch outside the bayhe picked up a 50-foot sloop containinga Spanish captain by the name ofTores and four sailors. They said theywere on their way to Guantanamo fora supply of oil for the lighthouse atCape Maysi, but papers found on thesloop proved that they had been sentto obtain information relative to theAmerican forces. The crew of thesloop asserted that they had been illÂ­fed and frightfully ill-treated by theSpanish commander of the Cape Maysiforces.There was a brief bombardment ofa blockhouse up the bay by the batÂ­tleship Oregon yesterday and it is beÂ­lieved that during the firing at leasta score of Spaniards were killed.Scouting parties report that theblockhouse was completely destroyed,but that they were unable to discoverany bodies, the remains of the soldierswho had been killed having probablybeen carried off by their comrades.Late this afternoon the flagship NewYork returned to the fleet off Santiagode Cuba.The marines are growing .very restÂ­less, owing to the delay of the arrivalof the reinforcements of troops, but itIs generally believed here today thatthe transports will reach Santiago notlater than Monday.A rumor to the effect that LieutenÂ­ant Hobson and his fellow heroes ofthe collier Merrimac had been on thewalls of Morro castle, under a SpanÂ­ish guard, caused much excitementamong the fleet off Santiago today,but the story Is disredited on CommoÂ­dore Schley's flagship. The officersthere say that Spanish se.ntries weremistaken for the American prisoners.DESTRUCTION WROUGHT .BY OURFLEET.On Board the Associated Press' DisÂ­patch Boat Dauntless, Off Santiago' ,deCuba, Saturday, June 18, noon, viaKingston, Jamaica, Sunday, June 19,noon",informational,no281,345359,"TIIE AGE OP 8ITEEP.Almost every farmer can tell the age of ahorso by his teeth, but wo doubt whether thesame can be said in regard to sheep.

T., April 28.â€”For milestonight the Canadian valley is a drearywaf.te and her people are overcast withgloom. At sunrise this morning a mightywall of water from six to eight feet highand a mile wide, broke upon West GuthÂ­rie without warning, crushing houses,sweeping away property and drowningpeople by the score. Every movablething was swept away before the wavewhich passed on Into the valley with reÂ­sistless force wreaking terrible destrucÂ­tion to life and property wherever itreached. Dozens of human life are. known to have been sacrificed, how manymay not be known for weeks; hundredsof houses were wrecked in the twinklingof an eye; for miles farms were comÂ­pletely ruined, bridges and tracks werewashed out and railway traffic in everydirection is left at a standstill. The mostcomplete chaos has prevailed all day.! The efforts of rescuing parties have in1 many castes proved in vain. Many peoplej floated down stream before they could bereached and their fate Is unknown.Otherswill pass the night in trees In midstreamor perched on house tops. It is impossibleto estimate the dead. The property lossis nlaced at something near a milliondollars.Fully two-thirds of the victims werecolored people. Business has been susÂ­pended ail day in Guthrie, thestoresandbanks are being closed. As thorough orÂ­ganization for relief as Is possible hasI been made, but ail aid has been hecesÂ­sarlly retarded by the confused condiÂ­tion of things. It will be Impossible toexplore the houses until the water shallsubside as many of them are submerged.As darkness gathered over the scenemany overturned houses could be seen| far out lnthe flood but it could not belearned whether their occupants esÂ­caped. The river is thirty feet above itsordinary level.A heavy rain began falling this afterÂ­noon. A threatening bank of cloudscame up from the northwest and manyÂ­persons fled to their tornado cellars, fearÂ­ing that another wind disaster was uponthem. Luckily, however, the damagewas slight.A CLOUDBURST.The flood Is supposed to have beencaused by a cloudburst, supplementedby heavy rainÂ«>.The Cottonwood river, ordinarily asmall stream, that winds between steepbanks In West Guthrie, was bank fullfrom a heavy rain yesterday, and lastnight, but no alarm had been felt as theriver had been rising gradually duringthe night. About 6 oclock, however, waÂ­ters from a cloudburst above had addedto those already nearly up to the levelof the high banks, and the flood wassweeping through West Guthrie, a secÂ­tion populated mostly by colored people.Persons who saw the first wall of watersaid that it was about eighteen inchesj high, spreading entirely across the val-I ley. There was no water in front of Itsave that in the river's channel. The.irst wave was followed by others inquick succession until the whole swelledto a bank of water from six to eight feethigh. Many had carryÂ­ing their household goods to places ofsafety, but few had made more than onetrip when they were forced to flee fortheir lives before a raging, resistless torÂ­rent that no power of man could hove tostop.The main supply pipe of water workssystem burst where It crossed the CotÂ­tonwood, in the southern prt of the cityand all the water in the reservoirs pourÂ­ed into the river.In the southwestern part of the city along arm of land is formed by the windÂ­ing the river. On this land lived hunÂ­dreds of negroes. During the night thebridge leading across the river to themain section had been swept away. Thepeople w ere absorbed In watching therising waters when the flood from th-?reservoirs came down in a solid wall andcut across the arm of land near themainland, cutting off the people fromescape. They fled from their homes tothe higher portions of the newly formedisland.QUICKLY OVERIn half an hour the mountain of waterhad done Its work and practically spentitself. The air became hideous with thocrashing of houses and the cries for helpof the unfortunates. When the firstshock of the disaster was over the morefortunate on the island Immediately beÂ­gan to help those nearest them, whileacross in Guthrie proper prompt stepswere taken at rescue.The houses, barns and other effectsbegan to drift down stream,each freight -ed with one or more human beings;boats or rafts shot out here and therefrom the shore and desperate effortsLOS ANGELES, THURSDAY MORNING, APRIL 29, 1897were made to rescue the people. ImÂ­provised rafts were quickly thrown toÂ­gether and started out Into the madstream. Before many of them had beer,propelled a couple of yards from short:they were twisted and broken by the waÂ­ters and the would-be rescuers throwninto the stream. Half a dozen rescuerswere drowned even before those theytried to save had been reached.Gus Piatt, business manager of theGuthrie Leader, and George Willis, amerchant tailor, swam the river at therisk of their lives and secured a boat,by which a number of persons weresaved.A negro woman with a babe in herarms, desperately tried to steady herÂ­self in a tree-top, calling the while forhelp. She grew weaker and the babyslipped Into the water and was drowned.She was finally rescued and said herfamily of six had succumbed.A woman wading from home with herbabe on her head, was seen to go underand a man swimming the channel toreach four women and a baby in a treewas carried down stream.Two women and a child were carriedaway on a bridge further down streamnnd one man and two women, In plainsight of shore, were on a house roofwhen it went to pieces. They all perÂ­ished.An old negro woman was seen ridinga house-top. The building soon turnedover and she was drowned. Three men.Walter Olds, Van Dusen and EugeneGill, sought to rescue an old man froma tree. Their raft struck an overhangÂ­ing tree and they barely saved themÂ­selves by clambering Into another tree.They were finally rescued on a rope Eentto them by means of a shotgun and cord.TO THE BESCUETwo men secured a small stern wheelpleasure boat and started to the rescueof half a dozen men and women lodgedin a tree. The persons were rescuedamid the cheers of the spectators. Thecable holding the craft finally broke andIt was carried down stream, but ultiÂ­mately landed safely.Adjutant-General Jameson of the terÂ­ritorial militia, narrowly escaped withhis family. He was forced to wade andlead his horse with his family in thebuggy.John Metz, aged 55, was capsized whiletrying to save a woman who sank beforehe reached her. Metz himself was bareÂ­ly rescued.George Owens, Attorney Teague Rayand Dick Pearson were precipitated Intothe water while trying to save some peoÂ­ple and Owers was drowned. The wifeand five children of Wesley McGill, colÂ­ored, were drowned In their home.Gus Piatt and GeoÃŸge Willis swamthrough the main channel, cut a boatfrom Its moorings, saving seven peopleand making a landing miles below thecity.1 Tonight forty or fifty people could beseen clinging to trees and roofs of buildÂ­ings but could not be reached and willhave to spend the night where they are.The strength of many may fall thembefore morning. If It does nothing buta watery grave awaits them.The fate of many oth-ers who areknown to have been cf:ried downstream will not be knoÂ»vn until dayÂ­break, and perhaps not then. It Is ImÂ­possible to get any definite news fromthe hundreds of rescued people on thebluffs west of the city, and those whoescaped are rushing franically aboutin search of missing ones. The river isgoing down rapidly tonight.WILD RUMORSIt is Impossible even approximatelyto estimate the loss of life. When darkÂ­ness settled over the city tonight thewildest stories were afloat. Many wereclaiming that all of fifty lives had beerlost, and not Infrequently men wereheard claiming that fully 200 had perÂ­ished. Those wilder estimates are unÂ­questionably exaggerated, but the exÂ­aggeration Is not to be wondered at ifthe frightful incidents of the disasterare but considered. Lives were lost inthe flood in every direction in plain viewof the few who w ere heroically carryingon the work of rescue and the many whostood helpless on the edge of the ragingwaters. Men, women and childrenstruggled in the torrent side by side withhorses, cattle and swine, one perishinghere, another there, and in other placesseveral disappearing together beneaththe flood.At dark tonight but two bodies havebeen recovered.TH*E DEATH LISTThe bodies recovered are those of thefollowing:Anna Kaiser, a school teacher.Frank Mayers.Others known to have been drownedare: Â»George Owens.J.

Many farm houses inthat district are reported to have beenswept away.Seven miles south of here, at Seward,Hunt's store and postofiice were sweptaway.Four thousand dollars was raised inGuthrie this afternoon for the relief ofthe sufferers.AT EL RENOCyclone and Flood Sweep the DoomedRegionEL RENO, O. T., April 28.â€”For thefirst time since the white man settledill the Canadian valley, twenty-nineyears ago, this morning's sun sent itsrays over an Oklahoma sea. For tenyears the dust-parched people hadlooked aloft with discouragement andprayed for rain to save their crops orquench their thirst, as the case might be.The flood of water that poured from theskies and wiped their homes and farmsout of existence and In many Instancesswept away human lives, proved ananswer to their supplications thatamounted to punishment. The finalstorm and flood came as a fitting climaxto a week of unusually heavy rains anddamaging floods. The dry spell wasbroken Saturday, when a fierce storm,that turned the streets Into torrents,v. ashed away crossings, tore out sewers,moved small buildings find broke up thetown. It washed the earth clean. SatÂ­urday at midnight the people werefrightened nearly to distraction when ahurricane, blowing forty-six miles anhour, drove blinding sheets of waterthrough the roofs of their poorly builtor badly damaged houses. They weredriven In terror to their storm cellarsand caves and spent the night in momenÂ­atry expectation of being borne awayby storm or flood.Sunday morning shone bright andclear, and the gauge phowed a fall of5.1 inches since Saturday noon. Thestreets had been plowed with gulches,small buildings toppled over, and hereand there furniture and other houseÂ­hold effects floated about the streets.The valley of the Canadian, which SatÂ­urday morning had been a beautiful.""tretch of forms and homes, on SunÂ­day displayed a long network of conÂ­nected lakes and islands, dotted withhalf-flooded houses and horses and catÂ­tle struggling for places of safety.Yesterday at noon a heavy cloud sweptup from the west and another delugeppread over the town. The water fellIn perfect sheets and by 6 o'clock In theevening the gauge read 6.86 Inches. Acalm about 7 o'clock brought attentionto an Intensely black and monstrouscioud moving toward the city from thev est. It was a typical tornado, indicatedby the peculiar whistle of the windwhich almost universally accompaniesa ""twister.""The cry, ""Get under ground,"" arose onall sides, and the streets were soon filledwith running, shouting people, seekingcave or cellar. Stores and homes weredeserted and the people huddled togetherawaiting the blow. Fortunately the cenÂ­ter of the storm passed over only thesoutheastern corner of the town, strikÂ­ing the eastern hills across the valley,wrecking all it touched.After the tornado came the heaviestfall of water ever recorded here In a iik?period, over two Inches falling in thirtyminutes. All day the river had been risÂ­ing at a fearful rate, reaching the sleepÂ­ers of the railroad bridge and moving itout of line. The wagon bridge went outwhen the water reached its floor and thebridge and drift, serving as an obstrucÂ­tion, forced the water out over the botÂ­toms, washing out crops, moving housesand drowning stock.A dam on the Ellison ranch gave wayto the torrent and carried out a bridgeon the Fort Reno road,swept the grounosclean and flooded the yards of the ChocÂ­taw railroad. Rising to the houses ofthe bottoms, farmers were obliged to deÂ­sert their places and endeavor to savatheir lives. The rescue of many familieswas made at great danger to the resell- |ers' lives. A party composed of A. E.Woodlleff, Pete Carr, Henry Schaeffer,Charles Justin, James Tomklns, Rev.: Father Hall and others immediately setto work to rescue the unfortunates. Atthe home of Thomas Palmer, the iatter'swife and several children were rescuedfrom the tops of bureaus just as the waÂ­ter was creeping up to their feet. Theyhad been screaming for help for sometime, and It was with great difficultythat they were removed to the improvisÂ­ed rafts of the rescuers and taken to dryland. The families of Mrs. Hall, TomPotter, Col. Severy and Mrs. Black wererescued from their homes in a similarmanner. In each instance the water hadswept through the windows and wasgradually rising. During the trip a raftof railroad ties went to pieces on a subÂ­merged wire fence and the entire partywas thrown into the water, but theywere all saved. A little child of FrankHolman fell into a washed out crossingand was drowned. Mr. Bickford, amilkman, nearly lost his life in trying tosave the little one. The Ice plant wasflooded to a depth of four feet and HarryBradford was awakened about 1 oclockthis morning to find himself in a floatÂ­ing bed. The bed tuned when he triedto rise, covered him with wet blankets,sank and nearly drowned him.Lightning played havoc, striking thespire of the Presbyterian church and toÂ­tally wrecking it. Mrs. McGrath, wifeof the cashier of the Stock bank, seated In her home across thestreet, w as knocked from her chair andbadly hurt. The schoolhouse for colÂ­ored children was struck at 3 oclock inthe afternoon, the structure shatteredand about fifty pupils more or less seriÂ­ously hurt. Among the more badly inÂ­jured are Eva Clauston, Bertha Turner,Charles Waters and Beulah Clauston.The latter was paralyzed.Several other houses were struck bylightning, but no one else was hurt.Further west the lightning killed mucnstock. The electric light wires wentdown and the town was in darkness lastnight. Reports from surrounding townsare meager, as telegraph wires are downand trains have all been stopped on acÂ­count of washouts, it Is known, howÂ­ever, that many homes have been washÂ­ed out In towns adjacent to El Reno,and it is feared many lives have beenlost. West of here Frank Thompson andthe 16-year old son of Hiram McGriffenwere drowned.MISSISSIPPI FLOODSlowa Cities Badly Damaged, But NoLives LostKEOKUK, lowa, April 28.â€”The creÂ­vasse in the Hunt levee which broke yesÂ­terday Is now 300 feet wide and all terriÂ­tory back of it is flooded. Every govÂ­ernment boat in this vicinity has beenpressed into service to stop the crevasse,but Major Meigs said that It would taketwo weeks' hard work to do it. The damÂ­age is already done and hundreds offarmers are ruined and have saved nothÂ­ing but the clothes they wore. The breakcame so unexpectely that It was a rushfor life without any opportunity to saveanything. The situation in the subÂ­merged district is deplorable. Thirtythousand acres of fine land are subÂ­merged and prospects for crops this seaÂ­son are gone.

London, June 3. â€” The match between the Australians and Oxford Univerity was concluded to-day, the result being a victory for the Australians. The weather was wet, and the attendance was consequently not large. The wicket, however, was still lively, and was not much affected by the rain. The Oxford team continued their second innings, Fry and Bathurst, the nbt-out men of the previous day, again taking their place at the wickets. After adding 5 to his score, Fry was caught by. Graham, off Giff en's bowling. Bathurst pat 9 together, and was then smartly stumped by Jarvis. Arkwright and Brain made a good stand, the former playing a good innings for 30, while Brain carried out his bat for 16. Wilson also played well for 10. The innings closed for .155, the Australians thus winning a closely contested match by 19 runs. Lateb. â€” Fry was finely caught at shortleg by Graham with one hand, the score standing at 81. The batting then fell off, and the eighth wicket fell for 97. Arkwright hit Giffen for 12 in one over. He was caught in the slips by that bowler. Brain and Wilson made a determined stand, and the finish caused much excitement. Wilson was at length finely caught by Bruce at square-leg on the boundary.

Immediately after commencing the reÂ­turn journey the train was fired on from four posiÂ­tions on which the Boers bad artillery posted. Thetwo trucks in front of the engine left the rails andtoppled over, while the train was thus renderedhelpless. The Dublins and volunteers faced theenemy in skirmishing order. The Boers pouredshot and shell fire into the crippled train. The deÂ­railed waggons were with great difficulty removed,and the line cleared, and the engine and tender thensteamed backwards. The only newspaper corresÂ­, pondent present was Mr. Winston Churchill, whodistinguished himself by his courageous conduct,as did also Wagner, the driver, and Stuart thestoker of the engine. It is feared that the Dublinsand Durban Light Infantry fared badly. A RedCross party have gone out.A telegram despatched at 5-30 p.m. says-Seven. men of the Durban Light Infantry have just comeI in, leaving twenty-three still missing.

Tho first day of thefifty-first year of the reign of Queen VicÂ­toria over Great Britain opened with perÂ­fect summer weather in London. Alovelier day could not have been, desiredfor the celebration of Her Majesty'j-ibi-lec.The sun shone bright, the air wasclear and not very warm, and a gentlebrecz: blew steadily. The crowds scatÂ­tered over the city unprecedented innumbers and size. Thousands ofpeop'c who yesterday selected locaÂ­tions aloag the route of to-day'aprocession, in order to retain them occuÂ­pied them all night, and many used camptools or improvised rests to enable themto withstand the long and tiresome occuÂ­pation. A steady stream of carriagesand pedestrians poured constantly allnieht until dawn throuch ths city fromall directions towards West End. At fiveo'clock this morning every point of vantÂ­age along the streets ctfmposinjthe royalprocession route was secured. At nineo'clock the line of route was on each sidea compact mass of people. Everybody,despite the discomfort of the crowding,manifested the utmost good humor.The scene at TVestmlnister Abbey wasmost brilliant. Every seat was filledand every person present was a distinÂ­guished person. When the identitieswere enumerated it seemed as if everylocality the world over had sent one ormore of its representative personages to-do honor to England's Queen on Britain'sgreatest holiday. There never, probably,m modern times, assembled under oneroof an audience so weH and so brilliantÂ­ly arrayed. Every man present entitledto wear a uniform or decoration had bothon, new or burnished up. Whenhis audience was all seatedthe scene presented was incomparable.When the sun shene brightly through thenoble stained windows of the Abbey itsrays fell upon an unaccustomed sight aaathe picture was indescribable. This auÂ­dience, banked up as it was in church,was anything but somber. For awhileThe I'rn-e cf VTalcs.when all were seated there was quiet, butthis wa only temporary and lasted onlylong enoush to enable the people to locateone anothir.. Then there was the life ofrecognition and of gossip, and it graduÂ­ated rapidly into a noisy hum.This was startling to a person whoentered suddenly, considering the placeand who were buried there, but thestranger was soon fascinated and himselfadded to what had struck him as desecraÂ­tion. Busy and interested as were thepecple making the irreverent congregaÂ­tion, some personages entered the Abbeystrong enough to compel general attenÂ­tion and recognition. When the Marquisof Salisbury, the Queen's Prime Minister,entered and proceeded to the place setapart for him, he was cheered. WhenMr. Gladstone was observed quietlyedging his way to his seat he was alsocheered.Such was the eagerness of these whohad assured places in the audience atWestminster to he on hand that scores oflords and ladies repaired to the edifice atTinnecessanly early hours and, as manyof them admitted, without having parÂ­taken of any breakfast. It was a strangesight to see flisks and sandwiches exÂ­changed in such a crowd and eagerly usedtoy numberless aristocrats, unable longerto withstand hunger and thirst. Thisbusiness, when added to the hum, attimes seemed irreverent, even on JubileeDay, in Westminster.The lino of the procession from BuckÂ­ingham Palace to Westminster Abbey'was as follows: From the palace portalsalong Constitution Hill, P.cculilly, ReÂ­jrent street, Waterloo place. Pall"" Mall,East Cockspur street, Xorrhumberlandavenue, Thames embankment. Bridgestreet to the Abbey. The line of routewas kept by nearly tea thousand troops,representing all branches of the service,mod in addition six hundred boys fromnaval training ships were drawn up atthe base of Kelson monument. In addiÂ­tion to the military, many thousands ofpolice, both mounted and on foot, were ontfuty under the command of Sir CharlesWarren. The military force was underthe command of General GIpps andColonel Stirling of the ColdstreamGuards.The particular feature at BuckinghamPalace was that the two services were-equally honored, the guards lining oneaide ol the roadway at Buckingham PalÂ­ace gates, and on the other side the BlueJackets were posted. The same serviceswere also represented in a like manner atthe entrance to Westminster Abbey.The first of the royal procession wascomposed of the Indian princes and afewminor German prince.Punctually at 11:15 a. m. the Queen, inma open carriage, emerged from thepalace gates. At sight of her thousandsof voices were lifted up in cheers, the apÂ­plause being accompanied by the music ofanany military bands stationed in front ofthe palace. The Qoeea did not wear herstate robes, but was dressed in black.Her carriage was drawn by eight ponies.The Prince of Wales, the Duke of EdinÂ­burg, the Prince of Connancrht. her mmw i-rawa rnnce imperial of Germany,the""""iui oi ixirne: rrincewiisuaa 0f Bchleswig-Holsteinman rnnce Henry of Battenberg, hronsnnaw, and Princes Albert-Victorand George of Wales, Prince Albert otEdinburgh and Prin William nt v,..&amp;Fftmm ftU rpae ia Xuil ub-7 - Pi)t2 j&amp;7V'r Saassssgfrrtt Jab?.- iiSEsfSwPy'form beside the Queen's coach as a bod)guard.When the people at the palace gates hadshouted themselves hoarse cheering foithe Queen, they continued to cry out""Long lifo to the Prince and Princess oiWales.""The Queen, as she left the palace,seemed to be la excellent spirits andsmiled and bowed graciously to the peepie on every side. The Queen's carriagewas a large one of chocolate color, wheelrea. ana the royal arms in gold cmblazoned upon the panels. Red morocco harÂ­ness was used for the horses, which wereotherwise decorated with royal blue ribbons. All the servants were in state lireries of scarlet and gold. The other carriages containing m ambers of the royalfamily were of a gorgeous character,horsed with four bavs each, and all open.The prccoasioa proceeded at a smartwalking pace to Constitution Hill, andthen adopted a more deliberate gait-Owing to the late spring, the boautiÂ­ful green of the avenue trees the sweetodor ot the hawthorncs and the splendiduniforms of the military, coupled withthe enthusiasm of the crowd mada themdmF&amp;ZjrmMr&amp;iftT!it rrinte$i of Welti.eccaslon one of refreshing enchantment.The precession slowly made its way until the Wellington arch was reached, andthen the first introduction to the Londonstreets ensued. Emerging from the WellÂ­ington arch, the first to greet the Queenwere the convalescent patients and ethersat the St. George Hospital, which waspacked from basement to roof, seats having been erected for thousands over theroof of the hospital.On reaching Piccadilly the Queen wasseen to look up at Apsley House, and atshe passed the mansions of her iramdlalo lriends she glaced somewhat hastilyat their abodes, more especially whenpassing the Duke of Cambridge's, BaronRothschilds', Baroness Burdett-Couts' andJohn Bright' s old apartments.It was not until Devonshire House wasreached that the Queen began to realizethe grand preparations made to greether. Here the Marquis of Hartingtonhad a spacious gallery erected fromwhich many hundreds of gaily dressedladies waved their handkerchiefs andcheered the Queen.Facing Devoas hire House another glgantic booth had been erected and fromthis point to Westminister every point ofvantage had been seized bv contractorsto fix seats. Shop fronts and first floorsrented at from 20 to 50, and in somecases even more.The front of the Burlington Arcade, theRoyal Academy, thi Ejyptiaa Hall, St.James Farishchurch, (where ten thousandhildren were seated, and sang ''GodSave the Queen."") and the Musuem ofGeology, were all packed with human beings.On reaching Regent Circle, whsre sixmain streets converge, the sight was amemorable one, the streets being allsplendidly decorated with Sowers, flags.evergreens, etc. The imposing buildingof hwan 65 Edgar's great drapery store;the County Fire office; the Cafe Monico;the London Pavilion and the world-famedCriterion restaurant were one sea ofheads. Many of the shops hereaboutshad their fronts removed and elegantboudoirs framed in their placej.The procession, as viewed from theDuke of York's column, passing downthe hill f rem the circle to Pall Mall, east,was a remarkable sigat. Tha shouts ofthe crowd were hcaid from the top of thacolumn as one vast roar.Many American ladies and gentlemenbad secured scats in the palatial estabÂ­lishment of Howell and Samis, in WaterÂ­loo place, and joined in the enthusiasmas keenly as the Britishers.Passing around Pall Mall, east, a largegallery was erected over the colonnade ofher Majesty's theater, while fivo hundredchairs at from three to five guineas eachwere all filled, nt the Waterloo Housein Cockspur streetTrafalgar Square, was now reached,and everywhere ene looked nothing butheads were to be viewed.

Covert, United States Consulat Lyons, France, reports to the StateDepartment a novel use to which glassis being put in that city. Early in OctoÂ­ber last a paving company there beganlaying a piece of pavement of ceramoÂ­crystal, or devitrified glass. During themonths of November, December and JanÂ­uary the pavement was driven over durÂ­ing all hours of the day and night. Itstood the hard usage as well as anypavement could, and at the time of thetransmission of the report was in an adÂ­mirable state of preservation. The glasspavement Is laid in the form of blockseight inches square, each block containÂ­ing sixteen parts in the form of checkers.These blocks are so closely fitted toÂ­gether that water cannot pass betweenthem, and the whole pavement looks likeone large checker board. Like all thorÂ­oughfares of France, the roadbed slopesgently to the walk on each side. Someof the edges of the checkers have beenbroken off during their three months'service, Mr. Covert counted about twenÂ­ty that were slightly chipped on theedges. It is contended that this does notargue against the value of the materialas a pavement, and that any kind ofstone would have suffered just as muchor more in the same time. The advanÂ­tages claimed for this kind of pavementare that it offers a greater resistancethan stone; that it is a poor conductorof cold, and ice will not form upon itreadily; that dirt will not accumulateupon it as easily as upon stone, and thatit will not retain microbes; also that it ismore durable than stone, and just ascheap. The new product is obtained frombroken glass, heated to a temperature of1,250 degrees, and compressed in maÂ­trices by hydraulic force. The firm manuÂ­facturing this material proposes to havea large house constructed entirely ofglass as one of the features of the comÂ­ing Paris Exposition. Glass is to be usedfor tubes, pipes, vats, tiles, smokestacksand for all other purposes. It is claimedthat it can be built more cheaply than ifbrick were used",informational,yes347,51539809930,"Killed and OneHundred and TwentyWounded.Men, Women and Children Scaldedor Blown into the Riverand Drowned,:Heat--relndi-ng Scene--Â·-r,'at ExÂ­c'it'.miuntamong the People.Sitatements of the Engineer andOne of the Firemen,Fri ,,htful J) a (tr.NE:w Yoser, July 30.-The Staten Island Grferry-boat Westficld, crowded with passengers,exploded her boiler at 1:20 to-day in the slip indcat Whitehall street.

There was nofog at the time, while the wind on herport quarter was not sufficient to preÂ­oent her answering the helm. It hasbeen suggested that her compass wasfaulty. but daylight lasted long afterEddystone light was passed. The sailÂ­ors say the fact that the Lizard lightwas not visible should have served togive the alarm.The masts of the ""Mohegan,"" whichare above water, show that her sterni: landward, causing a. theory that thenavigating officer, on discovering thathe was in the bay, suddenly turned seaÂ­'ard.

A room in which meat, in an advanced de. gree of decomposition, had been kept for some time, was instantly deprived of all smell on an open coffee roaster being carried through it, containing a pound of coffle newly roasted. In another room, exposed                 to th effluvium occasioned by the clearing out of a dung-pit, so that sulphuretted hy. drogen and ammonia in great quantity could be chemically detected, the stench was coni                 pletely removed within half a minute on the employment of three ounces of fresh-roasted coffee; whilst the other parts of the house were permanently cleared of the same smell by being simply traversed with the coffee roaster, although the cleansing of the dung. pit lasted for several hours longer. Even the smell of musk and castoreum, which cannot be overpowered by any other sub. stance, is completely dispelled by the fumes of coffee; and the same applies to the odour of assafretida. It was remarked, however, ihat in general animal effluvia are more res- dily affected by it than vegetable.                 That here an actual neutralization, and not a mere envelopment of matter, takes place, is shown from this,-that the first fumes of the coffee are imperceptible, and continue so until a point of saturation, so to speak, is reached, whereupon the obnoxious smell disappears, and thatof coffee predomi. nates. TIho reverse happens with other aro matic vapours, and even with acetic acid and                 chlorine.

LONDON, SEPT. 16. It has boon ascertained 'hat before he left tho United Stales Tynan unfolded to his associates a plot which ho had dovised against the life of the Prinoo of Wales. His project .was to rent a house opposite to Marlboroughhouse, tho town rosideneo of His Royal Highness, excavuto a tunnel between thetwo, and explode a quantity of dynamite under Marlborough-house. Tynan was supported by a group of Nihilists at Chicugo, hended by Rubinovitz, a chemist, and they provided the funds for the undertaking. . .

At one time It falseemed as if it would be lost, for guns had been dismounted chby the Austrian fire, and in the wooded groundthe needleÂ­ P,gun had no fair field, and the infantry fight was very equal. S,Then Prince Frederick Charles sent the Fifth and Sixth diÂ­ ofvisions forward. Theylaid down their helmets and knapÂ­ dosacks on the ground, and rdvanced to the river.

Then the cavalry got out of hand, and p1by small detachments rushed on the Austrian battalions, but Ctthese, though retreating fast, was not routed, and in many inÂ­stances beat off the cavalry, who also suffered much from the wAustrian artillery, for the shells burst repeatedly among the resquadrons, and killed many men and .horees.

The immediate cause of thp victory was the CrownPrince's attack on the Austrian left flank, which turned theposition, but the attack in front had a great effect on theissue, as unless it had been steadily maintained, the Austriansmight have repulsed the attack in flank.It is the opinion of the Prussian generals that the Austrianretreat was most skilful, and that their artillery was .ecelÂ­lently handled.Theonumber of troops engaged on the Prussian side wasabout two hundred and fifty thousand. The Austrians aresupposed to have had almost an equal number. No detailshave yet been received of the number of killed, wounded, orprisoners.The London Times says that ""the incidents of this battlemake it clear that the greatest battle of the present age waswon by the superior prowess of the victors, and was not theconsequence of a merely mechanical advantage. The needle.gun added, no doubt, to the completeness of the victory, hutif the Prussians had possessed no such weapon, the spirit oftheir onset, and the skilful arrangements by which a part oftheir army was brought on to the flank and rear of the enemy,would have effectually dislodged the Austrians from their po.sltion.""THE PURISUIT CONTINUED ON TILE 9TH.A despatch dated at the Prussan headquarters at Pardubitz,July 9, says:""The army of the Crown Prince, which forms the Wted'arwee of the pursuing force, is",informational,no413,682330,"rue de Lille.COMPAGN IE DE B IO-TINTO SOUSCRIPTION PUBLIQUE Ã  60,000 obligations hypothÃ©caires de 500 francs (2 e sÃ©rie ) Remboursables au pair en 33 ans Rapportant un intÃ©rÃªt annuel de 25 fr. nets de tout impÃ´t PAYABLE PAR TRIMESTRE Les 1 er janvier, 1 er avril, 1 er juillet, 1 er octobre Prix d'Ã‰mission : 475 francs JOUISSANCE DO 1"" AVRIL 1884 Fr. 50 Â» En souscrivait Fr. 50 Â» tS Â» A la rÃ©partition (du 31 mai au 5 >Â«2 1884) ""Ã5 Â» *85 Â» Du 1Â« au 5 juillet (moins le coupon de 6 fr. 25 Ã©chu le 1"" juillet) 118 &lt;35 185 Â» Du .1"" au 5 aoÃ»t 4884 125 Â» ÃŽOO Â» Du 1 er au 5 seotembre 1884..

Exactfigures are impossible to obtain norcan the full list of names of the victimsbe had. When the whole story is told,however, and the facts known, theabove calculation will be found not farfrom correct.The trains that came dn Iollisionwere special excursion trains filled withpilgrinth en route from Sherbrooke.Richmond and Windsor Mills to Levis,where they were to cross over to QueÂ­bec and proceed to the shrine at St.Anne de Beaupre. and were followingone another with an interval of 20 minÂ­utes between them.The forward train was making goodtime, having left Richmond at 10 o'clocklast night. On the rear of this trainwas a Pullman, in which were thepriests and others in. charge of theparty, and it was in this car that mostof the loss of life occurred. The firsttrain reached this station, which is 14miles west of Levis, about 3 o'clock,and stopped at the tank to take water.Due precautions were taken and thesemaphore thrown to danger againstthe following train. Only the -train menwere out and about, attending to theirduties. The Pullman in the rear waswrapped in silence, and the sleeperswere unaware of the terrible fate thatwas rushing upon them.Suddenly there was a crash-the secÂ­ond train, coming at full speed, hadcrashed into the rear Pullman of thefirst section. So great was the impetusof the colliding train that the engineembedded itself In the palace car andthe latter plunged forward and partlytelescoped the first class car ImmediÂ­ately In front.Every berth in the Pullman: waswrecked, eopd 'some of the occupantswho weCre killed-never iSPew what hapÂ­pened to th.m. They died sleeping.Others -awoke 'to' their horrible turÂ­roundings and"" position, maimed, bleedÂ­Ing'and bruised, conscious of little elsebut the agony that racked them.it was an awful scene. The cries ofthe wounded and the moans of the dyÂ­ing and the outpouring of passengersfrom the cars that were not badly damÂ­aged and the hurrying forms of the unÂ­injured train men with their flickeringlanterns, all combined to make a disÂ­tressing sight.The work of recue was begun as soonas possible. When the blinding cloudsof steam had subsided the trainmen.priests and others got together, andthe dead and wounded were taken fromthe ruins of the engine, the Pullman,and the first-class car and removed totemporay quarters, where the women ofthe party administered as best theycould to the wants of the maimed pilÂ­grims.They tore off their underclothing andmade bandages for gaping wounds, andtried, in the absence of enough medicalaid, to go around to staunch the flowof blood and properly cleanse thewounds. Word was at once sent toMontreal, and an order from there wassent to Levis to send out a force of docÂ­tors from Quebec to attend to thewounded and a force of men to clearthe track.The special train from there reachedhere at an early hour, and all of thewounded that could be moved wereplaced on board and sent east to Levis,where they coum be cared for in hospl-.tale.It is hard to say where the blame forthe accident rests. It has been suggestÂ­ed' that Engineer McLeod might havefallen asleep, and thus have missedseeing the warning semaphore, and wasunconscious of his whereabouts. InÂ­deed. this would seem to be the onlytheory that can be advanced, but astrict investigation will be held at onceto determine where the responsibilityrests.Levis. Que..

The DallyNews correspondent, telegraphingfrom Bulgareui, fifteen miles east ofPlevna, gives a detailed accouut of- e fighting on Monday. The Turkish force was estimated at fifty thou-jsand. They occupied a series of po- muz2le of her piljtol to hia Lead andsitions, which are naturally strong, a third time, killing him instantly.

Skabelaff held in check a strongTurkish force at Looca, whichwasthe extremity of the Turkish line. .Gen. Krudeuer began the battleabout half past nine o'clock. Aftera long bombardment he succeededin silencing the Turkish cannon atGrivica, but could never expel theinfantry from the earthworks. Hespent the whole afternoon unavailingly endeavoring to force the north-, ,em flank of the Turkish positiondesisting after dark without havinggained any thing material and havinz himself suffered considerable loss.Prince Schakasky about noon carried Radizvo, and planting four batteries on the ridge beyond bombarded the nearest Turkish positionwhich was an earthwork armed withcannon, in the front of an entrenched village. After an hour's cannonade he silenced the Turkish gunsand his infantry, after a long andbloody contest, carried the earthworks aud village.The second Turkish position, consiating of a redoubt and a aeries otrongly entrenched vineyards, was..x-n attacked and ultimately carriedbut with a terrible effort and greatloss, owing to the heavy Turkish arlillery fire. The Russians moreoverwere unable to utilize the capturedposition. About 4 o'clock a reservebrigade was brought up and an attack made on the positions immediately covering Plevna. The attackwas continued till nearly sunsetThe Turkish infantry was in greatforce. iu continuous line under shelter of trenches, and despite the moststubborn efforts no impression couldbe made on that line. Two companies of Russian infantry did workround to the right of the Turkishtrenches and. entered the town ofPlevna, but it was inippossible tohold it. The Russian batteries pushed boldly forward into the positionfirst taken to attempt to keep downthe Turkish cannonade which wascrashing into the infantry in theopen field, but they were compelledto evacuate the hazardous spot, Atsundown the Turks made a continuous forward movement and re-occupied their recent position. The Ilussian infantry made a succession ofdespeiate stands and died like heÂ­roes. The Turks gradually re-tookeverything they bad lost. , The fightÂ­ing lasted long after night. TheBashi Bazouks took possession ofthe ba -tie field and slew all the wounded. The Russians held the heightsabove Radizvo. but the Bashi Bazouks worked around the'r rear andfell on the wounded collected in thevillage of Radizvo. A retreat wascompelled in the direction of BalgaÂ­reni.

They are in perfection when fromfive to seven years old. The, age of an oyster isnot to be found out by looking into its mouth; itbears its years upon its back. Everybody who hashandled an oyster-shell must have observed that mtseemed as if composed of successive layers orplates overlapping each other. These are techni-cally termed  shoots, and each of them marks ayears growth, so that, by counting theam, we candetermine at a glance the year when the creaturecame into the world. Up to the epoch of itsmaturity the shoots are regular and successive, butafter that time they become irregular, and arepiled one over the other, so that the shell becomesmore and more thickened and bulky. Judgingfrom the great thickness to which some oyster-shells have attained, this mollusk is capable, ifleft to its natural changes and unmolested, ofattaining a patriarchal longevity. Ainnon~, fossiloysters specimens are found occasionally of enor-mous thickness; and the amnount of time that haspassed between the deposition of the bed of rock inwhich such an example occurs, and that whichoverlies it, might be calculated from careful obser-vation of the shape and number of layers of calcare-ous matter composing an extinct oyster-shell. Insome ancient formations stratum above stratum ofextin~uishod oysters may be seen, each bed con-sisting of full-grown and aged individuals.

Beginning shortly afternoon, the fire raged until evening, conÂ­suming everything in its way. It had itsorigin, it is thought, in the Merchants'cafe, adjoining the Bank of Victor, at Thirdstreet and Victor avenue. A strong windfrom the south fanned the flames, and ina few minutes all the surrounding houseswere afire.Help was summoned from Cripple Creek,but the town had been built in the earlydays of the camp and was of pine timber,for the most part, and burned like paper.Efforts were made to stop the progress ofthe flames by blowing up buildings intheir path by means of dynamite, and allafternoon the hills roared with the exÂ­plosions, but the effort was in vain.The fire claimed the Bank of Victor, thepostoffice on the corner opposite, crossedThird street and fillowed the row ofblocks between Third and Fourth streetsto the north taking the Victor Bankingcompany, the Western Union telegraph ofÂ­fice and the office of the Colorado TeleÂ­phone company, the Hotel Victor on theopposite side of Fourth and the three greatshaft houses of the .Gold Coin Mining comÂ­pany and its ore bins, among the largestin the Cripple Creek district.Strong Wind Blowing.From there the flames were swept northÂ­ward by the half hurricane which wasblowing and never stopped until they hadtaken the Florence and Cripple Creek deÂ­pot and the fine new depot of the MidlandTerminal road at the head of Fourthstreet. All the buildings between theseare a total loss with practically their conÂ­tents, for the flames were so rapid in theirprogress that nothing could be saved.The scene of the great Cripple Creekfire were duplicated. Hurrying before theroaring flames went men, women and chilÂ­dren, carrying what they could snatchfrom the flames, racing for their lives.The crash of buildings torn asunder bydynamite and the crackle of the flamesas they consumed the dry buildings hastÂ­ened their flight and the pall of smokeadded a terror to the spectacle.Help From Other Towns.A special train was placed at the comÂ­mand of this city by the Florence &amp; CripÂ­ple Creek railroad and three companies offiremen, with apparatus were rushed tothe scene. They worked all afternoon ina vain endeavor to stay the march of theflames. The residence portion of the cityhas suffered comparatively little, but thebusiness is paralyzed and suffering isbound to follow. The first house wasbuilt in Victor in October, 1893. In Julyof the following year the city was incorÂ­porated and six years later it contained10,000 people. That is about the populaÂ­tion now.The Fire Under Control.The fire was gotten under control thisevening. Conservative estimates place theloss at $2,500,000.

America has a populationestimated at about 105,000,000, relaÂ­tively thinly scattered, and averagingaltogether not more than seven to thesquare mile. On all the islands of theoceans there are probably 10,000,000 ofinhabitant. The white people of thehugmn race are estimated at about 550,Â­000,000, the blacks at some 250,000,000;the reit are of intermediate color. Ofthe entire race some 500,000,000 arewell clothed, that is comfortably andentirely; 700,000,000 are partly clothed,and some 250.000,000 are practicallynaked. Some 500,000,000 may be saidtclhve in houses partly furnished withthe appointments of civilization, 800,Â­000,000 live in huts or caves with no atÂ­tempt at furnishing them with anyluxuries or Ecarcely conveniences, 260,Â­1)00,000 and more have nothing thatn-be-- -bE cd a hâ‚¬,mne.- Fuily threeÂ­flfths ofthe race, therefore, lie i.elowthe line which the civilization of theIAnglo-Saxon would fix as the lo'&amp;eatlimit at which deprivation and discomÂ­fort can be endured.

Chevrcul, the Gallic Owen Jones, hasrecently published a work entitled ""TheLaws of Contrast of Color."" Among thosubjects treated is one of universal interestfemale clothing. M. Chevrcul discussesthis with all the care it demands. And,first, he establ'shcd certain distinctions;that of the two types known as brunette iand blonde; that of the juxtaposition ofthe articles of toilet, whether pertaining tothe hair or to the complexion ; and that ofmodifications of the complexion: by colorÂ­ed rays emanating from the head-dressand which, being reflected on the skin,tinge it with their peculiar color. Hesays :The color of liirht bnirbeirnr essentiallvthe result of a mixture of red, yellow, and jbrown, we must consider it a very palesubdued orange brown; the color of theskin, although a lower tone, is analagousto it, except in the red parts. Llue eyesare really the only parts of the lair typewhich form a contrast of color with thewhole; for the red parts produce, with therest of the skin, only a harmony of analogyof hue, or at most a contrast of hue, andnot of color; and the part of the skin conÂ­tiguous to the. hair, the eve-brows and eye-laches ive rise only to a harmony of ana- jlogy, eitlicr of scale or of hue. The bar-monies of analogy, then, evidently predo- jinitiate i i the fair type over the harmonies ,of contrast j"" The type with black hair shows theharmonies of contrast predominating overthe harmonics of aualogy. The hair, eye- jbrows, eye-lashes, and eyes contract in tono :and colur, not only with the white of theskin, but aIo with the red parts which iu jthis type are really redder, or less roseate, jthan in the blonde type; and we must notforget that a decided red. associated with iblack, gives to the latter the character of;an excessively deep color, either blue or !green.""Of the colors of the hair end head-dress ':we are told : a i,;The colors which are usually consider- ied as assorting best with LL'ht or biuek jhair are precisely thoe which produce !great contractu; thus tky-blue, known to faccord well with blondes, it the color 'which approaches near-st to the coTT.pl'j- 'mentary of orange, which is the basis of jthe tint of their hair and complexions. jTwo coloi-3, long esteemed to accord favor- jably with black hair yellow, and red jmore or less orange contrast in the same !manner with them. 1 ellow ana orangered, contrasting by color and brilliancywith black, and their complernentaries, viÂ­olet and blue-green, in mixing with thetint of the hair, are far from producing abad result.iThe following on the colors of the com-1plexiou and the contiguous drapery, af-.fords several valuable hints: j""The juxtaposition of drapery with the jdifferent Mesh tints of women oilers to poi-,trait painters a host of remarks, which are ,all the reult ol the principle already l.k!ddown. Wo eh&amp;U state the moot g ac-ra!,thus:"" Cose red cannot be put in contrast with teven the loiest complexions without caus- jing them to lose some of their freshness. JUotse-red, maroon, and light crimson, have jthe serious disadvantage of rc-ndoring the jcomplexion more or h-. gre-a. This is Ishown in the following expeiim-snts-. Place jtwo sheets of f.cp-r of either of the above !color bs-side-tsvo sheets of frehcolored jpaper, when 'it will be seen how much thc-y jare mutually iiijurvd, the lighter becoming jgreenish and the darker rather of a violethue. 15y substituting light green for the !red, we sh.tll rind them mutually height- jened and improved. The height of torn; iof the green influences the result ; a verydeep green, acting by contrast of tone, so ;enfeebles the complexion that the slight icontrasts of iu colors will le inapprvcia-blc; a dep red. by contrast of analogy'blanches the complexion. It is necessary, ithen, to separate tiie rose from the skin in !sorao manner; and the simplest manner ofdoing this is to edge the draperies with aborder of tulle, which produces the effectof gray bv the mixture of white threads,which rctWt light, and the interstices,which absorb it; there is alo a mixture oflight and shade, which recalls the effect ofgray, like the effect of a casement windowviewed at a great distance. I'ark red isless objectionable for certain complexionsthan rose red, because, being higher thanthe latter, it tends to impart whiter.e s tothem in consequence of contiast of toiie.' Delicate green is, on the contrary, faÂ­vorable to all fair complexions which eredeficient in rose, and which may havemore imparted to them without disadvanÂ­tage. But it is not as favorable to comÂ­plexions that are more red than rosy; norto those that have a tint of orange mixedwith brown, because the red they add tothis tint will be of a brick-red hue. Inthe latter case a dark green will be lessobjectionable thad a delicate green.""Yellow imparts violet to a fair skin.and in this view it is less favorable thanthe delicate green. To those skins whichare more yellow than orange it impartswhite; but this combination is very dulland heavy for a fair complexion. Whenthe 6kin is tinted more with orange thanyellow, we can make it rosy by neutralizingthe yellow. It produces this effect uponthe black-haired type, and it is thus that itsuiLs brunettes."" Violet, the complimentary of yellow,produces contrary effects ; thus it impartssome greenish-yellow to fair complexions.It augments th yellow tint of yellow andorange skins. The little blue there may bein a complexion it makes green violet.This, thcu, is one of the least favorable coÂ­lors to tho skin, at least when it is not sufÂ­ficiently deep to whiteu the skin by conÂ­trast of tone."" Blue imparts orange, which combinesfavorably with white, and the light fleshtints of fair complexions, which have uaoieor less a determined tint of this color.Blue is thus suitable to most blonde, andin this case justities its reputation. It willnot suit brunettes, since they have alreadytoo much of orange.'Orange is too brilliant to be elegant; itmakes lair complexions blue, whitensthose which have an orange tint, and givesa green hue to those of a yellow tint."" Lustreless white, such as cambric musÂ­lin, assorts well with a fresh complexion,of which it relieves the rose color; but itis unsuitable to complexions which have adisagreeable tint, because white always exÂ­alts all colors by raising their tone ; conseÂ­quently it is unsuitab e to those skinswhich, without having this disagreeabletint, very nearly approach it.Very light ""whito draperies, such asmuslin or lace, apiKar more gray thanwhite. We must thus regard every whitedrapery which allows the light to passthmnoh ita interstices, and which is onlyapparent to the eyes by the surface opÂ­posed to that which receives incident lightBlack draperies, by lowering the toneof the colors with which they are in juxtaÂ­position, whiten the skin; but if the verÂ­milion, or rosv parts, arc somewhat distantfrom the drai-ery. it will follow that, alÂ­though lowered in tone, they appear relaÂ­tively to the white parts of the skin contiÂ­guous to the same drapery redder than ifnot contiguous to the black.""""Pa, didn't I",informational,yes390,60130082150,"a? though Jeffries could hardly walhis corner, and it semed certain tRING SIDE, CONEY I8LAND would be a new champion.

The mills are a complete wreck, and200 or 800 people are still supposed to be buried inthe ruinsAt present it is impossible to give anything like acorrect account of the loss of life, but, from the best aauthority, it is believed that at least two hundredare dead in tht ruins.Eighteen dead bodies have already been taken out,and some 25 mortally wounded, besides some 50 indifferent stages of mutilation.The agent of the mills, Mr. Chase, and the TrenÂ­surer, Mr. Howe, escaped by running from the fallÂ­ing building.It is impossible as yet to tell the cause of the disÂ­aster. ""Our reporter has just come from the ruins, andthe scenes there beggar all description. Some twoor inore acres of ground are piled up with everydescription of machinery, and the fallen.building.Huge bonfires are burning, to light some two orthree thousand persons who are working for theirlives to rescue the unfortunate persons, many ofwhom are still crying and begging to be releasedfrom their tortures.Every few minutes some poor wretch is draggedfrom his or her prison, and it is heart-reading tohear their cries as they are drawn out, with legs andarms crushed or torn out.One man shockingly mangled, and partly buriedutnder the bricks, deliberately out his Own throat toend his agony.The whole city seems in mourning. Many peopleare running through the streets, and with trantiocries are searohing the ruins.Temporary hospitals have been arranged for thosewho have been taken from the ruins.Many stand at the ruins, frigid with despair.Often a terrible crash, caused by the clearing away,threatens death to all those who may still be alive ]in the ruins.Gen. H. K. Oliver is active and conspicuous in diÂ­recting parties who are endeavoring to rescue thevictims of the disaster. Gangs of men with ropes.below, are constantly dragging out huge pieaes ofthe wreck which imprison so many. Some of therescuers are killed in their hum.e efforts.Since we left the scene of disaster, reports-areconstantly coming to us of more dead and dying.Surgeons are coming in from every quarter, andeverything that can be done at buch a painful moÂ­ment, is being done for the suffering victims of thefearful calamity, thÂ­ mystery of which will have tobe cleared up by an inquest.Second Despatch.Eleven P. S.-About 10 minutes of 0 o'clock thisafternoon, our citizens were alarmed by the cry offire, which pro:eeded from the Pemberton Mills,about four-fifths of which had fallen, a shapelessmass, without the slightest warning to nearly 800human beings who were then at work therein.The building had never been considered as staunchas it ought to have been. It was built about sevenyears since, and was then thought a sham; indeed,before the machinery was put in, the walls spread tosuch a degree that some 22 tons of iron stays wereput in to save the building from falling by its ownweight.The building appeared, from the best informationthat can now be gathered, to crumble and fall fromthe eastern corner, or end, towards the Duck Mill.It fell inwards, as if powerful:y drawn that way.The fire companies at once repaired to the spot, butthere being no fiSe, they at once set to workowith awill to remove the rubbish. They very soon reachedsome of the rooms, so that the dead and woundedwere taken out as fast as they could be reached.Mr. Charles Batobhelder helped remove some 26,in various conditions, some still living, others deadand terribly mutilated.Mr. Chase, the Agent, and Mr. Howe, the TreaÂ­surer, were both providenutially saved. They werein the spinning-room, conversing, when5 beingwarned by some unusual noise, both started for adoor which was, by orders, strictly prohibited frombeing unlocked, but it being the only possible exitthey tried that, and found it unaccountably open.They had no more than made their escape when thepart they had just left fell to the ground.Messrs. Chase, Clark, Tattersen, Melvin, andWinn, (Overseers and Clerks) are safe. Mr. Branch,an overseer, has not been found, and it is supposedhe is still under the ruins.The City Hall has been converted into a temporaryHospital for the dead and wounded, to remain thereuntil recognized by friendq.Scores of both dead and mangled and wounded arerecognized when taken from the ruins, and immedi.ately taken to their homes.The following wounded are now at the hall:Â­Mary Ann Coleman, Ellen Clary, Sarah Dole,Eliza Ward, Ellen Mahoney, Thomas Connor,Bridget Bradley, Kate Harykee, Joannab Comery.Morris Palmer, George tieodalpha, Mrs. Friedler,Robert Hays, - Courtuey, Mary York, Mar.garet Hamilton, Mary Hanueghill, Mary Kennedy,Elits Yaw.There are twenty-two corpses, only the followingof which have been recoqgnzed:--Â­Mary McDonald, John Dearborn, Bridget Ryan,Margaret Sullivan, Mike O'Brien, and Mr. Palmer.Mr. Palmer was deeply buried in the ruins at thetime, and, thinking there was no possibility of beingextricated, cut his own throat to end his sufferings,but still he was extricated and lived some time'afterarriving at the Hall.One woman in the part of the mill still standing,became frightened, threw her bonnet and shawl outof a fifth story door, and then jumped out herself,breaklng an arm and otherwise injuring herself sothat she cannot recover.The laboring force of the Mill was about 960. andit is supposed that about 700 beings were buri4q inthe ruins.11.80 P. M.-A woman has just been rescued, whosays there are some twenty-five more in the vicinityof the place from whence she was extricated, stillalive.One poor girl lies in the Hall badly hurt, attendedby her mother. She had only entered the Mill theday previous.A locomotive has just arrived from SManchlester,bringing four more physicians.The Building on Fire.About half-past nine o'clock, fire was discovered.This additional horror, although somewhat appreÂ­hended, struck terror to hearts that had heretoforebeen hopeful of saving more lives. Still, the workof removal went briskly on.the force-pumps in the vicinity, and all the handfire-engines, which had been kepit on the ground, atonce got streams of water on the fire. and have keptpouring on torrents, so that now (116 o'clock, .alÂ­though volumes ot smoke and steam are riisicl. yetthe fire does not seem to gain, and it is certainly tobe hoped that it has been stiayed.Those near the breaking-out of the fir6 were alÂ­Smoston the point of extricating a woman not badlyOUrt, oUL 1t0 names urove t0em uanc, agu ime wÂ­rman is supposed to have perished in the flames,when delivery seemed so near.The Mayor hasitelegraphed to Lowell for the fire-.men of that city, who will arrive here about oneo'clock.It is estimated that not less than 2000 able-bodiedmen have been counstantly at work on the ruins, but,notwithstanding so many at work in a small space,yet no accident that we can learn has occurred.MIDnmlaT.-Calamity succeeds calamity!-Withinthe past ten minutes the whole mass of ruins has beÂ­come one sheet of flame!The screams and moanings of the poor, buried,burning and suffocating creatures can be distinctlyheard, but no power on earth can esave them.THIRD DESPATCH.Half-past One A. ...-The Pemberton Mills arenow a flat, smoking mass.Brick, mortar and human bones are promiscuouslymingled.Probably not less than two hundred human beingsperished in the flames ! !The fire made quick work, burning not only themain buildings, as they lay flat, but spreadingto the material that had in kindness been reÂ­moved.The Washington Mills are in great jeopardy, thewind being towards the duck mill, the countingroom of which almost touches the Pemberton, andit is feared that may al o be sacrificed.FOURTH DESPATCH.Two o'clock a. m. -Through the almost auperhuÂ­man exertions of the firemen, the Washington Millsare now considered out of danger. Of the DuckI Mills the prospect is not so good. Men are activelyat work removing bales of co;ton, and such othermatters as appear in immenent danger.Everything is being done that can be thought ofto save property or life.Firecompanies are present from Methuen, AndoÂ­ver, Bradford, Haverhill, and Lowell.Between 40 and 50 persons are in attendance att the City Hall, and other places, wherever the inÂ­I jured need their services.The ruins having burned up, it will be maqy daysbefore a true knowledge of the number of killed andwounded can be arrived at.The fire, which finally sacrificed the buried humanbeings, caught, without doubt, from a lantern conÂ­taining fluid, which was accidentally dropped.One fireman dropped down dead in the street,probably from overheating.. His name is unknown.Â­The fembeaton Boarding Houses, in which nearlyall the operatives of the mills boarded, were at onetime in great danger from the conflagration, arenow safe.The streets of. the city, from one end to the other,are filled with one mass of human beings, every oneeager to reader assistance in any way or shape,'andall anxious to see or hear what may transpire.Friends of the operatives, who were alternating,previous to the bursting out of the flames, betweenI hope and fear, are now settling down in hopeless deÂ­9spair.After the fire, hope could no longer hold supremÂ­FIFay. IPTH DESPATCH.3 o'clock.--The Duck Mill will he saved, wiltbpuSa doubt.A steam fire engine has just arrived from Man-Â­chester.It seems more quiet -.now, and further damageprobably cannot occur from fire, as there is such alarge force of firemen on the ground:. .S t is utterly impossible to get fuller particularstonight, everything and, everybody being in the stÂ­most :confusion, and apparently, appalled and conÂ­founded by thisanightof:ntiparalled horrors.The amount of sufeeng cannot: be-imagined, andthe.exact number of killed and wounded it is utterlyImpossible to ascertain with itny degree of. certaity.Accideat",informational,no334,480010,"Albany, April 7.-Iu the Senate toÂ­night a bill, annulling tbe charter of theBroadway Surface Railroad of NewYork City, was passed by au almostunanimous vote.â– *ewd*riy Better.tJcRANTON, PÂ» , tpril 7.

Tho hank is steep andcovered with huge boulders and tnaaaea ofrock. When tbe train reached this pointthe track commenced to settle under itfor n diatauo covering ita entire length.The coaches broke from their trucks andwent over the precipice. The enginebroke from tbe tender, tearing np thetrack for twenty feet. Below rolled thoDeerfield river, on the very edge ofwhich the ears were thrown.

On arriving at thescone of the wreck a horrible aight waswitnessed. Darknesa bad settled overthe spot, but far down on the river bankcould be seen tbe smouldering embers ofthe holacanat. It was impossible to tellwho was hurt and who was killed.Stout hearted trackmen were loweredcautioualy down the treaeherona height,and the work of rescue began. MerrittPeeley, Superintendent of the NationalEx press Company. Boston, waa found onthe track and taken to the relief car.He had n wound four inchealong and half an inch wide overthe left temple. His left thighwaa broken, also the left leg at the knee,beaidea which he sustained internal inÂ­juries, from which he will die. O.

Trees are impatient of wet feet.                 Well drained lands are drier in wet spells and moister in dry spells than other lands. They can be worked earlier in spring.                 Good tillage increases the available food supply of the soil and also conserves its moisture.                 Trees should be made to send their roots deep into the soil, in order to fortify themselves against drouth. This is done by draining the soil and by plowing the orchard rather deep.                 This deep plowing should begin the very year the trees are set, and it should be continued every spring until the habit of the trees is established.                 Moisture is retained in the upper soil by very frequent but shallow tillage, by means of which the surface of the land becomes a mulch for the soil beneath.                 Tillage should be begun just as soon as the ground is dry enough in spring.                 This tillage should be repeated as often as once in ten days throughout the growing season, which extends from spring until July or August.                 Tillage should not exist for the mere purpose of killing weeds. Weeds leave taught the most important lesson in agriculture, to be sure, but the schoolmaster should now be able to retire.                 Late cultivation may be injurious by inducing a late growth. At all events, it can be of small utility when the tree begins to mature and rains become frequent. This season of respite gives the grower the opportunity of raising a green manure, and of adding fertility to his land at trifling expense and with no harm to his trees.                 Fall plowing may be advisable for farm . but it should be generally discouraged in orchards. The land in orchards should be left compact in the fall, and it is advisable to cover it with some close herbage.                 Only cultivated crops should be allowed in orchards                 early in the season. Grain and hay should never be grown.                 Nursery stock should not be grown in orchards.                 Even hoed or cultivated crops may rob the trees of moisture and fertility, if they are allowed to stand above the tree roots.                 ""Cnltivators "" is the best crop to raise in an orchard. Sod is sometimes allowable in apple and standard pear orchards, but never in other fruit plantations; but even then it should be pastured closely with sheep or hogs. If the stock is fed at the same time, the land will fare better.                 Watch a sod orchard. It will begin to fail before you know it.                 Probably nine-tenths of the apple orchards of New York State are in sod, and many of them are meadows. Of course they are failing.                 The remedy for these apple failures is to cut down many of the orchards. For the remainder, the treatment is cultivation, fertilizing, spraying-the trinity of orthodox apple growing.                 In general, level culture is best. The modern cultivators and harrows make such cultivation easy.                 Trees, especially apple, are often trained too high, because of the  of working close to them. Modern tools will bring the heads within reach.                 Harnesses with no projecting  nor metal turrets should be used in bearing orchards. Those requiring no whiffle trees are also useful.                 Potash is the chief fertilizer to be applied to fruit trees, particularly after they come into bearing.                 Potash may be had in wood ashes, and muriate of potash. It is most commonly used in the latter form. An annual application of potash should be made upon bearing orchards. Of the muriate, 500 to 700 pounds may be used to the acre in mature orchards.                 Phosphoric acid is the second important fertilizer to be applied  to orchards. It may be got as plain high-grade superphosphate (dissolved South Carolina rock), in the bone fertilizers, and perhaps in Thomas slag. Of the plain superphosphates, 30u to 50O pounds may be applied to the acre.                 Nitrogen can be obtained cheapest by means of thorough tillage (to promote nitrification) and  green manures. There is rarely occasion for buying it for fruit plantations. if the lands are properly tilled and cropped.                 Nitrogen promotes growth. It should, therefore, be used with some caution, for orchard trees should be grown for fruit rather than for timber.                 Barn manures are generally more economically used when applied to farm crops than when applied to orchards; yet they can he used with good results,  when rejuvenating old orchards.                 In , the commercial complete fertilizers are less rational for  than a fertilizer made for the occasion oat of  evidently needed by the trees; hut the )lete fertilizers give much better resuits than the prevailing indifference and neglect.                 Cultivation may be stopped late in the season, and a crop can then be sown upon the land. This crop many serve as a cover or protection to the soil and as a green manure.                 A green manure  the soil by adding fibre to it and by increasing its fertility",informational,yes177,25770131190,"acre ofach land, and also from owners of live stock who do not, occupyfor laud, hut cottagera' pigs aire excluded, as well as pigs keptin towns.

ChairmanWilson of the ways and means comÂ­mittee has made a statement in relationto the new tariff bill, saying it is meantto reform a vast labyrinthian system ofclass taxation. He details its main feaÂ­tures as follows:Firstâ€”The adoption, wherever itseemed practicable, of ad valorem inÂ­stead of specific duties.Secondly-â€”The freeing from taxes ofthose great materials of industry that lieat the basis of production.Specific rates of duty are objectionablefor these reasons: They frequently conÂ­ceal a rate of taxation too enormous tobe submitted to if exposed to ad valoremterms as the duty of 8 cents a hundredpounds on salt in bulk, which amountsto over 80 per cent on a common necesÂ­sary of life. They always bore heavilyon the common articles used by themasses and lightly on the expensive artiÂ­cles consumed by the rich, as a tax of $80on all houses would be little or nothingon the great mansion and very high onthe humble home.

After we had captured the camp by the advance of the 1st Wisconsin, they were mistaken for the enemy. I returned to this point lIst night, and shall move right on the MLacon road without waiting orders from you as directed, feeling that the whole object of the expedition is accomplished.

Stanton, Secretary of WVar:                 Lieut. Col. Harden, commanding lst Wisonsin, has just arrived at Irwinsville. Ie struck Davis's trail at Dublin, Lawrence county, on the evening of the 7th, and  l hini closely, night and day, through the pine wilderness of Alligator Creek and Green Swamp, via Cumberlandville to Irwinsville. At Cumberland Col. Harden met Col. Pritchard with 160 picked men and horses of the 4th Michigan. Harden followed the trail directly south, white Pritchard, having fresher horses, pushed down the Ocmulgee toward Hopewell, and thence to house Creek to Irwinsville, arriving there at midnight of the 9th. Jeff. Davis had not arrived. From citizens Pritchard learned that his party. were encamped two miles out of the town. He made his dispositions, and surrounded the camp before day. Harden had encamped within two miles; as he afterward learned, from Davis. The trail being too indistinct to follow, lie pushed on at 3 A. M.-and had gone but little more than a mile when his advance was fired . by men of the 4th Michigan. A fight ensued, both parties exhibiting the greatest determination. Fifteen minutes elapsed before the mistake was discovered.                 The firing during this skirmish was the first warning that Davis received. The captors report that lie hastily put on one of his wife s dresses and started to the woods, closely followed by our men, who at first though him a woman, but, discerning his boots while running. suspected his sex at once. Tue race was a short one, and the rebel President was soon brought to bay. Ile brandished a bowie knife of elegant pat. tern and showed signs of battle, but yielded promptly to the persuasion of the Captain's revolver, without compelling the men to fire. He expressed great indignation at the energy  which.  pursued, saying that he thought our government -was more magnanimous than to hunt down women and children. Mrs. Davis-remarked to Col. Harden, after the excitement was over, that ""the men had better not provoke the President, as he might hurt some of 'em.' -                 Rengin behaves himself with becoming dignity and resignation.

The Cimbria put to sea byat half-past two the same afternoon, and on Friday mornÂ­ gring, during a thick fog off Borkum, came into collision onwith the steamer Sultan, and received such damage as to hecause her to sink sheortly afterwards. Yesterday afternoon lo'on&amp; of her boats reached Cunxhavenl, with 39 of the pasÂ­ wisengers and crew.

The Sultan sustained severe damage, and Thas arrived in the Elbe.A Hamburg telegram, dated Sunday afternoon, says the 01:Cimbria sustained such severe injuries in the collision B:with the Sultan as to render it apparent that she must resink almost immediately. The officers of the vessel doaccordingly lost not a moment in trying every possible hemeans to save the lives of those on board. Life-belts were tidistributed among the passengers, and the order was ifgiven to lower the boats, which, however, owing to Mthe vessel keeling over, weas found to be very diffiÂ­ ticult of execution on one side of the vessel, and Mabsolutely impossible on the other.

News has just been received of the occurrence of a dreadful disaster at sea, resulting in the loss of over 520 lives. The scene of the occurrence was off the banks of Newfoundland, in the North Atlantic, and as is so frequently the case in that neighborhood, a dense fog prevailed at the time. The vessel overtaken by disaster was the French Atlantic liner La Bourgogne, ot 7395 tons, the property of the Generale Transatlantique Company. The steamer was on the passage from New York to Havre, and hud a total number of souls on board of 726. She is said to have been steaming at the rate .of 18 knots an hour, when she came into collision with the sailing Bhip Cromartyshire, of 1,554 tons, owned by Messrs. T. Law and Co., of Glasgow. .The vessels came together in such a'way that the bows of the Cromartyshire struck La Bourgogne on the broadside, and opened a great hole near her engine-room. Into this the sea poured at such a rate that she sank in a few minutes. The Cromartyshire made every endeavour to rescue the crew and passengers of La Bourgogne. On the French liner the boats and the deck-rafts were got out, and a number of these got safely away irom the vessel's side before she sank. Altogether, the Cromartyshire picked up 201 persons out of the 726 who were on board the sunken steamer. 'When the collision occurred and it became apparent to those on board La Bourgogne - that she was sinking rapidly terrible scenes in the struggle for life were enacted. The crew behaved with selfish cowardice, determined at all hazards to save their own lives. They took possession of the boats as they were 'being lowered, pushed the despairing passengers away with boat-hooks and oars, even cut the ropes to which the women were clinging, and actually threw women who had succeeded in getting into the boats out again. The 201 persons saved comprised 31 of the crew and 170 passengers. Amongst them ' was only one woman. ? The Cromartyshire was towed into Halifax, Nova Scotia, by the Grurian (? Cunard liner Etrurja).

The wires wherehe storm was were blown down andtelegraph reports are consequentlyeery meager. The first dispatch reÂ­vived by the Northern road said the:yclone passed three miles northeastif there at 3:50 p. m. A school housesear town was destroyed, the teachericilled and a number of children killedand injured. Have not been able tolearn exact number of names. Thewhole country In the path of thestorm is devastated. The Sioux City&amp; Northern tracks between Perkinsand Doon are washed out for severalmiles. Dispatches from Sioux CenÂ­ter at 8:30 p. m. say three schoolhouses and at least twenty residencesand barns were swept away. At the6chool houses two teachers and threepupils were killed and many inÂ­jured. Two women were found deadabout 6 o'clock not far from the pointwhere the school buildings stood. Oneman, who arrived at Sioux Centerlate in the evening, reported that hishouse was blown away' and his familykilled. He himself escaped and reÂ­ports that at least200 OR 300 PEOPLEmust have been killed. Parties havebeen sent out from Hull, Sioux CenÂ­ter and Orange City, neighboringtowns, but their work is being carÂ­ried on in total darkness in the midstof a tremendous wind . and rainstorm.

Thewires leading to it are all down, therailroad tracks are washed out andthe wagon roads cannot safely betraveled over owing ;to .the mannerin which they - were gullied by therain.It is consequently no easy matterto reach it. Physicians have alreadybeen sent from Hull,; Orange Cityand Sioux Center, but are findingevery conceivable obstacle in the efÂ­fort to reach the scene of the storm.Help has been refused from here, butif the same character of reports conÂ­tinue to come in, a^train may be sentout. â–  - :â€¢;'-- ;...';'-""-./-â– _â€¢;.| TRACK OF THE ; STORM.: Definite reports are beginning tocome in as to the path followed bythe cyclone.
