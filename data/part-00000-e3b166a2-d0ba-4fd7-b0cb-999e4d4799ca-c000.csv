which are usually supposed to attend all Courts. Pjo
rne can approach the present Queen without being
struck, not only with her easy and charming deportment, |
and tiiur peculiar softness of disposition and temper, for
which she is so remarkable, hut with the entire self command
and repose of manner, which might be expected
to guard a Sovereign of more advanced years and expert-nce
She has, besides, all the characteristic ban
naluril and good temper of the English. There was,
too, another thing which, I confess, gratified me, and
which I must not omit?and that is. the deportment of
the Queen towards the Duchess of Kent. 1 was a close
observer, in order to form an opinion ol the rumors which
a-e afloat, and which we see in the papers as to a coldness
between the moiherand daughter. There is no foundation
rihis In public, the predominant feeling, which marks
the deportment of the Queen, is properly that of sovereign
but ycu never fail to see displayed, upon all proper
occasions, and that in the kindest and most becoming
manner, the feelings of the daughter and mother. 1 could
give you. in proof <>f this, several anecdotes of a marked
and touching nature. As to her power and capacity for
governing, they, of course, ate yet to be developed. To
g 'Vern mankind, in '.hesedays,requires certainly Justice,
\ ir*ne, and Humanity, but not surpassing capacity

tary of War be requested to communicate his plan, in
detail, for there-organization of the militia of the I .
States/' I have the honor of submitting the following
Report
""The impossibility of guarding our exposed frontiers
by the sma.ll regular force of the United States, renders
it necessary that some plan should be devised to make
the militia available without burdening the country,
either by too great an expense in maintaining it in the
field, or by abstracting t<x> large a number of useful citi­
zens from the productive labors of cgricultuic or ol'
the mechanic arts.
''Tltc mass of the militia of the United States, ns at
present organized, dnot tall short of one million
five hundred thousand men; and every day that they are
mustered for inspection or exercise abstracts at least
one million of dollars from the earnings of hbor, with­
out adding any thine whatever to the military efficien­
cy of the country, and loo often affecting injuriously
the moral condition ofthose who are assembled for the
purpose. Left by the little instruction they receive on
such occasion, without discipline, subordination, or
knowledge of th<* use of arms, and totally ignorant of
the manner of taking care of themselves or of each
other in the field, such a militia, if called out in mass,
would rather prove a burden than an assistance to the
army employed in the defence of the country, as is
shown by the experience of General Washington, re­
peatedly expressed in his correspondence, as well ns
by the result of more recent events during the last war.
It is true that, in the principal cities of the United
States, there are to be found well organized, disciplin­
ed, and soldier-like companies, battalions, regiments,
brigades, and divisions of volunteers; men who, indi­
vidually and collectively, would do good service in the
field. But any one acquainted practically with war
knows that to fijht bravely, and even ty manceuvre
coolly and skilfully, on the field of bailie, are not the
most necessary qualifications of the soldier. Theylfre
perhaps, the most common, and the least often called
into action. Soldiers must be taught their duties in
garrison, and in the field, in marching and encamping,
in the police and military administration of an army,
This instruction, so essential, and without which it is
imposssible to form the soldier, cannot be given in a
day's training, by officers nearly as ignorant of these
branches of service as the soldiers themselves. I speak
of the generality of the militia officers. It must be im­
parted r>y veteran and skilful offices, in garrisop ana
in camp, and to men ami officers alike; and it must be
imparted to a few at a timf\ Any attempt to organize,
discipline, and render every way fit for service in the
field, the tin wieldly mass of the militia of this vest coun­
iry, which will soon ascend to two millions of men,
must tail for want of means, and leave the country ex­
posed to the terrible disasters which will attend the
first burst of war upon its frontiers, if they art; to be de<
fended by armed but undisciplined multitudes.
""It hasop?osupposed, that it will be sutficient to in­
struct the oificcrsonly, and thai the privates can, un­
der well instructed officers, be farmed ito soldiers in­
dtantly, by the magic voices of good commanders.
This is a double and moat dangerous error. In the first
place it requires time to form a soldier, under the most
practised, experienced, and skilful officers: and our soil
might be polluted by the foot of the invader, our cities
t&Ken and sacked, and our forts occupied, before our
armed citizens could be taught the elements of tactics,
or the simple use of the firelock. And, secondly, it
will prove a fatal error to suppose that an ollicercan
be formed by being drilled as a private. The habit of
command, the prompt eye, the firm tone, the self-pos­
MCMsioti in moments of difficulty and danger which in­
spire the pien with confidence and courage, nnd arc so
essential to secure their ready obedience, are the result
of practice. The officers and privates who are to act
together in the field, must be drilled together and prac­
tised, the one to the duties of obedience, and the other
to those of command.
?^Satisfied that an efficient force cannot be created by
drilling the officers alone, as well as of the impractica­
bility of rendering the whole mass of the militia avail­
able at the same time for the defence of the country,
and convinced, front the experience of our past wars,
that it is necessary to organize and discipline a select
body of citizen soldiers, vvlio, in a moment of danger,
will know their stations, and their duties when assem­
bled there, and who, although separated from the mass
for a short time, will return :nd impart to it the milita­
ry k nowledge and experience they have acquired du­
ring their period of service, I have prepared the plan,
the details of which are herewith submitted, agreeably
to the resolution of the House. It is believed that, on
examining them, it will be apparent that the ?eJi me is
not liable to any one of the objections tliS tti ? urged
against large standingarmies; but on the contrary, that
it will form a select body of well disciplined militia, rea­
dy themselves to defend their country in the hour of
danger against any sudden attack, a'nd furnishing a
corps around which the less instructed mass may raTly.
Possessing, in some degree, the military knowledge and*
skill of regular soldiers, they will be able alike to pro­
tect their country from a foreign foe, and to guard its
liberties from any danger that may threaten them.
""It appears to me that the organization now proposed
will prevent the necessity of maintaining large stand­
ing armies, even in time of war. The militia, properly
drilled and instructed, will be thereby rendered perfect­
ly efficient, and capable of defending the forts alongour
maritime frontier, which, in the absence of such an or­
ganization, would require a regular army of fifty thou­
sand men. At present, the militia cannot be rendered
immediately available against a surprise; whereas, un­
der the proposed organization, they would repair to
their stations at the first alarm, and","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024735/1840-04-10/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,vi_blass_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Richmond enquirer.,Thomas Ritchie,"Richmond, Va.","","",994,12363,3271,15218,4,20148,29994,0,vi_blass_ver01/data/sn84024735/00415664242/1840041001/0442.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richmond%2C_Virginia,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/vi_blass_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84024735%2F00415664242%2F1840041001%2F0442.jp2/pct:4.933492,41.218244,16.234862,50.736814/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/vi_blass_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84024735%2F00415664242%2F1840041001%2F0442.jp2/pct:4.933492,41.218244,16.234862,50.736814/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

of the heavy sea on. and the headway of theve*?el,
they both swamped as soon as they touched the

cried for help. There was no safety in tbe bca. The

in consequence of the wind had put into Dunkirk ?
She laid there till nearly sunset, at which time ahe ran
out, and had proceeded a* far as Barcelona, when just
at twilight, the fire of the Kr u was discovered some
?Jt> miles astern. The Clinton immediately put about
ai.d reached the burning wreck about 10. It was a
fearful sight. All the upper work* of the Erie had
lieen burned aw ty. The engine was standing, out
the hull wa? a mass of dull, red flame. The nassen­

gers and en*w were floating around, screaming in
thfi r agony an J shrieking for help. The boats of the
Clinton were instantly lowered and manned, and eve­
ry person that could br ween or heard wan picked op,
ami every possible relief afforded.
The L uij, a little steamboat lying at Dunkirk, went
out of that harbor as soon as jKissible, after the dis- \
covery of the fire, and arrived soon after the Clinton. \
It w?jh riot thought by the survivors that she saved !
any. By 1 A. M all wan still except the dead crack -
liny of the fne. Not a soli'ary individual could be
neen ??r heard on the wild waste of waters A line
was then made fast to the remains of the Erie's rud- !
der, and an effort made to tow the hapless hull ashore, j
About this time the Chautauque came up and lent I
her assistance. The hull of the Erie w\h towed with­
in about four miles of the shore, when it sunk iiwele­
ven fathoms water. By this time it was daylight.?
the lines were cast off The Clinton headed for this
port, which she reached about (> o'clock. Of those
who are saved, Several are badly burned, but none are
dangerously injured so f.ir as we have heard.
Oni'iis ""f thk Fiiik?Among the passengers on
board were six painters in tin employ of Mr. W. G.
Miller, of this city, who were going to Erie to paint
the steamboat Madison They had with them demi­
john-* filled wnb spirits of turpentine and varnish, ,
which unknown to Capt Titus, were placed on the
boiler d?rk directly over the boilers. One of the fire­
men, who was saved, sa^s In* hud occasion to go on 1

They wen* r?| laced but by whom is not known Im­
mediately previous to the bursting forth of the flames,
a* several on board have assured us, a slight explosion
wan heard The demijohns had probably exploded
with the heat, and their inflamable contents, taking
fire instantly, cummunicuted to every part of the boat,
which having been freshly vainiidied, caught as if it
had been gunpowder.
Not a piper nor an article of any kind was saved.
Of course it i- impossible to give a complete list of

is supported there, we will recognise you as Irishmen no
longer."" [Hear, hear, and cheers.] But is that all that
can be said against slavery? Can any thing be more
dreadfully destructive of morality? 1 am prevented, by
the presence in which I speak, from entering as iully
into this subject as 1 might before a more select, but less
pure aHditorv than the present; but, 1 ask,can there be
morality under a system which prevents the marriage
state, or where those who are married to-day may be
forced from each other to-morrow; where the husband is
sold to one slave owner, and the wife to another; and
where the children may be torn from the parents and
sent elsewhere? Can there be morality where the power
of the master over the female slave is unlimited, and
where no passion is so brutal that it has not the means of
its gratification? I say the man is not a Christian?he
cannot believe in the binding law of the decalogue?he
may go to the chapel or the church, and he may turn up
the whites of his eyes, but he cannot kneel as a Christian
hufore his Creator, or he would nat dare to palliate such
an infamous system. No. America, the black spot of
slavery rests on your star spangled bannet; and no matter
what glory you may acquire beneath it, the hideous,

uamuing stain ol slavery remain* upon you ; ami a just
Providence will, sooner or later, avenge itself lor your
crime. [Loud an 1 continued cheeis.] Sir, I have spoken
the sentiments of the Repeal Association. [Rtnru-fH cfieets.]
The it is nnf a man antimcst the hundreds of thousands that
belong to our body, or amonest the millions that will belong |
to it, who does not concur in what I stated We may not
get money from America after //its declaration; but even if
we should not, w* do not want blood stained money. [Hear,
bear.] If they make it a condition ol their sympathy, or
if there be implied any submission to the doctrine oi slavery,
on our part, in receiving remittances, let them cease
sending it at once.""
At the close of his speech, Mr. O'Connell said :?
"" My countrymen, we deserve a better fate than we
have yet enjoyed; and li t me toll you that we will tind
much of generous sympatbv from America, telling us
that we are too good to continue iu a state of thraldom :
and when we obtain our moral force triumph, we will
assist in rescuing the slave in every land on the face of the
earth "" [Loud ch?er? ]
This is sufficiently plain and decided. And that
the great Agitator expresses as he eays, the sentiment
of the whole mass of Repealers, is unquestionable.
Are the patriotic American orators, who
have so valiantly rallied under the banner of Repeal
in this country, prepared to go the same length 1
Are they to be understood as adopting the whole renpnl
rrppH r? nrnmn!a?t#?H Kv iturrrpuf nnrtaflp 1 At

all events, this movement has now taken a new
turn, which will not lessen its interest and difficulty
here. Irish repeal and the emancipa'ion of the
slave, are now indiseslubly linked together?at
least, the union is consummated as far as Mr.
O'Connell can effect that result.

isa than eighty-one millions of dollars?of which
wenty-aeven millions are paid to the government
ipon the imports, and fifty-four millions to the proected
classes, in enhanced prices of similar domestic
rticlea.
This estimate ia based upon the position that the
uty is added to the price of the import, and also of
La domestic rival. If the import ia enhanced in
trice by the duty, so must be the domestic rival; for,
eing like articles, their price must be the same in

ne nnme mantel. ihe merchant advance* in cash
lie duty on the import, and adda the duty, with a
irofit upon it, and other charges, to the price?which
nusl therefore he enhanced to that extent; utiles*
he foreign producer had first deducted the duty
rom the price. But this is impossible; for sucn
iow is, and long has been, the superabundance of
apital and active competition in Europe, that
irofit of six per cent, in any business is sufficient to
iroduce large investments of money in that busiifss;
uud if, by our tariff, a duty of forty per cent.
ie exacted on the products of such business, and
he foreign producer deducts that duty from his pre ious
price, he must sustain a heavy loss. This
ass would also soon extend beyond the sales for our
onsumption to sales to our merchants of articles,
0 be re-exported by them from our ports with a
Irawback of duty, which would bring down their
irice throughout the mqrkets of the world. But
his the foreign producer cannot afford. The duty,
here fore, must be added to the price, and paid by
he consumer?the duly constituting as much a part
if the price, as the cost of production.
If it be true that, when a duty of forty per cent,
s imposed by our tariff, the foreign producer first
leducts the duty from tire previous price on the
ale to our merchant, it must be equally true with
1 duty of one hundred per cent., which is exactly
iqual 'to the previous price, and, when deducted,
vould reduce the price to nothing.
The occasional fall in price of aome articles after a
ariff, is no proof that this was the effect of the tariff,
lecause, from improved machinery, diminished
iricea of the raw material, or other causes, prices
nay fall even after a tariff, but they would in such
ases have fallen much more but for the tariff. The
rueat comparison ia between the present price of
he same article at home and abroad; and to the exen
t that the price is lower in the foreign market
han in our own, the duty, if equal to that difference,
mir.t to that extent enhance the priee, and in the
;nmc ratio with the lower duty. The difference in
irice at home and abroad is generally about equal to

hat difference if the duty be higher than that difference
or equal to it, or if the duty be lower, then
lie enhancement is equal to the duty; and if the
irticle is produced, like cotton, more cheaply here
ban abroad, the duty is iooperstive. The great argument
for the tariff is, that, foreign labor being
dieaper than our own, the cost of foreign produeion,
it is said, is lessened to that extent; and llint we

Wild Woman of the Navidad. —About a year
since an account Was published in the Victoria Ad­
vocate respecting a strange , creatirre, whose tracks
had been discovered on the banks of the Navidad,
near Texana. The footmarks uf this creature re­
sembled those of a woman, and a repoFt was cir­
culated to the effect tiuit a wild woman had made
her retreat in the forests of the Navidad. Within
a few weeks several attempts have been made to
capture this singular being. Mr. Glascock pur­
sued it for several days with dogs, and at one time
approached so near it as to cast a lasso upon its
shoulders. It, however, with great adroitness
eluded the snare, and fled to a dense thicket, where
it could not be traced. Mr. Glascock states that
he was near a small prairie enclosed by the border
forests of the river, when the creature emerged from'
the woods, and ran across the prairie in full view.
It was about five feet high, resembling a human
being, but covered with hair of a reddish brown
color. In its hand it held a stick about six feet
long, which it flourished from side to &de, as if to
regulate its motions, and aid jt when running ^t
full speed. Its head and neck are covered wilh very
long hair, which streamed backwards in the wind.
It ran with the speed of a deer, and was soon out
of sight. The dogs pursued it, and came so close
upon it at a small creek, that it was çompelled to
drop ils stick, which was taken by its.pursuers.
This slick is about »ix feet long, straight and
smooth a? if* polished wilh glass. Several ollwr
persons have rejeaiedly seen the creature, and ihey
all concur in ^presenting it as a human being, hut
so covered with shaggy hair as to resemble an Ou­
rang Ouiang. It has frequently appreached the
houses of tlie settlers in that neighborhood during
the night and stole varions articles; among other
things it carried* off a quantity of towels, one
iwo hooks, and has also taken several pigs?: One
of its nesfs was found in the foresi, in which wert
several napkins folded up just as they were laker
from the house, and a Biljlç marked J. J. Wrichi
A bill for washing was also enclosed in the Bible
The foot marks of this strange being have often
been traced in the bottom of the Navidad, but it
has eluded all ailempis lo capture it. . The old sel­
liers in that section »ay that these foot mirks ha
been noticed for ten or twelve years, aud that sc.v
ral years ago ihere were other foot marks, indicating
that three of these creatures were in cqmpany,
Within the last year the loot marks of only one
have b en noticed. Mr. Glascock intends u> col­
lect a pack of good hounds and resume the pursuit,
arid he is confident «hat he will succeed in captur­
ing it. He has incurred comdderaMe expense, and
has exposed himself lo great hardships and danger
to secure it, thus evincing his full belief in the
identity of this mysterious being. It is not improba­
ble that during tht war of the revolution when the
people of that reeiioQ were driven from their homes
by ihe victorious army of Urrea, some children
might have been secreted in the woods or left
there, and their relations never returning, have be­
come like wild beasls, clothed with hair, aud feed­
ing upon herbs nnd such small animals as they can
capture or pilfer from the seitlers.

. In a cold night of November, in the year of
182o, a man enveloped in a cloak, rapped at
the door of one of the most distinguished ad­
vocates of Paris. He was quickly shown into
the chamber of the learned lawyer. ' ""
- 'Sir,' said he, placing upon the table a large
parcel of papers, 'I am rich; but the suit that
has been instituted against me to-day will en­
tirely ruin me. . At my nge a fortune is not
to be rebuilt; so that the loss -of my suit will
condemn me forever to the most frightful mis­
ery. "" I come to ask the aid of your talents.
Mere are the papers ; as to the facts, 1 will, H
you please, expose them clearly to you.' A . j
llie advocate listened attenively to the stran
ger; then opened the parcel, examined all the
papers it contained, and said 'Sir, the action
laid against you is founded in justice and mor­
ality.: , Unfortunately, in spite of the admira­
ble perfection of. our codes, law does not al
ways accord with justice, and here the law is
for you. If therefore, you rest strictly upon
the law, and avail ""yourself without exception
of all the means' in your favor; if, above all,
these means are exposed with clearness and
force, you will infallibly gain this suit, and no­
body can afterwards dispute that fortune which
you fear to lose.' .
'.Nobody m the world replied the client, 'is
so competent to do this as yourself. , . An opin­
ion drawn up in this sense and signed by you
would render rae invulnerable. I am bold
enough to hope that you will not refuse it to
me.' ""
The skillful advocate reflected for some mo
ments, and taking up again the papers which
he had pushed away with an abruptness pecu
liar to him, said that he would draw up the
opinion, and that it should be finished the fol
lowing day at the same hour.
The client was punctual to bis appointment.
The advocate presented him with the opinion,
and without taking the trouble to reply to the
thanks with which the other overwhelmed
him, said to him rudely ;
ivre is the opinion ; there is no judge, who,
after having seen that, will condemn you.
Uive me 3,000 trancs V
The client was struck dumb and motionless
with surprise.
.'xou are free to keep your money,' said the
advocate, ""as I am to throw this opinion into
the fare.' .- - 1 :
So speaking, he advanced towards the chim
ney; but the other stopped nun, and declared
that he would - pay the sum demanded, but
that be bad only bolt ot it with bim. "" ' :
He drew, in fact, from bis pocket book
1,500 francs -in .bank-notes. ""The advocate
with one hand took the. notes, and with the
other threw the opinion into a drawer. .
'But,' said the client, '1 am going, it you
please, to give you my note for the remainder.'
1 want money, tiring me l.suu moreirancs,
or you shall not have one line.' -
There was no remedy, and tbe a,uuu lrancs
were paid ; but tbe client, to revenge himself
of being so pillaged, hastened to circulate this
anecdote. : It got into tbe papers, and tor a
fortnight there was a deluge of witticisms of
all Kinds upon the disinterestednes ot toe
great advocate. Those who did not laugh at
it, said it was deplorable that a man of such
merit should be tainted with a vice so degrad­
ing as avarice. . Even bis friends were moved
by it, and some oi them went so tar as to re­
monstrate with him publicly; but the only re
ply he gave ""was by shrugging his shoulders,
and then ' as everyteing is quickly forgot at
.Paris, people soon ceased to talk oi this.
leu years bad passed. Une day the Uourt
of Cassation, in its red robes, was descending
the steps of the palace of Justice, to be pres
ent at a public ceremony. All at once a fe
male darts from the crowd, throws herself at
the feet of the procureur-cenerat, seizes the
end of his robe and presses it to her lips.
1 he woman is looked upon as deranged, and
they try to drag her away. "" .
'Oh, leave me alone, leave me alone, she
cries, 'I recognize him it is he, my preserver!
Thanks to bim, I have been able to bring up
my large family. 1 hanks to him, my old age
is'haDDv- Ob. vou do not know me. One
day- I was very unhappy then I was advis
ed to bring an action against a distant relation
of my last husband, who"" had possessed him
self of a rich heritage tnat ought to nave come
to my children. Already 1 had sold half of
my goods to begin, the action, when,' one eve
ning-, 1 saw enter my bouse a gentleman, wno
said td me 'Do not' go to law; reason and
morality are for you, but the law is against
you. Keep tbe little you nave, ana aaa it to
these three thousand .francs, which are truly
yours.' I remained speechless with surprise.
When I would bave spoten and tnanKed mm,
he had disappeared;' but the' bag of money
was there, upon my table, and the counten­
ance of that generous man was engraved upon
my heart, never to be erase. Well this man
this preserver of my family is here! .. Let
me thank bim before liod and Detore men !""
The court had stopped. "" The procureur
general appeared moved, but conquering his
emotions, be said ,;. : . .- , v,
Take away this good woman, and take care
no harm comes to her. I dont think she is
quite right in her mind.'

ly interesting He found, as been stated, a chanw

the inscription* on which, we now learn, are
stamped in, so that though Major Kawlinson tuiakr
it very probable that these tablets may be re cor Is

of manifestos for issuing to the people or their immediate

twenty-five cases are on their way to England. In
the pyramid at Nuniou, also, a unique toattie ha*
been discovered. It is from four to five feet in

in my rambles about the vi Inge of Baalbek
I was struck with the beamy of the children,

Arab mothers. 1 &aw sevtial young females,
not more than twelve or foarteeu years of age,
with babies in their arms, evidently their own:
and i was told that tnis is quite common
throughout Syria. Many o| the v omen are
very beautiful—much moie so 1 think than
either the Circassian or the J urkieh women.
It was quite enchanting, their fine complexions
dark eyebrows, and flashirgeyes; and for regu­
larity and delicacy of features 1 have seldom
seen them equalled, except iu oth r parts ot Sy­
ria. In Nazareth 1 saw’ some oi the best form­
ed and most beautiful women I had ever seen
in any country ; I believe it is noted as mveh for
the beauty of its female population among
tourists, as for its historical interest; but at no
place did I see what 1 really thought approach­
ed the perfection ol beauty m so high a degree
as in Bethlehem. The women of Bethlehem
are absolutuly bewitching. I never saw such
perfect profiles, such eyes anil eyebrows, and
such delicate little hands and feet. Not that
I mean to say that they are are all to be compa­
red in all the higher attributes of Deamy to our
own fair country-women, for that would he
sacrilege. There is nr thing in the Hast, or in
Europe either, or any where else that I have
ever visited, to compare with tjie ladies of
Philadelphia, Balnmore, and Washington.—
Talk of Parisian beauties! Lively and vivacious
they are, to be sure; but not dignified, riot
queenly, not gentle and modest. Talk of En­
glish beauties! Grand enough, fair, but not
graceful,and stifi as buckram. Italian beauties;
dark, dull and greasy. German, fat and florid;
Turkish, tallowy and buttery: all well enough
in their way; but Mashalla! it won’t do to men­

Crying Babies.—The subjoined article is
■ *nt to the New York Sun by a correspondent.
We copy it for the sake of humanity.

Having heard of an important discovery,
made some years ago, of a ready mode of si­
lencing squalling children, 1 lately, on board
of a car, on my way from Newark here, em­
braced an opportunity of testing its virtues,
with the most satisfactory result, upon one of
the loudest and mest incorrigible little sqnai­
lers, 1 think that ever shocked my weak nerves.
The process is a very simple one—all I did
was to press one finger gently and repeatedly
across the cartilage of the child's nose, and iii
less than a minute, to the great amusement of
the passengers it was sound asleep. Believ
ing 60 desirable a piece of information should
be generally known, 1 have concluded to give
it publicity.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024738/1852-08-27/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,vi_manowar_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The daily dispatch.,J.A.

the convention held at Biltimore lust winter. The objeet o.
this movement is to establish more dire''! r>>mmerrial Inter
course between (tie Southern Atlantic cities and Europe ?
A Washington papers gives ihe following condensed pro­
giamme of the purposes of the South:
' The establishment of a continonlul depot of cotton, In
opposiiion to Liverpool.
""The direct exportation of cotton by the planter, thus do­
ing away wit!, middle men, middle warehouses, middle com­
mission?, mulole insurances, and ail that interminable rneli­
um which eat? up our substances and concentrates our ex­
ports at Liverpool.
'?To build up u Southern Importing market, in opposition
to New Voik.
?? To establish, through railroad alliance, more sympathy
with'tho litest West and iho North-wt-st, socially, commcr
elully, and nationally.
""To have one or more lines of steamers to Europe
""To induce emigration through Southern ports tn pass to
the West by a cornmunicallon always open, expeditious and
cheap; or t.< settle on our fertile lands.
""T? stimulate manufactures and general industry.
""To educate our children at homo, to spend our w-galrh ai
tiorne
""To sirn at commercial and industrial independence.""
Of ihe propose""! convention ths National (Naw Vjrki
Democrat says
It is fashionable for our city papas 10 sneer at this move­
menton tho part of the South. Bui it will be no sneering
matter if ilie plan i3 prosecuted with spirit and determina­
tion. If the Southern Atlantic cities arc connected, bv rail
roads, wi:h the Mississippi riycr, and with the Pacific ocean,
hy a great national rail road, it will soon make some mil­
I lions of d""il!ts iifierenrejn the commercc of this city. We
have no idea that New- York Is to be broken down ; but,
that large draughts of commerce may be made upon It, by
shis operation. ?'c have no doubt. Our Legislature has re­
fused to pass a iiw of simple jHstice to our Southern breth­
ren, and it w ill oc sirangclf our persistent ill-will towards
them docs not drive them to act on the defensive. The
passaci of ;tic bill Introduced by Mr. Taylor, would bring
many millions of dollars of trade from Ihe South to New
York.
The law alluded to was one prop-sing to allow Southern
citizens, removing with their slaves, to pass throush the
territory or ports of New York, without incurring the Les
of their slaves.
We have little faith in Southern commercial independence

in Loudon for the purposo of hiring out
umbrellas and parasols in wet and sultry weathor;
the borrower to lodge a shilling for the safe return

beev in times post, or may be in the future, by any other
aovereignTV^er. There is nothing in the doctrinc here­
? in maiutained or in the history of this Government to
Awaken the slightest apprehension that it is in any way j
Inclined to extend the shield of its protection over adven-,]
turers or seditious propagandists who may go from this :
*0 other countries to engage in enterprises designed to :
interfere wjth their political institutions or disturb their
internal quiet. The liberal policy of the United States in
regard to receiving immigrants from all uations and ex.
tending to them the advantages of their free institutions
Stakes it an act of justice on their part to maintain the
right of national protection to the full extent authorized
by the law of nations, aud to resist with firmness any at­
tempt to impose new restrictions upon it.
There is another view of this case which places the con­
duct of the agents of this Government at Smyrna upon
equally defensible grounds. The American Cousul there
and the American Lfcgatiou at Constantinople acted with
great caution in relation to Koszta's claim to be regarded
as entitled to the protection of this Government. As his
naturalization had not been perfected, they hesitated at
first to receive him uuder their protection ; but the facts
show that they ultimately yielded to his application, lie
received from each a Itzktreh?in effect a certificate?
that the person to whom it is given is cared for, and re­
ceived uuder the protection of the Government whose
agent has granted it.
By the laws of Turkey and other Eastern nations the
consulates therein may receive under their protection
strangers and sojourners whose religion and social man­
ners do not assimilate with the religion and manners of
those countries. The persons thus received become
thereby invested with the nationality of the protecting
Consulate. These consulates, and other European estab­
lishments in the'East, are iu the constant habit of open­
ing their doors for the reoeption of such inmates, who are
received irrespective of the country of their birth or alle­
giance. It is not uncommon for them to have a large
number of such proteges. International law recognises
and sanctions the rights acquiesced by this connexion.
, "" In the law of nations as to Europe, the rule in, that men
take their national character from the general character of the
country in which they reside; and this rule applies equally
to America, Dat in Asia and Africa an immiscible character
Is kept up, and Europeans trading under the protection of a
factory take their national character from the establishment
under tvhich they live and trade. This rule applies to those
parts of the world from obvious reasons of policy, because fo­
reigners are not admitted there, as in Europe 'and the west­
ern part of tho world/ Into the general body and mass of the
society of tho nation, but tbey continue strangers and sojour­
ners, not acquiring any national character under the general
sovereignty of tho country.""?(I. Kent's Com., 78-'D.)
The Lords of Appeals in the H;gh Court of Admiralty
m Englaud decided in 1784 that a merchant carrying on
trade at Smyrna, under the protection of a Dutch consul,
was to be considered a Dutchman as to his national cha­
racter.?(Wheaton's Inter. Law, 384., 3 Rob. Adm. Re­
ports, 12.) This decision has been examined and ap­
proved by the eminent jurists who have since written
treatises on international law.
According to tKe principle established in this case,
Koszta was invested with the nationality of the United
States, if ho had it not before, the moment he was under
the protection of the American Consul at Smyrna and
the American legation at Constantinople. That he was
Bo received is established by the tezhcrth they gave him
and the efforts they made for his release. The Charge
d'Affaires ad interim of the United States at Constanti­
nople, in a letter of tho 29th of June, addressed to the
imperial Internuncio, states : "" It was on presenting this
declaration of allegiance to the consulate of the United
States of America at Smyrna and to this legation that
the said Koszta was furnished with a tezhereh to come to
Constantinople and to return to Smyrna, whence he was
to start for New York. Since his arrival in Turkey he
has resided under the protection of my Government, and
it is a pleasure to mc to be able to state that his conduct
has always been irreproachable.""

American establishments, he had thereby acquired, ac­

An amusing affair happened lntely be­
tween a coal dealer and a purchaser. The lat­
ter was very anxious to see that the former did
not cheat him, so he (the purchaser,) inspected
the weighing of the coal himself, and felt perfect­
ly satisfied that he had got his full allowance,
without any desire on the part of the coal dealer
to “shave.” However, while the coal was weigh­
ing, the driver could not help laughing, aware
at the time that the pu chaser was particular
about his full weight of coal. The purchaser
noticing the laughing of the driver aslced him,
when he received his coal, what it was nil nbout,
so the driver told him. “Why,” said he, “when
your coal was weighing you were standing on the
scales, and were weighed with it.” “Is it possi­
ble? why I weigh nearly two hundred pounds !”
“Well sir,” said the driver, “you ere sold!”
“Yes” was the reply, “and I have bought myself
too.”

Below will be found ii letter from General Cans,
defining fully and clearly hit* views upon Kuow­
uothingism and the power of CongreiM over the
Territories:
Detroit, August l2)it 1855.
To the Editor of the Detroit Free Press :
Sir: The public journala contain a letter dated
July 24th, written by General Houatou, which
has just met my eye, and in which he aaya he per­
ceives, by the papers of the day, that ""General
Cass has approved the platform of the American
Order, us proclaimed to the world by the conven­
tion at Philadelphia."" I had observed the state­
ments to which General Houston alludes, and
had let them pass unnoticed, for it would be a
hopelesa task to endeavor to correct all the mis­
apprehensions and misrepresentations to which it
is my lot, as well us that of all other public men,
to be exposed in these days of party strife. And,
indeed, I could not suppose that such assertion*
would deceive any one who had heard or had
reud my remurks in the Senate of the United
States, on the 5th of February last, upon the pre­
sentation of the resolutions of the Legislature of
Michigan, instructing the senators of that State
to vote for an act of Congress prohibiting the in­
troduction of sluvery into the Territories of the
United States. Upon that occasion, while de­
clining to comply with those instructions, 1 took
the opportunity to express my sentiments in rela­
tion to the new political movement, which sought
to acquire and exercise power by secret combina­
tions^ bound Wether by the sanction of an oath,
which, it is Baiu, made it the duty of its members
to surrender their individual convictions to the
expressed will of a majority of their associates. I
then observed:
""Strange doctrines a^e abroad, and strange or­
ganizations are employed to promulgate and en­
force them. Our political history contains no
such chapter in the progress of our country, as
that which is now opening. The questions of
constitutionality and policy, which have been so
long the battle-cry of parties, are contemptuously
rejected, and intolerance, religious and political,
finds zealous, and it may be they will prove ^b­
cessful, advocates in this middle of the nineteenth
century, boasting with much self-complacency of
its intelligence, and in this free country, founded
upon immigration, and grown prosperous and
powerful by tolerations ? * * We want no
new parties, no new platforms, no new organiza­
tions, and the sooner these dangerous efforts are
abandoned, the better will it be for us, and for
those who are to follow us in this heritage of free­
dom.""
I might well suppose, after the expression of
these views upon the floor of the Senate, and
under circumstances of peculiar responsibility,
that any further action on my part would be un­
necessary to provo my consisiency, as a disciple
of the school of Wabliington, and Jefferson, and
Madison, and Jackson, in the rejection of a dan­
gerous innovation, inconsistent with all the prin­
ciples those patriots taught, and which, in effect,
awns to transfer the great political duty of an
American citizen from the light of day, where it
should be exercised in this land of freedom, to
secret conclaves, as unfriendly to calm investiga­
tion, as to wise and patriotic decision. But the
extract from the letter of 'General Houston has
shown me tlnvt these reports have received more
credit than I had believed, and this consideration
has induced me thus publicly to notice and to
contradict them. My opinions, indeed, upon any
subject are but of little consequence except to
myself, but, if they are worth refeiring to, they
ar? worth the trouble of making the reference a
true one.
I have no sympathy with this plan of political
organization?nono whatever; neither with the
means it employs, nor the objects it seeks to at­
tain. Its secrecy, its oath-bound obligations, its
eontrol of the ballot-box, its system of proscrip­
tion, striking both at political rights and religious
duties, and its inevitable tendency to array one
portion of the community against another, and
to carry deadly feuds intrf every corner of the
land, of which wo have just had a terrible proof,
written in characters of blood, and are doomed to
have many more, if this movement goes on, for
this is but the first instalment of death, and how
many others are to follow, and to wl^at extent,
and when the last is to be paid, and after what
lamentable vicissitudes, is known only to Him
who foresees events and can control thein?these
characteristics mark it as the most dangerous
scheme which has ever been introduced into our
country to regulate its public action or its social
condition. It is the Orangeunn of a republic,
scarcely better in principle than its monarchical
prototype?of a republic whose freedom and
equality justify as little as they invite the intro­
duction of a machinery whose operation ia con­
cealed from public observation, but whose conse­
quences are as clear as they are alarming.
Gen. Houston gives credence to the report that
I approve "" the platform of the American order,
as proclaimed to the world by the Convention at
Philadelphia."" I am aware that changes have
been made, both in the name and in some of the
principles of this new organization. But these
changes do not remove my objections to it. Its
spirit of exclusion and intolerance remains, and,
with it, its evils and dangers. It /s a book to
which I cannot be reconciled, whatcvor edition,
whether the new one or the old one, is offered to
me. I here is indeed, one principle laid down in
that convention which meets my concurrence,
axd that is, the declaration that ""Congress
ought not to legislate upon the subject of sla­
very, within the territory of the United States.""
I regret, however, that the body which thus pro­
nounced against the exercise of the power did
not also pronounce against its existence, but
carefully pretermitted?to use its own words?the
j expression of any opinion upon that point. Still,
I approve its action upon the subject, so far as it
goes. It is a step in the right direction, and I
should rejoice to see it followed by every politi­
cal party in our country. It is a step, too, tow­
ards the security of political rights?this opposi­
tion to the legislation of Congress over the inter­
nal affairs of the people of the Territories, and,
among others, over the relation of master and
servant, or that of husband and wife, or parent
and child ; for these matters of domestic policy
are subjects which should bo left to the Territo­
rial communities, and to divest them of the
power to regulate them, is an act of unmitigated
despotism. The negation of all power of inter­
ference by Congress in the internal government
of the Territories is the true constitutional doc­
trine, and the only safe and practical one, and I
am rejoiced, that, after years of opposition?of
obloquy, indeed?it is fast establishing itself upon
impregnable grounds.
1 he misapprehension which has prevailed upon
this grave subject is among the most extraordi­
nary political events of my time. One would
naturally suppose, that in ihis country, the dog­
ma of internal government by an irresponsible
legislsture ovor a distant community, unrepre­
sented in the ruling body, would find but little
favor, and that the power to establish and put in
operation a government might well be defended,
w hile the power to control all the concerns of
human life would lie left without an advocate.
The difference is broad and practical, and should
l>o the dearer to us, as it was the very considera­
tion urged hy our Revolutionary fathers in their
contest with the mother country, which began
hy argument, hut ended by arms. It was asserted
as early as 1774, when the Continental Congress
declared that the English colonists ""are entitled
to free and exclcrivf power of legislation in
their several provincial legislatures, where their
right of representation can alone be preserved,
in nil cases of taxation and internal policy, Sic.""
In that great struggle, the patriots who conducted
it conceded to the British Parliament the authori­
ty to organize colonial governments, but denied
their right to touch the internal policy of the
people. And for the support of that great prin­
ciple, denied and derided as it is now, thev went
to war.
I observe that a highly respectable and intelli­
gent gentleman, Governor Hunt, of New York,
in a letter just published, speaks of the Nebras­
ka bill as "" based on the absurd theory exterrito­
rial sovereignty. I never heard a man support
that measure or approve it for such a reason.?
Gov. Hunt has mistaken the sneers of its ene­
mies for the views of its friends. The Nebraska
bill rests upon no such theory?upon no theory at
all, but upon the stable foundation of the federal
constitution, and of tho natural rights of man.
I know of no one who claims sovereignty for
the Territories. All concede their dependence
upon the United States. But within this rela­
tion, there are mutual rights and duties, and the
questions?what power may Congress lawfully
exercise, and are the people of the Territories
divested of all rights?must be determined, not
by politico-metaphysical considerations, arising
out of the attribute of sovereigr^, but by the
Constitution of the United States. To the law,
and to the testimony, By the Constitution, the
goncral government is a government, not only of
granted, but limited powers, and Congress can

exerciso no authority winch if nut given by tin*
great charter that brought it into existence. Let
any uian j?ut hut finger upon the oiMt?c of that
instrument which confers this power of internal
interference, and I will abandon the principle, ax
long aa it haa been cheriahed by me, and that
is many years, aa will appear by reference to the
Globe ol March 31st, lo3~, which contains an
article written by me, and entitled, ""A Review
of the Opinion of "" the Supreme Court in the
Ciierokee caso.""
In that article 1 obberve, that the clauae of the
Constitution authorizing Congress ""to dispose ol'
and make all needful rules and regulations re­
specting the Territory or other property of the
United States, refers to Territorial rights, and
grants no jurisdiction over persons."" Among
other things I ?a^: 4,The power to dispose of,
and make needtul rules and regulations respect­
ing, the Territory and other properly of the
United States, and the power to exercise general
jurisdiction over persons upon it, are essentially
different and independent. The former is gene­
ral, and is given in the clause referred to; the
latter is special and is found in another clause,
and is confined to the federal tract, (the District
of Columbia,) and to places purchased by consent
of the Legislature of the State in which the same
shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines,
arvenals,dockyards,and other needful buildings.""
This is the same doctrine subsequently advocated,
and more fully developed, in my Nicholson letter.
I repeat that this power of internal legislation
cannot be found in the Constitution, and vain
have been the efforts, by pressing into its service
a thousand and one expressions in that instru­
ment, to prove it to be there; a diversity of refer­
ence which, of itself, furnishes a strong presump­
tion against the authority, even if there were no
other grounds of objection.
Judge McLeun, of tlio Supreme Court of the
United States, in some considerations published
by him upon this subject, and to which I have
elsewhere referred, well remarked, that ""there
is no specific power in the Constitution which
authorizes the organization of Territorial govern­
ments."" He adds: ""If this power be implied
froin the specific power to regulate the disposi­
tion of the public lands, it mnst, under tho above
rule, be limited to means suitable to the end in
view. If Congress go beyond this, in tho organi­
zation of a Territorial government, they act with­
out limitation, and may establish a monarchy.
Admit that they may organize a government
which shall protect the lanus purchased, and pro­
vide for the administration of justice among tho
settlers, it does by no means foflow that they may
establish slavery."" Judge McLean here brings
the Constitution of the United States to the sup­
port of the good old revolutionary doctrine, that
the right to establish Colonies or Territories does
not carry with it the just power to interfere with
and regulato the domestic concerns of the people
who inhabit them. He pronounces slavery to be
one of these concerns, saying that ""it is a muni­
cipal relation of limited extent, and of an equally
limited origin. It is a domestic relation over
which the federal government can exercise no
control.
I have never known the time when the Demo­
cratic party was called upon by higher consider­
ations to adhere, faithfully and zealously, to their
organization and their principles, than they arc
at this day. Our confederation is passing through
the most severe trial that it has yet undergone.
Unceasing efforts are making to excite hostile and
sectional feelings, against which wo were pro­
phetically warned by the Father of his Country,
and if these are successful, tho days of tho Con­
stitution arc numbered. The continued assaults
upon the South, upon its chnractor, its constitu­
tional rights, and its institutions, and the sys­
tematic perseverance and the bitter spirit with
which these are pursued, while they warn the
Democratic party of the danger should also incite
it to united and vigorous action. They warn it,
too, that the time has come when all other differ­
ences which may have divided it should give way
to the duty of defending the Constitution, and
when that great party, coeval with tho govern­
ment, should be united as one man for the ac­
complishment of t'ue work to which it is now
called, and before it is too late. It is tho Ameri­
can party, for it has neither sectional prejudices
nor sectional preferences, and its care and its
efforts extend wherever tho Constitution of its
country extends, with equal regard to the rights
and interests of all. I believe the fate of this
great republic is now in its hands, and, so believ­
ing, I earnestly hope that its action will be firm,
prompt, and united, yiolding not ono hair's
breadth of its time honored principles, and resist­
ing to tho last the dangerous efforts with which
we arc menaced; and, if so, tho victory of tho
Constitution, 1 doubt not, will be achieved.
I am, Sir, respectfully,
Your obedient servant,

ly afraid of a crowd collecting in fiont of

But the end was near. My aunt being
of an investigating turn of mind, was de­
sirous of finding out whether the exer­
tion of talking so loud was not injurious
to ray wife. So, ""Doesn't talking soloud
strain your lungs f"" said she, in an un­
earthly hoot, for her voice was not mu­
sical as it was when she was young.
""It is an exertion,"" shrieked my wife.
""Then why do you do it ?"" was the an­
swering scream.
""Because because you can't hear if
I don't,'' squealed my wife.
"" Wltat ?"" said my aunt, fairly rival­
ing a railroad whistle this time.
I began to think it time lo evacuate
the premises ; and looking round and
seeing John gone, I stepped into the back
parlor, and there he lay, flat on his back,
with his feet in the air at a right angle
to his body, rolling from side to side,
with his fists poked into his ribs, having
a most agonized expression of counte­
nance, but not uttering a sound. I im-

mediately and unvoluntarily nssumed a
similar attitude, and I think that from
the relative position of our boots and
head, and our attempts to restrain our
laughter, apoplexy must have inevitably
ensued if a horrible groan, which John
gave vent in his endeavor to suppress bis
risibility, had not betrayed our hiding­
place., In rushed my aunt and my wife, who
by this time compreheded the joke, and
such a scolding as I then got I never got
before and hope never to get again.
I know not what the end would have
been if John in his endeavors to appear
respectful and sympathetic, had not giv­
en vent to such a diabolical noise, some­
thing between a groan and horse laugh,
that all gravity was upset, and we sream­
ed in concert.
I know it was very rang and all that
to tell such falsehoods, but I think that
Niss Opie herself would have laughed if
she had seen Aunt Maryjs expression of
countenance when she was informed that
her hearing was defective.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84028385/1855-09-19/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,ohi_ariel_ver02,"","","",true,ca,Western Reserve chronicle.,Hapgood & Adams,"Warren, Ohio","","",9996,6504,5528,24340,1,25636,33100,4,ohi_ariel_ver02/data/sn84028385/00237283703/1855091901/0160.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warren%2C_Ohio,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/ohi_ariel_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn84028385%2F00237283703%2F1855091901%2F0160.jp2/pct:38.992042,19.649547,21.563426,73.534743/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/ohi_ariel_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn84028385%2F00237283703%2F1855091901%2F0160.jp2/pct:38.992042,19.649547,21.563426,73.534743/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

the parallel of 3ti deg. 30 in in. of north latitude; the ter­
ritory lying between the parallel and the province of
Texas, and constituting what isv now the State of Arksu­
sas, being left by implication to slavery. This compromise
was accepted, and thus diplomacy obtained for the privi­
leged class immediate advantages which had been denied
to their clamor and pulsion. This compromise, however,
could have only the authority of a repealable act of Con­
gress. ero ftir as the prohibition of slavery north of 30 dcg.
.10 min. was concerned. Wise and great men contrived ex­
traordinary forms to bind the faith of the privileged class
to that perpetual inhibition. They gt?ve to the compromise
the nature and lorin of a contract, with mutual equivalents
between the privileged class and the unprivileged class,
which it would be dishonorable and perfidious oa the part
of the privileged class, at any time, on auy grounds or un­
der auy circumstances, to annul or revoke, or even to draw
in question. They proclaimed it to be a contract proper
I to be submitted to the people themselves frr their ratifica­
tion in the popular elections. !t Y.as so submitted to the
l?eople, and ho ratified by them. By virtue of this com­
promise Missouri came immediately into the Union os a
j slave State, and Arkansas followed soon afterward as a
slave State ; while, with the exception of Missouri, the
I compromise of 1787, by virtue of the same compromise,
I was extended across the Mississippi, along the parallel of
3G deg. 30 min. to the Rocky mountains. Thus, and with
such solemnities, was the strife of tho privileged clh .i of
slaveholders for aggrandizement of territory finally com­
posed and forever settled.
It is not my purpose to discuss the policy or the justice
j of that great sentiment. As in the case of the constitu­
[ tion, the responsibility for that great measure rests with a
generation that has passed away. We have to deal with it
only as a fact) and with tho state of allairs that was estab­
lished by it.
The occupation of the new region west of the Miss issip­
pi, which had thus been saved for freedom, was nrtftllly
postponed indefinitely, by dedicating i! tv? a homo for the
concentrated but perishing Indian tribes. It sounds in
favor of the human'ty of the unprivileged class, if not of
their prudence, that they neither remonstrated nor com­
plained Of that dedication.
The success of the privileged class, in securing to them­
selves immediate possession of Missouri and Arkansas in
exchange for the reversionary interests of the unprivileged
class in the remainder of the Louisiana purchase, stimu­
lated them to move for new national purchases of domain,
which might yield them further acquisitions. Spain was
unable to retain longer the e'aveholding provinces of Kast
Florida and West Florida which lay adjacent to the slave
States. They fell to tho United States by an easy purchase,
and the privileged class with due diligence procured their
organization as a State aud its admission into the Union.
The Bpell of territorial aggrandizement had fallen on the
United States of America, and simultaneously the spell ol
dissolution had fallen on the I'nited States of Mexico. The
privileged class on our side of the border entered Texas, es­

taDUsned slavery tliere in violation ot Mexican lavs, de­
tached that territory from Mexico, and organized it as an I
independent sovereign State. Ttxu, thus independent and
sovereign, sought annex.ition to the United States. In the |
vary hour when tho virtue sf a sufficient number of the uu- ]
privileged classes *m giving way to effect a constitutional
annexation of Texas, the President of the United Suites,
with a Senate not less subservient to the privileged class,
executed a coujt d'etat by which that State unlawfully, and i
in dcfiance of all precedent, came into the Union under a '
covenant stipulating that four new slave States might be
created out of its territory and admitted as slave States,
while, by a solemn mockery, an inconsiderable fragment
that lay north of .10 deg. 80 niin. waa ostentatiously dedi­
cated to freedom. There remained no other new territoty
within the United States, and so, by this straugc partition
of Texas, there was a third final settlement of the pi (-ten­
sions of the privileged class ; and it was acquiesced in by
the unprivileged class, who thought themselves secure in
the old Northwest Territory by the ordinance of 1307, and i
equally safe in Kansas and Nebraska by the Missouri Com- |
promise.
The public repose that followed the annexation of Texas
was of short duration. Mexico resented that offence. A
war ensued, and terminated in the transfer of the entire
northern portion of Mexico to the United States. The
Mexican municipal laws fotbade slavery everywhere, und
the new possessions were under that law. Not a whit the
less for that reason did the privileged class deman^either I
an equal partition or that the whole should be opened to j
their colonization with slaves. The House of Representa­
tive* resisted these pretensions, as it had resisted similar \
ones before; but the Senate seconded the privileged class
with its accustomed /.oil. So Congress was divided, and
failed to organize civil governments for the newly-acquired !
Mexican Territories, and they were left under martial law.
The question raised by the privileged class went down to
the electors. The people promptly filled the House of Rep­
resentatives with a majority sternly opposed to tho exten­
sion of slavery the breadth of a single square mile. They
increased the force of the unprivileged cluss in tho Senate,
while they called to the presidency General Taylor, who,
although himself a slaveholder, was committed to non­
intervention on the question in Congress, and to exe­
cute faithfully whatever constitutional laws Congress
should adopt. Under these circumstances California and !
New Mexico, youthful communities, practically free from
slavery and uncorrupted by the seductions of the privi­
leged class of its political organs, hastened to establish
constitutions and apply for admission as free States, while
the eccentric population of Deseret, indulging hititudina­
rian principles equally in matters of religion and of politics,
prayed to be received into the Union as a State or as a Terri­
tory, and with or without slavery, as Congress should pre­
scribe. The privileged class remonstrated, and a seditious
movement was organized in their behalf in the slavehold­
ing States to overawe Congress, if possible, and to inaugu­
rate revolution if their menaces failed. You all know well
the way of that memorable controversy; how eminent
men yielded to the menaces without waiting for the revo­
lulion, and projected and tendered to the privileged class
a new Compromise, modelled after the already time-honored :
Compromise of 1320. You all know how firmly, notwith- !
standing this defection of leaders honored and lieloved, the ;
House of Representatives, and oven tho Senate, repelled the
Compromise, and how firmly tho unprivileged class of free­
men throughout the Union demanded the unqualified and
! unconditional admission of California into the Unloo. and '
I refused to allot any further Territories to the privileged
I class for the extension of the system of human bondage.
I You all remember, too, how in a critical hour the Pr< si­
dent sickened and died, ami how the hearts of Congress
and of all the people sorrowed at his grave, and tin-ncefor*
ward all was lost. You remember how the provisional
successor of that lamented President, with ominous haste,
accepted tho resignation of his cabinet and committed the
seals to a new one pledged like himself to the adoption of
I the Compromise, which tho people had condemned, and
i ' how at last, after a painful struggle, its adoption w as effect- I
? I ed. I think, also, that you have not thus soon forgotten !
II the terms of that Compromise, the fourth final and ever- ;
? lasting settlement of the conflict between the privileged
I and the unprivileged classes of this republic. You have not I
j forgotten how the ordinance of 1787, which excluded slavery
from the region northwest of the Ohio, was left to standi
I as an institution too sacred to be even questioned; how
| the Missouri Compromise, which extended that Ordinance
! across the Mississippi, and over nil Kansas and Nebraska, !
| was made at once the authority, precedent, and.formnla of |
| the new Compromise, and even declared to be an iriejtealable
law,forever, how California, which refused to becomes slave
State, was grudgingly admitted into the I nion as a free
one; how the hateful and detestable slave auctions were
banished from under the eaves of the Capitol quite across
to the opposite bank of the Potomac river; and how, in
consideration of these magnanimous and vast concessions
made by the privileged class, it was stipulated that slavery
i should tie continued in the District of Columbia as long as
the privileged class should require its continuance. New
i Mexico, with her free constitution, was superciliously re­
manded to her native mountains, while, without a hearing,
her ancient and free territory was dismembered, and its
fairest part transferred to Texas, with the addition of ten
millions of dollars, to win its acceptance by that defiant
privileged State. You rememlter how it w?- solemnly
Stipulated that Utah and New Mexioo, if the slaveholders

could corrupt them, should come into the Union in due
time ?n slaveholtlintr States; and, finally, how the privi­
leged d u?.-, bo highly otfended and exasperated, were
brought to accept this compromise on iheir part by u re­
mai tuient of the then obsolete fugitive-slave law ot 1193,
with the addition of the revolting feature! of an attempted
ffiinrmiiiiin of the Aabtut corfmt, mi absolute prohibition of
the trial by jury, an effective repeal of \ it. 1 rules of proce­
dure aad evident e, and the substitution of commissioners
in place ofeouru of justice, in derogation ot the concilia­
tion. You all remember how laboriously mid osteutatious­
ly thin compromise was asso iated with the time-honored
forms and solemnities of the Missottri Compromise ; bow it
wu declared not the r< -ult of mete ordinary legislation.
I but a contract, with mutual equivalents, by ihe privileged
wiili the unprivileged cla.-.M-s, Irrepe.Uabie utnl even unt?­
mendable without perfidy, and even treason against th*
constitution and the Union. You nil remember bow, not­
withstanding your pr v ts and mine, it was urgently, vio­
lently, clamorously ratified and confirmed, an a full, feir,
and final and perpetual adjustment by the two great polit­
ical conventions of the country, representing the whole
people of the I'uited States, and at Baltimore in 1852; and
how the heroic aud generous Scott wan relet'ted to bring
into the presidency one who might more safely be trusted
to delend and preserve and Htsbliib it forever.
Nevertheless, scarcely one ) ear had elapsed before the
privileged class, using s uae of our own representatives a*
I their instruments, broke up not only this Compromise of
1850, but even the Compromise of 18-0 and the ordinam c
of 1787, and obtained the declaration of Congress th.it all
these settlements, so far as they were adveivn to the privi­
leged class, were unconstitutional usurpations of legisla­
tive power.
I do not stop to oflgmatiat or even to charact'Ti/.e these
Regressions. Of what ti. "" would it be to charge perfidy.
when the lories we deplore have resulted from our own
imbecility and cowardice? i do not dwell, as others so
often and so justly do, uport the atrocious usurpation of
the government of Kant u by the slaveholders of Missouri,
nor t ven on the barbarous aud tyrannical code which
thev have established to stifle freedom in |ha( Territory,
nor even yet on the fraudulent and nefarious connivance ot
the President with the usurpers. Nor v, ill I draw into this
picture, already too darkly shaded, the personal humilia­
tions which daily come heme to yourselves in the conduct
cf your own it Rhus. Vou are commanded by au uncon­
stitutioual law of Coup reus to eelase and deliver up to the
member""! df t'ant privileged class their fugitive tlavee,
under pain of imprisonment mid forfeiture of your es­
tate*. Vou may not interpose between the armed slavi
holder anil the wounded slave to prevent his being
murdered, without coming under arrest for treipo'i, nor
may you cover bis naked nod btceiated limbs except
by stealth. You have (ought twenty years, und with
but partial success, for the constitutional right to lay
your remonstrances on the table of Congress. ""1 ou may
not tell the freed slave who reaches your borders that ho is
free without being seized by a federal court and condemned,
without a trial or even an accusation, to an imprisonment
without buil or mainprixe, and without limitation of sen­
tence. Your representatives 'u either house of Congress
must speak with bated breath and humbled countenance In
presence of the representatives of the privileged class, lest
justice f>e denied to your old soldiers when they claim their
pensions, or to your laborers w hen they claim the perform­
ance of their contracts with the government. The Presi­
dent of the United States is reduced to the position of a
deputy of the privileged class, emptying the trcflsury and
marshalling battalions, and ships-of-war to dragoon you
into the execution of the fugitivc-slavy law on the one
hand, while he removes governors and Judges at their com­
mand who attempt to maintain lawful and constitutional
resistance against them in the Territory of Kansas. The
Vice President of the United States and the Speaker of the
House of Representatives ?rc sate men whom the privi­
leged class can trust in every case. The care of the judi­
ciary of the Territories and even of the foreign relations i
intrusted in either house to assured supporters of thatclass.
Protection is denied to your wool, while it is freely given
to the slaveholder's sugar. Millions of ncrcs of the public
domain are freely given to Alabama for railroads and even
us gratuities, while not a dollar can be oh tallied to remove
tin! rocks of Hell Gate and the sands of the Overslaugh, or
the bare in Lake St. (.'lair, or in the mouths of your lake
harbors. Canada, lying all along your northern borders,
must not even be looked upon, lest you may lustafterit, while
millions upon millions are lavished in War and diplomacy to
annex and spread slavery over Louisiana, riotida, Texas,
Mexico, Cuba, aud Central America. Your liberty ol
speech, where is it ? Vou may not, without severe rebuke,
sjieak of despotism in foreign lands, lest the slave overhear
y on on the plantations of the privileged class, or the
foreign despot visit them, in retaliation, for your unavail­
ing sympathy. The national flag, the emblem of universal
liberty, covers cargoes of slaves not only in your own
view, but flaunts defiance over tliem in foreign ports.

judges ot tne i iiiiuil Mates court-', suit, under tlx;- protec­
tion of tin; President and tut- Senile, charge grand juries,
in advance of any question, thai obnoxious and unequal
federal Iuhs are constitutional and obligatory ; they give
counsel to legislative bodies bow to frame Uws which
they will ntuia, instead of waiting to review tt??ee laws
when enacted. 1 hey even convert the writ of freedom to
an engine of slavery, and tin y pervert the power of pun­
ishing irregularities committed in their presence into the
machinery of a tyranny us odious aa that of the star-cham­
ber. The privileged class in Virginia imprison your se**
men in their port* in retaliation for the independence of
your executive authorities; and you arc already in a
doubtful struggle for the right to exclude the truffle in
slaves from your own borders.
J will only ask, in concluding this humiliating rehearsal,
whether there i nor in this privileged country a privileged
class; whither it docs not stand on an enduring founda­
tion; whether it is not growing stronger and stronger,
while' tlio unprivileged clusa grows weaker and weaker;
whether its further growth and extent would not l>e hot
merely detrimental but dangerous; and whether there is
any hope to arrest thnt growth and extension hereafter if
the attempt shall not lie made now ^
The change that has become at last so necessary is ns,
eafty to he made m it is necessary. The whole uumber of
slaveholders is only three hundred and fifty thousand, one­
hundredth part of the entire population of the country.
If you add their parents, children, immediate relatives and
dependents, they are two millions?one-fifteenth part ol
the American people. Slavery Is not, and never can be,
perpetual. It will be overthrown either peacefully and
lawfully under thij constitution, or it will work tbe sub­
version of the constitution, together with its own over­
throw. Then the slaveholders would perish in the strug­
gle. Tbe change can now be made without violence and
by the agency of the ballot-box. Tbo temper of the na­
tion is just, liberal, forbearing. It will contribute any
money and endure any sacrifices to effect this great and
important change; indeed, it is half made already. The
House of Representatives is already yours, as it always
must be when you choose to have it. The Senate of the
United States is equally within your power, if you only
will persistently endeavor, for two years, to have it. Not­
withstanding all the wrong that bun liecn done, not another
slave State can now come into the I'uion. Make only one
year's constant, decisive effort, and you can determine what
States shall be admitted.
The will exists because the evil has become intolerable,
and the necessity of a remedy is universally acknowledged.
What, then, is wanted? Organization I Organization!
Nothing but organization.
Shall wo organize? Why not? Can we maintain the
revolution so auspiciously begun without organization?
Certainly not. Are you apprehensive of failure, because
tbe revolution is not. everywhere and at all times equally
successful ? Was there ever a revolution that was equally
successful at nil times and everywhere? Certainly not.
Do you say that you cannot abolish slavery in the privi­
leged Stales? V, e have no need, no purpose, no constitu­
tional power, no duty to do so. Providence has devolved
that duty on others, an l the organic law leaves it wisely
to them. We have power to avert the extension of slavery
in the Territories of the Union, and that is enough. Do
you doulit that power? Did not the sv legmen of 17s?
know the bounds of constitutional power ? Somebody has
municipal power in the unorganized Territories in tin
Union. Who is it? Hie not any foreign State; it is not
any ol the American States ; it is not tbe people in tin Ter­
ritories. It is the Congress of the whole United States, and
their power there is supreme. Are jou afraid that the
privileged class will not submit? Tbe privileged chws are
human, nnd they are wise. They know just ns well how
to submit to just authority, firmly and constitution­
ally exercised, as they do bow to extort unequal con­
cessions by terror from timid men. Can the priv­
ileged class live without a union any better than yon can ?
They would not remain and wrangle with you an hour
if tlicy could do so. Can they ever hope to obtain another
I'nion so favorable to them as this one, if this should be
overthrown? Will tliev destroy tbemc""lv< that they ma;,
simply do harm to you ? Did ever any privileged cl.is-""
eoinmit such an absurd suicide aa this? Are you alone
the keepers of the I'nion? Have not the privileged class
interests as great to maintain in the I'nion ? and are their
obligations to maintain it different from your own?
J low shall we Offanize? The evil i a natural one.
The power and tlM( influence and the organisation at tbe
privileged class pervade all parts of thl I'uion. It knows
no North, no South, no Kast, no West. It is stronger to­
day on the I.ay of Sail Francisco, surrounded by freemen,
than it is on Lhcsapaoki bay, surrounded by slaves. It Is
not a sectional but a national contest on which we have
entered. Our organization, therefore, must lie a national
one. The means of Succees are national. We must restore
the d< moralized virtue of the nation. We must restore the
principle of equality among the memliers of the State?
tbe principle of the sacredness of the absolute and inherent
right* of man. We wnnt, then, an organization Open to
all classes of men and that excludes none.
We want a liold, outspoken, fit^e-spoken organization?
one that openly proclaims its principles, its purposes, and
its objects ?iu tear of God and not of man?like that ininy
Which Cromwell led, that established the Ooinmonweulth
of England. This is the organi/.ation we want.
11 is best to take an existing organization that answers

to these conditions if we tan find one; if we cannot find
i.ue such, we mutt create one. Lei us try < xisting parties

| The principles of true democrats and the principles of
true '.s bigs remain throughout all changes of parlies and of
men, and, so far as they are sound, they are necessarily the
same, Such true democrats and true wbigs are now ready
tn unite on those Bound principles co'.uuiou to both.
Neither of these i wo classes can or ought to insist on forcing
a defective organization, with attained tanner, upon the
other. The republican organization liaa sagaciously seen
this, and magnanimously laid a new, sound, and liberal
pUUonu,broad enough for both classes to stand upon. Its
print iples are equal and exact justice ; its spcech open, de­
cided, Mid frank. Ita banner is untorn in former battles
and unsullied by past errors. That is the party for us. I
lio not know that it will always, or eveii long, preserve its
1 courage, its moderation, and ils consistency, If it shall do
j so it will re cue and save the country. If it, too, shall be­
! come unfaithful, as all preceding parties have done, it will,
without sorrow or regret on tnv part, perish as they are
perishing, and will give place to another, truer and better
Oil'4.
So lonir as the republican party shall be firm and faith­
ful to the constitution, the Union, and the rights of man, I
shall serve it, with the reservation of that personal inde­
pendence which is my birthright, but at the same time
with the zeal and devotion that patriotism allows and en­
joins. I do not know, and, personally, 1 do not greatly
care, that it shall work out its great ends this yenr or the
next, or iu my lifetime ; b< canst I know that those ends are
ultimately sure, and that lime and trial are the elements
which make all great reformations sure and lasting. 1
have not thus far lived for personal ends or temporary
fame, and 1 shall not begin so late to live or labor for them.

1 I lime hoped ili.it I might leave my country somewhat j
j worthier of a lofty destiuy, and the rights of human nature
| somewhat safer. A reasonable ambition mud always be
satisfied with sincere and practical endeavors. If, among
those who shall come after its, there shall he any curious
inquirer who shall full upon a name so obscure as mine,
he shall be obliged to confttn that however unsuccessfully
I labored for generous ends, y et that I nevertheless was
ever faithful, ever hopeful.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82003410/1855-10-23/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,dlc_chimera_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The daily union.,Thomas Ritchie & John P.

THE HVK.YKR OP APT AIR.
Mr. Shdell, (dem.) of La., called the attention of the
Senate to the telegrephlc despatch giving Mr. Sumner's
statement berore the Committee of the House, published
hie morning. Mr. Slidell said the statement declares.
Other persons were about me, offering me friendly as­
sistance, but I did not recognise any of them. Others
were at.a distance, looking on and offering no assistanoe,
of whom I reccgrtzed only Mr. Donglag, of Illinois, and, t
the light, my assailant standing between them. I wan
helped from the Borr, and eondus'.ed into the lobby of
the Senate, where I was placed upon a sofa. Of those
who helped me to the place I have no recollection. As 1
entered the lobby I recognized Mr. Blldell, of Louisiana,
who repeated; but I recognized no one else until some
time later, as i supposed, when I felt e friendly graep of
the band, which seemed to oome from Mr. Campbell, of
Ohio.
Mr. Slidell said It seemed to him proper to espials
bis own pr sit ion relative to this matter, as the published
statement mght canse a false impression on the public
mind. When the Senate adjourned that day he entered
an ante-room, where be remained in eonversatioa with
Messrs Douglas, Fitzpatrlok and J. Glancey Jones, and
while there was informed that Mr. Sumner had been
badly beaten by Mr. Brooks. He came into the Senate
chamber, but there were to many persona crowded around
Mr. Sumner that he did not tee htm at all, and he Boon
returned to the ante-room to finish his conversation­
Having remained there for some time, he was passing
through the reception room to go home when he met Mr.
Sumner in the door, leaning on two persons whom he did1
not know. Hie face was esvered with blood, and as ho
(Slidell) was not on such terms as to make it tesassary to
express any sympathy?not having spoken to Mr. Somner
for two years?he turned aside, and went out by another
door. He had not the slightest idea before the occurrence
took place that Mr. Brooks, or anybody else, had any inten­
tion of attacklrg Sumner, and was entirely free from any
participation or counsel in the matter.
Mr. Dovglas, (dem.) of 111., corroborated the state­
ment of Mr. Slidell, and said that when be (Douglas),
heard that Mr. Sumner had been attacked, his first idea
w&b to come in and endeavor to restore quiet; but, upon
reflecting that his motives in interfering might be mis­
construed, he did not enter the Senate chamber until the
effray was ever. The crowd around Sumner was then
so large that for some time he eould not see him.
He saw Messrs. Toombs, Crittenden, Pearoa
and Evans, all seated in or near their nauaf
seats; but be was not near Brooks, as stated in the re­
port. This was a total misapprehension on the part of
Mr. Sumner. Mr. Douglas added that he had no know­
ledge or suspicion that any assault was contemplated,
or would be made, here or elsewhere. He did not ap­
proach Mr. Brooks nor speak to him, and was not within
fifty feet of the Senator from,Georgia (Mr. Toombs). How
such an idea couid have got into Mr. Sumner's bead it
was impot sible for him to conceive. The published state­
ment might carry an impression to the country that he
was aiQirg and abetting, and wus, in fact, a participant
in the asiault; but that was an entirely erroneous idea,
as he did not even know that Mr. Sumner was in the
Capitol at the time the assault was committed.
Mr. Togmus (national), ofGa., remarked that he waa
in his seat at the time, and how Mr. Sumner eould sup­
pose he caw him near Mr. Brooke be could not telL It
might be that in the confudon Mr. Sumner mistook
General Gorman for him. Mr. Toombs further said that
in erpresticg opinions about tbe affair at the time, some
gentlemen condemned it, but he (Ioomhs) told Mr.
Brooks that he approved of it.
Mr. Butllr (dem.,) of S. C., said he had juit arrived in
tbe city, but had he been in Waihington he should have
sBBumedall the responsibility taken by bis gallant rela­
tive. Be denied, in the most emphatic manner, ths state­
ment of Mr. Sumner, that what he had said 1st bis speech
was strictly in response to what Butler had said on for­
mer occ&ticna. He understood that the Legislature ot
Mam chu setts had passed resolutions in reference to tbe
rffrsy. and when these resolutions should be>presented

to U? Senate te should apeak on the subject M it de­
itrved. Not a tingle one of Mr. Sumner's rem&sfca (a
relation to him was a response to anything whieb be
(Sutler) bad said npen tbe Kansas question. Hie friends
in South Carolina and eame or bin friend* here thought
he (Butler) had been remarkably moderate in
the character of hie remark*. He had scrupulously
avoided taping anything to violate the courtesies
of Senatorial debate, and spoke neither of the
beiator frcm Massachusetts, to blm or about him.
Mr. WVue, (nigger worshipper) of Ohio, said it was
impcFslb.e for him to sit etill and hear such principles
avowed as be bad beard on thi* ocoaslon. As to the
facte In reierence to the assault he knew nothirg about
tbern, aid had nothing to sty on that point. He was
here in a pretty lean majority, not more titan about one*
fifth of the Senate entertaining opinion* similar to hie;
but when he heard It stated that on this floor an aesaa­
sin-like, cowardly attack bad been made upon a man
unarmed, and having no power to defend himtelf, and
that be bad been strieksn down and almoet murdered,
and then heard a Senator avow that he ap­
proved such conduct, it became a matter of some
interest and Importance to all the members
of thi* body, and especially to the minority. A
brave man etuld not defend himself against such an at­
tack as tbif, and might be overpowered by comber*;
' but, overpowered or not, live or die,"" said be, '-1 will
vindicate tbe right* of liberty ef debate and tbe freedom
of discussion so long as I live. If the principle an­
nounced here is to prevail, let ne come armed for the
combat. Although you are four to one, I am hare to
meet you. A man oan die in no better cause than its
vindication of the rights of debate on this floor. If
these are the principles that are to be approved by a
majority, and become part and paroel of the law of Con­
gress. let it be understood.""
Mr. Wnsox, (nigger worshipper) Of Mass., thought
the explanation of Mr. Slidell was not inconsistent with
anything stated by his oolleague. He had no id*a that
Mr. Banner intended to place Mr. Slidell in a false
position. The Senator from Illinois has, he said, also
made his explanation, and I see nothing la that Incon­
sistent with the statement of Mr. Sumner. He was
stricken down upon this floor by a brutal, murderous
and cowardly assault.
Mr. Brn.** (in bis seat)?You are a liar.
Mr. Sttart, (dem.) of Micb., called tbe Senator to
order, and stated also that there wee no question btfore
tbe Senate. It was evident the debate wis becoming ac­
crimonious, end he hoped it might be postponed until
tbe matter conld be considered with more calmness.
Mr. Bt tier apologise iter words which fell from him Ife
a moment of excitement, and said that in discussing the
resolutions tf tbe Massachusetts Legislature, if be should
transgrses the bound* of propriety, it would be because
be wa* provoked to it. He had never been the agpreseor,
and he celled upon the Senate to bear witness to the
feet.
Mr. Wuso.v resumed. His colleague had stated the
feets to tbe best of hie recollection, and it wm not to be
expected that after inch severe blow*, which had ren­
dered him nnconscton*, he could be perfectly accurate ia
every minute particular. He did not believe he had iaf
tended to do io justice to anybody, and when he was again
able to take ble seat he would be ready to meet the
Senator from South Carolina and others In debate; mean­
time, any assumption of superiority by the Senator might

On the 23th of Jfay t planted äböüt half nn
acre of ground, one year old,, a portion of the
soil was low and wet in the spring, in fact I
covered the seed with mud, the other part was
high and sandy, the consequence was when
the dry season set in, the wet part baked very
hard and the high burnt up for the want of
rain, I plowed it when about ten inches high
and that was all the working it got, with the
exception of a slight hoeing previous to plow
ing; my object was to ascertain the amount of
saccharine matter contained in the stocks, and
supposed enough would grow to make the ex­
periment many of the stalks grew from 16 to
120 feet high, (in the low ground it only grew
12 feet ) Having made a mill on which to
grind it, I commenced on the 24th of Septem­
bers the cane had then received two or three
IVosts which slightly injured the taste of the
water. I am convinced that the amount of
stalks I used can bo grown on less than a
quarter of an acre, the amount of water ob­
tained from the- piece was 270 gallons, from
which I made 45 gallons of molasses which in
flavor and beautiful bright red color, is far su­
perior to any molass.es. obtained in the South.
I did not try to grain any of, it, as it will not
grain after being frosted; but I am convinced
there will be no difficulty in graing it if tried
previous to frost. If it U planted by the mid­
dle of May it will ripen by the end of August,
and remain in good condition until frost, and
if cut up and put in sheds (in apprehension of
frost; it will keep Well, Tor a month or more.

proaching bis domioioos, and waving at his very frontiers.
Hastily ba packed ap hia jewels and valuable*, together
with Between two and three million* of thalers, and took
tko wap la tba a an! sat Oily of Frank fort, hoping there to
find miens of placing hia wealth and the Jewels ol his
haaaa la aacarity.
Arrived at Iks city which had for benlurte* sent forth
the rulers of the “holy Roman Empire,” the logitiee Land­
grooo knocked at the door of an humble Jewish banker,
lleyer Rothschild, richer in children thsj thaler*, but
wishai a distinguished aad experienced archeologist aad
numlaMloiogisL
Tba sovereign, who himself was an expert in these sci­
ences, paid mooh respect to tbe knowledge of tbe Jew
banker, aad bad actually a tow years before bestowed up­
on Aim Mm distinction of the title of “MedaiUeur to bis

“Moyer,” bo began, aa ha banded him hie well filled
case, “1 know yon to be honest end coracienliotis. Here
fa all I possess; take it, and return it to me when (his
tempest shall have blown over, and when better times
dawn apoo aa.”
“Swell vast confidence does me greet honor,” replied
tho Hebrew, “bat your Highness must not forget that the
republican army is almost before our doors.”
“We are la the hands of Providence,"" replied Ike Land­
grave. “I ask yon for no receipt.”
Tbe PH nos re-entered hi* vehicle and harried off, with­
out listening to the renewed protestations of the man of
What Meyer RotbachUd had anticipated, duly came to
paaa. Before a week was over, Frankford wos in the pos­
session of the French troops, and the backer who had
bean denounced aa an anti-revolutionist, and an ally of tbe
tvrenfa, found bin domicile sacked, and Ills cash box plun­
dered in tbe name of liberty and the people.
Ho sooner, however, had the victors left Frankfort, than
Meyer Rothschild re-opened bis baokiug house, finding at
first credit among the Jews, and nltimateiy with rll the
business world, and soon was reputed richer thin ever.—
In lfiOfi be was once more considered as ons ul tbe must
reliable bankers in Germany.
About this time there came a short period of rest for the
crowned heads of Germany. The Princes of the Rhenish
Confederacy reeled under the high and forced protection
ol Napoleon. Raised by the will of tbe great commander to
the dignity of an Elector of the German Empire, the Land­
grave ol Hesse received permission to return to his dotui­
nfowe. On his way he passed through Frankfort. Ths
journals had before informed him of the plundering ol
Rothschild's house, and bo naturally believed his own
wealth loag since a prey to tho Jacobins. Still he deler­
mlned to visit hie numismatic friend, if only to assure him
of tba continuance of bis confidence.
""Good morrow, Meyer,” said (be Elector, with a frank
and hearty shake of hands. “At last we have peace, old
friend, but it costs us dear enough.” Before you stands a
ruined man ; as poor as Job.
""What! you poor, your Highness*”
""Certainly, for have not those confounded sans culot­
tes stolen my wealth aloug with yoors 7 If I do not now
too much inconvenience you, 1 should like to Ixirrow a
small advance upon the indemnity which I shall receive in

“Wh*t!"" exclaimed the I’rince, “and were you not
plundered, then T""
“The French have taken everything I had, and I wa*
very careful not to excite them by resistance; otherwise
they would have searched more thoroughly and might have
lonnd your diamood* and mouey where it was hidden in
my cellar.""
“flow! it it possible?”
“Yes my surrender wa* a stratagem. They never found
what I had hidden. For the last nine years, in order to
indemnity myself lor the moneys I had lost, I have taken
the liberty of using some of yours. All my enterprises
hsve proved successful, and without embarrassing myself,
in the least, I can now return you the entire sum with Cve
per cent, interest.’’
Tbe Prince was deeply moved.
11 Meyer,” be said, “You arc the most honorable Jew 1
have ever beard of. Keep my money, and continne to op­
erate with It. From to day for two Tears, I want no return
of it, and only two per cent, interest.""
And thus Rothschild became a millionaire.

I would rather, when 1 am laid iu the grave,
that some one iu big manhood should stand
over me, and say: “There lies one who was a
real Iriond to me, and privately warned ine
of the dangers of the young. No one knew
it, but he aided uie iu time of need. 1 owe
what I am to him.” Or would rather have
some widow, with choking utterance, telling
bar children, “There is your friend and
mine, lie visited me in my affliction, and
touud you, my sou, an employer, and you,
my daughter, a happy home in a virtuous
family.” 1 would rather that such persona
should stand at my grave, than to have erected
over it the most beautiful sculptured monu­

heart’s broken utterance of reflections of
past kindness, and the tears of gratelul mem­

A Home Withoi't a Daiuhter?Boy* may
not lack affection, but they may lack tender­
nesg They may not be wanting in inclination
to contribute their quota to the Paradise of
Home, but they may be wanting in the ability
to carry out their inclination. The son of a
household is like a young and vigorous sapling
? the daughter is like a fragile vine.
We know a hoine which once rejoiced in the
fiunnv smiles and the musical accents of an only
daughter. She was a lovely child?womanly
beyond her years :
"" Full of gentleness, of calmest hope,
of sweet and quiet joy
The child never breathed who cvinccd a more
affectionate reverence, or a more reverential
affection for her parents than did she. Instead
of waiting for their commands, she anticipated
them?instead of lingering until they made
known their wishes, she studied their wishes
out. Morning broke not in that household until
she awoko?the night was not dark until her
eyes were closed. How they loved her! did
her father and her mother; and of how many
blessed pictures of the future wap she tho sub­
ject. "" It is a fearful thing that Love and
Death dwell in the same world,"" says Mrs.
Hemans. ""Fearful! ' It is maddening?it is
a truth that is linked with despair.
Suddenly, like a thief in the night, there
came a messenger from Heaven for the child?
saying that the Lord had need of her. She
meekly bowed her head?breathed out her little
life? and, at midnight 4> went forth to meet the
Bridegroom. The last minute of the last hour
of the last day ot the month was hallowed by
her death. She went and came back no more !
\ears have worn away since then, but still
there is agony in the household whose sun went
down when she departed. The family c>rc'e is
incomplete?there is no daughter there ! The
form that once was here rcj?oses among the con­
genial charms of nature and art; they have
mado the place of her rest beautiful. If the
grass grows rank upon her grave, it is bccause
It is kept wet with tcais.
Ot a truth. A h^me without a girl in it is
only halt blest; it is an orchard without blos­

ot sons is like Lebanon with its cedars, but

ing participants in these meetings are hun­
gerers slier notoriety—nothing more. If these
hungerers were really hungry, they would be
hunting for something to do, instead ol
shooting about the sreets and public squares.
A gentleman in New York offered work to
one thousand men at one dollar a day, but
ihe poor starvelings refused to take less than
a dollar and a quarter! If hunger and cold
should pinch them shortly, whuse fault will
it be *

There are many sufferers in the large cit­
ies, we have no doubt, but they are not to
be found among the blathering throngs that
assemble in public parks and upset bread
carts in the gutter, wantonly destroying what
they pretend to be starving for want of—Val­
ley Spirit.

THE Easton (Pa.) Arga) mentions an inci­
dent of an old gentleman, recently deceased,
in Lehigh county, who had been suspected
of having considetable money in his house,
although no one knew the amount. On ex­
amining his premises, after his death, no
less than eleven thousand dollars were found
in specie, which he had doubtless been sav­
ing and concealing for many years.

AN editor out West, advises private debt­
ors to gel themselvesinoorporated into Banks
as soon as possible, because when a man
fails, his property is seized, and if he at­
tempts to evade payments, he is called a
""swindler,"" but when Banks fail they are
unfortunate, and ihe Legislature makes it all
right. Pretty true.

I'PROCLAMATION BY THE GOVERNOR.

""CITIZENS OF UTAH—We are invaded by a
hostile force, who are evidently assailing us
to accomplish our overthrow and destruction.
For the last twenty-five years, we have trust­
ed officials of the Government, from con­
stables and justices to judges, governors, and
presidents, only to be scorned, held ir. deri­
sion, insulted and betrayed. Our houses
have been plundered and then burned, our
fields laid waste, our principal men butcher­
eihwhile under the pledged faith of the Gov­
ernment for their safety, and our families
driven from their homes to find that shelter
in the'barren •wilderness, and that protection
among tbo hostile savages, which were de­
nied them in the boasted abodes of Chrislt-,
auity and civilization.

""The Constitution of our common country
guaranties unto us all that we do now or have
ever cliimed. If the constitutional rights
whioh pertain nnto ns as American ci.izens
were extended to Utah according to the spirit
and meaning thereof, and fairly and impar­
tially administered,, it is all that we could
ask—all that we have ever askeu.

""Our opponents have availed themselves -
of prejudice existing against us, because of
our religious (aith, to aeDd out a formidable

have had no privilege nor opportunity ol de­
fending ourselves Irani the false, foul, and ;
unjust aspersions against us before the nation-
Tie Government has hoi condescended to 1
cause an investigating committee or other
persons to be sent to inquire into and ascer­
tain the truth, as is customary in such cases.
We know those aspersions to he false : but
that avails us nothing. We are condemned
unheard, and forced to an issue with an
armed mercenary mob, which has been sent
against us at the instigation ol anonymous
letter-writers, ashamed to lather the base,
slanderous falsehoods which they have giv­
en to the public—of corrupt officials, who
have brought false accusations against us to
screen themselves in their own infamy, and
of hireling priests and howling edi ore, who
prostitute the truth for filthy lucre's sake.
""The issue which has thus been forced
upon us compels us to resort to the great first
law of self preservation, and stand it: our own
defence—a right guarantied unto u* by the
genius ol the institutions of our country, and
upon which the Government is based. Our
duly to ourselves, to our families, requires
us not to lamely submit to be driven and slain
without an -al'empi to preserve ourselves.
Our doty to our country, our holy religion,
our Gnd, to freedom and liberty, requires that
we should not quietly stand still and see those
fetters forging around us which are calcula­
ted to enslave and bring us in subjection to
an unlawful military despoliem, such as can
only emanate, in a country of constitutional
law, from usurpation, tyranny, and oppres­
sion.

""SIR : I have the honor to acknowlege the
receipt of your communication of September
29, 1857, with two copies ol a proclamation
and one of the laws of Ulah, and have given
it an attentive consideration. I am at the
present the senior and commanding officer
of the troops of the United Slates at this point,
and f will submit your letter to the general
commanding as soon as he arrives here.

""In the meantime, I have only to say that
these troops are liore by the order of the Pre­
sident of the United States, and their further
movements andoperations will depend entire­
ly upon orders issued by competent military
authority.

""Very respectfully, E. B. ALEXANDER.""

Among the documents is a letter from Col.
Johnson, dated from the camp, on the thtoa
wings of the Sweet Water, addressed to Ad­
jutant General McDowell, New York, inr
which he confirms the burning of the con­
tractor's trains by the Mormons. He says
the Governor's escort is four days' march be­
hind him, two companies of dragoons. lis
knows no reason why Col. Alexander should
attempt to reach Salt Lake by Bear river, ex­
cepting from the fear that the Mormons have
burned the grass on the shorter route. He
adds: ""If 1 could communicato with Col.
Alexander I would direct him to take up a
good position for the winter at Ham's Fork.
Tho road is beset between thia and Ham's
Fork with companies of Mormons, so it is
doubtful whether 1 shall be able to communi­
cato with Col. Alexander.""

It is supposed at the War Department that
the troops are all in good condition, as noth­
ing to the contrary is said io the despatches.
On the receipt of the above despatches a
special mealing of the Cabinet was immedi­
ately called, but nothing has transpired with
reference to their deliberations.
Ventilation..lts Necessity-How Best Ef­
fected.
The approach of cold weather, when so
much of the time is spent within doors, re­
minds us that the disregard of ventilia­
tion causes more colds, consumptions and
disease generally, than anybody bat a phys­
ician would suppose.
, The process of breathing, it is well
known, vitiates the atmosphere of confined
apartments. A tight room, eight feet high,
and twelve by fourteen feet square, will
have its air poisoned in two hours by three
persons sitting in it. In a single hour, a
company of twelve persons, in a parlor six­
teen feet by twenty, and nine ieet high,
will render the atmosphere unhealthy, if
the doors are closed. Yet, in the face of
these scientific facts, there are thousands
of households in Philadelphia where, every
winter, it is the practice of the family to sit
in heated apartments without any provision
for ventilation.
Nature, even when doors and windows
are all closed, makes an effort to ventilate
rooms, by forcing fresh air through th®
cracks. But it will not do to trust to these
especially in sleeping chambers, where ven­
tilation is peculiarly necessary. The open­
ing of a window, both at top and at bottom,
is one of the best methods of ventilation ;
but in order to avoid draughts, it is necessa­
ry to discriminate between times when the
temperature out of doors is colder than
within, and when it is the reverse ; for the
in the first case, the cold air enters at the
j bottom of a window and passes out at the
top, while in the other it enters at the top
and passes out at the bottom. Ventilating
a room, by leaving a door ajar, is governed
jby the same rules. Sudden colds which
j cannot bo accounted for, often occur by
sleeping in draughts, which might have
been avoided by a litllo practical knowl­
edge.
It is ittdispensible, however, that the hu­
man system should be accustomed to cur­
rents ol air. To remain habitually in warm,
close rooms, carefully protected from
draughts, is almost certain to cause a cold
on going out into the air. If the person is
heated, the liability to take cold is very %
great on entering a current. But where the
whole body is exposed, there is less danger
than where only a portion is. A late writer
has estimated that any current of air moving
with a velocity of more than two feet per
second, is perilous. This, therefore, may
be considered a rule by which to de guided
in ventilating apartments. Where it is im­
possible to introduce fresh air, without a
violent current, a screen or other apparatus
should bo used, by which to distribute the
air more equally and avoid unhealthy
draughts. Bed-rooms which have no fire
place, should invariably have an opening
into the Hue; for many persons fear catch­
ing cold if they leave their windows down,
and such, if there is neither fire-place nor
opening into the flue, kill themselves by
slow poison.
No system of ventilating a room has ever
been devised equal to the old fashioned
open fire place. But the expense of this
method will prevent its returning into gen­
eral use. As open fire-places are the best
ventilators, so stoves are the worst; and
unfortunately, of all processes of heating,
the stove is the cheapest. Hot-air furnaces
combine, practically, economy and health,
better than any other method ; but few fur­
naces are constructed rightly, and fewer still
are managed properly. The hot-air should
be introduced pure, moist, and equally ;
and an opening or openings should be pro­
vided for it to escape; and yet not one hot­
air furnace in ten is worked in this way.
Where expense is no consideration, a com­
bination of an air-heating apparatus with
open fire-places, gives the nearest approach
wnich is possible, to perfect ventilation.—
There are hundreds of familios in Philad­
elphia able to afiord this combination, who
nevertheless disregard it, and many of them
in consequence, pay the doctor more than
they would","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85025182/1857-11-25/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,pst_hershey_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The star of the north.,R.W. Weaver and B.S.

to Kansas, admonish me, that, as Governor of that
Territory, it will no longer be in my power to pre
serve the peace or promote the public welfare.
At the earnest solicitation of the President, after
repeated refusals, the last being in writing, I finally
accepted this office, upon his lettter showing the danger*
and difficultiea of the Kanaas question, and the
Ti~c?-saity of ray undertaking the task of adjustment
Under these circumstances, notwithstanding the great
sacrifices to me, personal, political and pecuniary, 1
frit that I could no more refuse such a call from my
country, through her Chief Magistrate, than the sob
dier in battle who is ordered to command a forlorn
hope.
i accepted, however, on the express condition that
1 should advocate the submission of the Constitution
to the vote of the people for ratification or rejeotiou.
These views were clearly understood by the Preriderit
and all his Cabinet. They were distinctly set
f.'rth in iny letter of acceptance of this office of the
26rh of March la<-t, and reiterated in my Inaugnral
address of the '??7th of May last, as follows:
""Indeed 1 oanoot doubt that the Convention after
having framed a State Constitution, will submit it for
ratification or rejection by a majority of the then ac
tual bona fide resident settlers ot Kansas.
' Witb these views well known to the President and
Cabinet, and approved by them, I acoepted the appointment
of Governor of Kansas. My instructions
from the President, through the Secretary of State,
under date of the 30rh of March last, sustain 'the
regular Legislature of the Territory1 in 'asstemlhns
a_Convention to form a Constitution,' and they express
the opinion of the President, that 'when such a
Constitution shall be submitted to the people of thr
Territory, they must be protected in the exercise of
their right of voting roH or against that instrument;
and the fair erp ession of the popular tci/l
must not be interrupted by fraud or violence.*
""1 repeat, then, aa my clear oonvictioo, that unless '
the Convention submit the Constitution to the vote
of all the actual resident settlers of Kansas, and the
elec'ion be fairly and justly conducted, the Constitution
will be, and ought to be, rejected by Congress.""
This Inaugural most distinctly asserted that it was
not the question of slavery merely, (which I believed
to bo of little practioal importance then in its applica'ion
to Kansas,) but the entire Constitution which
ehou'd be submitted to the people for ratification or
rejection. These were my words ou that subjeot in
iny Inaugural: ""It is not merely, shall slavery exist
in or disappear from Kansas, but shall the great prin
cip'es of self government and State sovereignty be
maintained or subverted?"" In that Inaugnral I prtfcoed
further to say. that the people ""may, by a subs-quent
vote, defeat the ratification of the Constitu­

tion."" 1 designate this as a ""great constitutional
right,"" and add ""that the Convention 5s the servant
and not the master of the people.""
Iq my official dispatch to you of 2d June last, a
copy of that inaugural Address was transmitted to
you f?r the further information of the President and
his Cabinet. No ezoeption was ever takeu to any
portion of that address; on the oontrary. it is distinctly
admitted by the President in his message, with
ooinmendnble trankuess, that my instructions iu favor
of the submission ot the Constitution to the vote ol
th-people were ""general and unqualified."" By that
Inaugural and subsequent addresses. I was pledged to
the people ot Kaojae to oppose by all ""lawful means""
the adoption of any Constitution which was not fairly

Coiu*C8 Facts A»out the Pb«si»ent8.—
The following compilation of carions coinci­
dences in the names and lives of the first seven
Presidents of the United States (Washington,
John Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, John
Q. Adams, and Jackson) is furnished by the Bos­
ton Transcript:
“Four of the seven were from Virginia. Two
of the same name were from Massachusetts, and
the seventh from Tennessee. All but one were
sixty-six years old on leaving office, having
served two terms; and one of them who had
served but one term would have been sixty-six
years of age at the end of another. Three of the
seven died on the fourth of Jaly, and two of
them on the same day and year. Two of them
were on the sub-committee of three that
draughted the Declaration of Independence, and
these two died on the same day and year, and
on the anniversary of the Declaration of Inde­
pendence, and just half a century from the day
of declaration. The names of three of the seven
end in son, yet none ot these transmitted his
name to a son. In respect to the names of all,
it may be said, in conclusion, the initials of two
of the seven were the same; And the initials of
two others were the same. The remaining one
who stands alone in this particular, stands alone
also in the love and admiration of his country­
men and the civilized world—Washington I—
Of the first five only one had a son, and that son
was also a President.

A Delightful Legend .—There is a!
charming tradition connected with the ^
site on which the temple of Solomon was
erected. It is said to have been occu- bi
pied in common by two brothers, one of j
whom had a family; the other had none, j
On this spot was sown a field of wheat.! y<
On the evening succeeding the harvest, j
the wheat having been gathered in sep-,
arate shocks, the elder brother said unto j y,
his wife, "" My younger brother is unable !
to bear the burden and heat of the day; c<
J. will arise, take of my shocks and place J
with his, without his knowledge."" The n
younger brother, being actuated by the
same benevolent motives, said within y<
himself, ""My elder brother has afamily,
and I have none; 1 will contribute to
their support ; I will arise, take of my a
shocks and place them with his, without
his knowledge."" Judge of their mutual
astonishment when, on the following a
morning, they found their respective 0
shocks undiminished. This course of t ]
events transpired for several nights^
when each resolved in his own mind to ci
stand guard and solve the mystery.— =
They did so : when on the following p
night, tliey met each other half-way be­
tween their respective shocks, with their -
arms full. Upon ground hallowed with
such associations as this was the temple^ ^
of Solomon erected—so spacious and""
magnificent! tlio wonder and auunration J
of the world. Alas! in these days how a
many would sooner steal their brother s , [
whole shock, than add to it a single '
sheaf!","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86053686/1860-03-24/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,lu_arbok_ver04,"","","",true,ca,Pointe Coupee Democrat.,Edward J.

Ci-kk fob Caxcek. Mr. Thomas Andertoa gives
the followiag recipe for cancel, which, he says, has
beeu of service In several dangerous cases : Uotl
liuoTurkey figs in new milk, which they will thicken;
when they are tender, split and apply them as warm
as they can be borne to the part affected, whether
broken or not; the part must be washed every time
the poultice is changed with some of the milk ; use a
fresh poultice night and morning, and at least once
during the day, and drink a quarter of a pint of the
milk the figs are boiled in twice in the twenty-four
hours. If tbe stomach will bear it this must be per­
severed for three or four months at least. A man
aged 11)5 years was cured, about six years before his
de ith.with only six pounds of ffgs. The cancer, which
began at the corner of his mouth, had eaten through
his jaw, cheek and halfway down his throat : yet he
was so perfectly cured as never to show any tendency
to r dura. Should it ever do so. die figs should be
a-ain applied. Tho first application gives a great
deal oi pain, but afterwards each successive dressing
gives relief. A woman cured by this remedy had
been ofliicted for ten years ; her breasts bled exces­
sively ; ten pounds cured her,""

family by marriage. Being in Italy, at an even.

supper table by a young English nobleman, who
had a good share of the puppy in his composition.
at Thinking to quiz the lady, he said : ""You are ac­

well."" ""A monstrously vulgar people, are'ut
they ?"" ""Yes; but what could you expect when
t- you consider that they are descended from the

shopping. They are not equal to it.
Nature has left their faculties imperfect
in that particular. They can write books
and makd speeches, and all that sort of
thing, but they, are not up to shopping.
It takes the ladies for that. Men go to
a store and select what they want and
buy it. ' But that is not shopping that
requires no genius for that !
Mcu pretend they do not like to go
shopping with the ladies. I wonder who
ever asked them? What lady would
have such an incumberanec on such an
occasion? Men are well enough in their
places. Young gentlemen arc convenient
to take us to concerts, and bcc us home
from Church, and bring us boquets and
music; and husbands arc useful, I suppose,
to pay the bills, &c, but for a shopping
excursion they are quite out of place.
Don't understand mo to insinuate that
I have any distinguished ability that way.
Not at all I only speak for my sex. In
fact, I acknowledge that I am regarded
by my lady acquaintances as a poor hand
at it. But my friend SallicZ. is a model
shopper. I am taking lessons, of her,
and hope to be perfect by the time I am
married. A few days since she invited
me with her.
"" I wish to look at the new style silks,""
said she.
"" Why, do you want a dress?"" said I-
"" Really,"" said Sallie, "" if it was not
impolite, I should say you were verdant.
I don't want a dress but that's no rea­
son I should not see the material.""
So Sallic and I sallied out. The first
store we entered, she asked whether the
merchant had received his spring goods.
He said he had, and enquired what she
would like ro sec.
"" Show me your new style dresses,""
said she, "" such as borage robes, and lawn
robes ; handsome striped and plaid silks ;
brocades aud changeable silks arc not
much worn this spring, but I'll look at
your solid colors.""
The merchant soon had his counter
spread with goods. She examined aud
tossed the pieces about, making various
ugly creases in thcin, to seo whether they
would come out again by rubbing.
"" What style is most worn,"" . inquired
Sallic.
"" Well, we sell probably more ( plaids
and stripes than any other. ,
"" Have you any with the chene stripe?""
"" 0 yes, somo very fine,"" and a variety
of pieces were produced.
"" Well I can't say after all, that I like
the chene stripe ; they look like the old
style, reviewed ; I prefer the plaids ; the
green is very pretty.""
So Sallie held it in various lights, rub­
bing and creasing it. "" Well it don't
crease much,"" said she, I wonder whether
it willcut."" .
"" No, it is boiled silk ; and we find the
plaids and stripes usually wear well.'
""Your silks are quite pretty, and you
may cut me off samples,"" continued Sallic.
. This the merchant was forced to do,
though with rather a bad grace, as most
of his goods was in patterns, and he
feared spoiling the piece. .
; "" Will you be kind enough to give , me
samples of the solid colors?"" :
These were all furnished.
"" This plaid, you say, is $1 87. Is that
the lowest?"" ' '.
"" Yes wo can't take less.""
"" How many yards in the pattern ?"" ,
"" Fourteen."" . , ,'
"" I'd rather have eighteen ; perhaps . I
might conclude to have flounces. Well,
I'll take the, samples and show my moth­
cr, and then make up my mind. Have
you any .Coate's cotton ? ; Givo me a spool
No. 83, , i .i
This was handed her, and she paid five
cents, and we left. I looked at my watch.
We had been there exactly ono hour. t
"" What a cheat. I can buy these spools
for four cents,"" said Sallic, when fairly
out, ,. "" and, besides, wo , forgot their
shawls !"" ;, .;'""""V, V.
So wo went to another store, , .
' "" Have yon Stella shawls ? .
Yes some beautiful ones just opened.
Would you see the Brocho borders or the
printed?""

Both."" ' '.''''
"" Any particular colors ?""
"" No--I'll look at all of them,"" said
Sallic. ' . . :'. 7 ' '
' Different colors, qualities and patterns,
were accordingly ' produced.
""What is the price of this green cen­
ter, Brochc border ?"" inquired Sallic.
"" We can afford you that at nine dollars
same style sold for fifteen two months
ago. Some printed borders we can put
up at four dollars. ,
"" No,' I prefer Broche but can't you
take less ?""
I saw a twinkle in the merchant's eye,
which made me think he know she was
ordy shopping
"" Now,"" said he, "" if you wont men­
tion it, I'll let you have it for six.""
Sallie looked surprised. She knew
that style of article was selling at nine.
"" Six dollars is that your lowest ?""
""Well, to oblige you, I'll say four.""
A pause. "" Then you think that four
dollars is your very lowest ?""
"" Ahem ! We have a largo lot and I
want to dispose of them. I'll say two
dollars fifty cents.""
Still longer pause. "" Are you sure it
is a first rate piece of goods ?""
"" I'll warrant it all silk and wool.""
My friend was caught. Turning to me
she whispered :
"" I wisli I had brought some money,""
and then addressing the merchant, she
said, "" I'll call again.""
I never was so glad to get out of a
Ftore before, for the clerk had gathered
round us, seeming to understand the joke.
But Sallic went home, got the money,
and insisted on my returning with her to
the store for the shawl. The trader said
he was sorry, very, but the shawl had
just been sold. And so was Sallie, too,
I thought. We went shopping no more
that afternoon.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84023428/1860-12-28/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,vtu_jay_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Lamoille newsdealer.,S.

apprehend, the smothered indignation of the Free
States would be roused beyond control. It would
not be in the power of any one to restrain it. In
twenty days two hundred thousand men would be
in readiness to take vengeance on all who would
betray the Union into the bands of its enemies.—
Be assured that Ido not exaggerate the feelings of
the people. They are already sufficiently excited
at the attempt to dissolve the Union for no other
reason than that they constitutionally exercised the
most precious right conferred on them—of voting
for the person whom they considered the most wor­
thy and best qualified to fill the office of Presi­
dent. Fort Sumter, therefore, ought not, and I
presume, will not, be delivered over to South Car­
olina.

I am not, however, pleading for the Free States,
for tbey are not in danger, but for the Union and
the preservation of the Cotton States. Those who
sow the wind must expect to reap the whirlwind.
The leaders of South Carolina could not have no­
ticed that we live in an age of progress, and that
all Christendom is making rapid strides in the
march of civilization and freedom.* Iftheyhad,
they would have discovered that the announce­
ment of every victory obtained by the Hero of the
nineteenth century, Garibaldi, in favor of the op­
pressed of Italy, did not lail to electrify every
American heart with joy and gladness. ""Where
liberty dwells there is my country,"" was the de­
claration of the illustrious Franklin. This princi­
ple is too strongly implanted in the heart and mind
ot every man in the Free States to be surrendered
because South Carolina desires it, in order to ex­
tend the area of slavery. With all Christianized
Europe, and nearly all the civilized world, opposed
to slavery, are the Southern States prepared to set
aside the"" barriers which shield and protect their
institutions under the United States Government?
Would the separation oftheSouth from tbeNorth
give greater security to slavery than it has now
under the Constitution of the Union? What secu­
rity would they have for the return of runaway
slaves? I apprehend none, whilst the number of
runaways would be greatly augmented, and the
difficulties of which slaveholders complain would
be increased ten-fold. However much individuals
might condemn slavery, the free States are prepar­
ed to sustain and defend it, as guaranteed by the
Constitution.

In conclusion, I would avoid the bloody and des­
olating example ofthe Mexican States. I am, now
and forever, in favor ofthe Union, its preservation,
and the rigid maintenance of the rights and in­
terests of the States, individually and collectively.
Yours, &c., JOHN E. WOOL.""
GEM. WOOL TO GEN. CASS.
[Private.)
TROY, Dec. G, 18G0.
MY DEAR GENERAL:—OId associations and lormer
friendship induced me to venture to address you a
few words on the state of the country. Mv letter
is headed private, because I am not authorized to
address you officially.
I have read with pleasure the President's Mes­
sage. South Carolina says she intends to leave the
Union. Her representatives in Congress say she
has already left the Union. It would seem that she
is neither to be conciliated nor comforted. I com­
mand the Eastern Department, which includes
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and
Mississippi. You know me well. I have ever been
a firm, decided, faithful and devoted friend to my
country. If I can aid the President to preserve
the Union, I hope he will command my services.
It will never do for him or you to 1 eave Washing­
ton without every star in this Union is in its place.
Therefore no time should be lost in adopting meas­
ures to defeat those who are conspiring against the
Union. Hesitancy or delay may be no less fatal to
the Union than to the President, or your own high
standing as a statesman.

It seems to me that troops should be sent to
Charleston to man the forts in that harbor. You
have eight companies at Fort Monroe, Va. Three
or four of these companies should be sent without
a moment's delay to Fort Moultrie. It will save
the Union, and the President much trouble. It is
said that to sen! at this time troops to that harbor
would produce great excitement among the people.
That is nonsense, when the people are as much ex­
cited as tbey can be, and the leaders are determin­
ed to execute their long meditated purpose of sepa­
rating the State from the Union. So long as you
command the entrance to the city of Charleston,
South Carolina cannot separate herself from the
Union. Do not leave the forts in the harbor in the
condition to induce an attempt to take possession
of them. It might easily be done at this time. If
South Carolina should take them it might, as she
anticipates, induce other States to join her.
Permit me to entreat yeu to urge the President
to send at once three or four companies of Artillery
to Fort Moultrie. The Union can be preserved,
but it requires firm, decided, prompt and energet­
ic measures on the part of the President, lie has
only to exert the power conferred on him bv the
Constitution and laws of Congress, and all will be
safe, and he will prevent a civil war, which never
fails to call forth all the baser passions of the hu­
man heart. If a separation should take place, you
may rest assured blood would flow in torrents, fol­
lowed by pestilence, famine and desolation, and
Senator Seward's irrepressible conflict will be
brought to a conclusion much sooner than he could
possibly have anticipated. Let me conjure you to
save the Union, and thereby avoid the bloody and
desolating example of the States of Mexico. A
separation of the States will bring with it the des­
olation of the Cotton States, which are unprepared
for war. Their weakness will be lound in the
number of their slaves, with but few of the essen­
tials to carry on war, whilst the Free States have
all the elements and materials for war, and to a
greater extent than any other people on the face of
the globe.

Think of these things, my dear General, and save
the country, and save the prosperous South from
pestilence, famine and desolation. Peaceable se­
cession is not to ba thought of. Even if it should
take place, in three months we would have a
bloody war on our bands.
Very truly, your friend, JOHN E. WOOL.
Hon. Lewis Cass,
Secretary of State, Washington, D. C.

all the express provisions of our national Consti­
tution, and tbe Union will endure forever?It be­
ing Impossible to destroy it. except by some action
not provided for in tbe inatrument Itself.
Again, if tbe Uaited State* be not a government
proper, but an aaeociatlon of States in tbe nature
of contract merely, can It, as a contract, be peace­
ably unmade, by leas than all tbe parties wbo
made it? One party to a contract may violate
it?break it, so to apeak; but does It not require
all to lawfully rescind It?
Descending from these general principles, we
find tbe proposition that, In legal contemplation,
tbe Union is perpetual, confirmed by tbe history
of tbe Union Itself. Tbe Union is much older
than the Constitution, it was formed in fact, by
the Articles of Aasoclatlon in 1774. It was ma­
tured and continued by the Declaration of Inde­
pendence in 1776. It was further matured and

the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly
plighted and engaged that It should be perpetual,
oy the Article* of Confederation In 177>. And
finally, In 17*7, one of the declared object* for
ordaining and establishing the Constitution, was
""toform <t more perfect ssi'm.""
But If destruction of the Union, by one. or by a
part only, of the States, be lawfully possible, the
1' nion Is Its* perfect than before, the Constitution
having lost the vlUl element of perpetuity.
It follows from these views that no State, npon
Its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the
Union,?that retolves and ordinate* to that effect
are legally void; and that acts of violence, within
any State or States, against the authority of the
United States, are insurrectlonsry or revolution­
ary, according to circumstances.
1 therefore consider that. In view of the Consti­
tution and the laws, the (""nion Is unbroken and
to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as
the Constitution Itself expressly enjoins upon me,
that the laws of the I'uion be faithfully executed
In all the States. Doing this 1 deem to be only a
simple duty on my pari; and I shall perform it, so
fir 1~ ? ?1? *

... .. r.?.?v?'Kl uui'w ixiy ruuuui muirra, tue
American people, shall withhold the requisite
means, or, in some authoritative manner, direct the
contrary I trust this will not be regarded as a
menace, but only as the declared purpose of the
Union that It will constitutionally defend and
maintain itself
In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or
violence; and there shall be none, unless it be
forced upon the national authority. The power
confided to me will be used to bo',<l. occupy, and
possess the property and places belonging to the
Government, and to collect the duties and Im­
posts ; but beyond wbat may be necessary for
these objects, there will be no Invasion,?no using
of force against or among the people anywhere.
\Vhere hostility to the United States, In any Inte­
rior locality, shall be so great and so universal, as
to prevent competent resident citizens from hold­
ing the Federal oilic-s, there will be.no attempt
to force obnoxious strangers among the people for
that obj?ct While the strict legal right may
exist in the government to enforce the exercise of
these offices, the attempt to do so would be so ir­
ritating. and so nearly impracticable with all, 1
deem it better to forego, for the time, the usea of
such offices.
The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be
furnished In all parts of the Union So far as pos­
sible, the people everywhere shall have fhat sense
of perfect security which is most favorable to

calm thought and reflection. The course here In­
dicated will be followed, unless current event*
and experience shall show a modification- or
change to be proper, and in every case and ex:­
gency, my best discretion will be exercised, ac­
cording to circumstances actually existing, and
with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of
the national troubles, and the restoration of fra­
t?rnal sympathies aud attections.
That there are persons in one section or another
who seek to destroy the Union at all events, and
are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither af­
firm or deny; out if there be such, I need address
no word to them. To tUose, however,who really
love the Union, may I not speak?
He fore entering upon so grave a matter as the
destruction of ojr national fabric, with Ml its
benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it
not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?
WtUyou hazard so d?sperat? a step. while there
is any possibility that any portion of the ills you
fly from have no r?al existence? Will you. while
the certain ills you fly to, are greater than all the
real ones you fly from? Will you risk the coin­
mission of so fearful a mistake'
All profess to be content in the Union, if
all constitutional rights can be maintained
Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written In
the Constitution, has been denied ? 1 think Dot.

party can reach to the audacity of doing this.
Think, if vou can, of a single Instance In
which a plainly-written provision of the Consti­
tution has ever bean denied. If. by the mere force
of numbers, a majority ahouid deprive a minority
of any clearly-written constitutional right, ft
might, in a moral point of view, justify revolu­
tiou?certainly would, If such right were a vital
one. But such is not our cue. All the vital rights
of minorities and of Individuals are so plainly as­
sured to them, by affirmation and negotiation,
guarantee* and provisions, in the Constitution,
that sontroversles never arise concerning them,
lint no organic law can ever be framed with a
provision specifically applicable to every question
which may occur in practical adminislrntiou.
No foresight can anticipate, nor any document
of reasonable length contain express provisions for
all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor
be surrendered by national or by State authority ?
The Constitution does not expressly siy Map
Congress prohibit s.avery in the territories * The
Constitution does not expreacly say Must Con­
greos protect slsverv In the territories? The Con­
stitution does not expressly say.

From questions of this class spring all our con­
troversies, m we divide upon them into majorities
and minorities If the minority will not acqui­
esce, the majority must, or the Government must

GRAFTON, Va., June 18.

A man reached here to-day from Rich
mond alter a long and tedious journey
through the interior ot the State, lie re
ports that . the general impression along
tbe route, and claimed to be founded on
reliable information, that largo reinforce
ments of tho rebel army would be sent in
to Western Virginia immediately. They
were pressing all men into tbe ranks.
A report was brought here to-dav that
Fx-Congressman Garnctt had superceded
Portcrfield in oommand of the forces, and
was then at Iluttonville, about GO miles
from here.
It was also rumored that Gen. Wise
was about strengthening the forces at that
poiut. The truth will probably be ascer
tained to-morrow.
The rumored march on Cumberland by
way of Roraney is ascertained to have been
a feint movement, their destination being
evidently farther west
Col. Wallace, with the 11th Indiana
Regiment is still at Cumberland. .
No movement of Federal troops from
this point is yet indicated.

Washington, October 9. There is reason
to believe tbe report trom New urleans via

Mississippi. They are doubtless acting un
der instructions given long since, and en­
gaged in protecting the men building
batteries on each side of tbe river above tbe
Point, where tbe five mouths divide, for the
purpose of effectually blockading them alL
The guns to be mounted are probably the
twenty eight nine-inch Dablgren, which were
ordered for Pickens, and not being required
mere, were put asoore at tortugas.
The Mississippi will be effectu.illy closed
by tbese batteries. Twenty vessels could not
do it eo well.

which acceptance is pressed upon the War
Department by Governor Yates and otbers.
The Department is willing to accept one,
and the others as infantry. Tbe cavalry

Washington, October 9. The UcralTe
dispatch says if there is any desire for fight
in tbe rebels it is very likely they will be
gratified to-morrow, not only in frontbutup

Decerters from the rebel camp and our scouts
corroborate tbe opinion tbat tbe rebel army
is not disposed either to advance upon our
lineB or to accept tbe proffered battle. The
enemy is not discoverable in strength

The dispatches to tho War Department to­
day are more encouraging than heretofore

.Washington. OctoVier 9. The New York
Timet t special says Commander Chaancey
arrived here tbis evening from Uatteras
let. He reports that on Monday the rebels
organized an expedition to attack and recap­
ture tbe forts occupied by our forces.
expedition consisted of six steamboats
about three thousand men. The steamers
were loaded with heavy rilled cannon
morturs for throwing shells. The attack
simultaneous. Ibut ineffectual The forts
fired shells, and were a?isted by the vessels
rift the Inlet.
Afier a time the rebels retired, though
before two or three steamers bad been sunk,
going down with all on board. Judging
from tbe crowded appearance of the vevels,
it is estimated tbataboutseven hundred men
were drowned, besides a large loss must have
been sustained from the bursting of
shells and tbe plunging of our shot, as
guns were served in a most masterly manner.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84028745/1861-10-10/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,ohi_guildenstern_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Cincinnati daily press.,Henry Reed & Co.,Cincinnati [Ohio],"","",12284,9744,5320,17284,3,21444,28332,4,ohi_guildenstern_ver01/data/sn84028745/00280775320/1861101001/0170.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cincinnati,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/ohi_guildenstern_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84028745%2F00280775320%2F1861101001%2F0170.jp2/pct:57.284089,34.392207,24.808804,61.005224/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/ohi_guildenstern_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84028745%2F00280775320%2F1861101001%2F0170.jp2/pct:57.284089,34.392207,24.808804,61.005224/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Subxeriptionx to the Produce Loan :
Gesti.kmkn: Enquiries have been made from
various quarters?
]. Whether during the continuance of the
li.o.h' ""li: efforts .should he made to procuro further
.sn'tserijitions.
2. Whether the Government will authorize
promises Jo l>o held out of aid to the planters,
as an inducement to such further subscriptions.
The first enquiry seems to imply a misun!
dcrstanding ol t lie scheme of the subscriptions.
.Many persons Ijave supposed that the Government
was tu have some contiol of the produce
itself; others that the time of sale appointed
by the subscription was l<> he absolute and
unconditional. The capti >n at the head of the
lists, whim examined, will correct both these
errors. The subscription is routined to the i
proceeds of sales, and contains an order
on the commission merchant or factor of
the planter m pay over to the Treasurer
it,/, mint!:,! subscribed, in excbanpi; f.ir iloii- !

federate Bonds. The transaction is simply an
agreement by the planter to lend the Government
so inuuh money ; and, in order to cm- :
jilcte the transaction, a time and place arc ap i
pointed when ami while the parties may meet 1
to carry it out. The important point is, that <
it certainly shall be completed at some I <
time, and that is secured by the engagement ot I
the planter. Whether that time bo December |
or Jane ss simply a question of convenience, (
and works no injury to either party. The 1
Government is sure ol the eventual pay i
mcnt, and derives from that certainty no much
credit; and it loses nothing, because it gives
its bond only when the money is paid.
It is obvious, therefore, mat the subscription*.
are quite as valuable to tin: Government
during ilit* blockade us after ii. The blockade
simple suspends the completion ol the engagement.
It iu-coiiics the interest of both parties i
to ivait for a good price, and the Government
will readily consent to a postponement ol the
sale.
Veil perceive, then fore, thai it is desirable
to continue ynur exertions to increase the sub 1
scriptions ; and you are authorized to say that '
the Government will consent to a reasonable
extension of the time appointed for sale.
f!. The next inquiry is as to a promise ol '
material aid from the Government to the planters.
1
hi answering this enquiry, 1 run to speak in '
advance of any action ot Congress. What *
that body may see tit ! > do, it is net for tne to
determine. 1 ran express merely 'he views ot 1
this Department, and these must govern your '
action, until reversed by a higher authority.?
It would lie t. sutllcnmi answer to the enquiry, c
tosiy, that the nctinn ot the Government is 1
settled by the Constitution. No power is [
granted to any iJ.pnrtment to lend money for
the relief of any interest. Keen the power of
Congress in relation to money is confined to I
borrowing, and to clause can be found which t
would sanction s > stupendous uscheme as purchasing
the entire crop with a view to aid its s
owners. But it may bo said that the Oonsti- i
tution of the Pruvlsoiiial Government may be t
altered by Congress, and that it is the duty
of this Department to prepare the way for such <
alteration, if, in its judgment, the financial
necessities of the country demand the change.
1 am not disposed, then, to close t he enquiry
with the abrupt answer thus made by the Con- j
stitution ; and will proce* d to consider the (
subject upon its iniritisic merits. ,

Two jjlaf.-. of relief have been proposed. The
one i< lliar the Chm-rnmcni purchase
the enure crop of the country; tin: other tlmi
an advance should he maun of part of its value.
Jn either case the pay metit is to l>e ntade by
the issue of Treasury notes, and therefore, tl
we put aside f ir the present, the many and serious
objections to the possession, transput ta
tion and management of the crop by the Government,
it becomes simply ? question of
amount. To purchase tho whole crop would
require its whole value, less the amount of the
subscriptions made to the Government. If we
estimate the whole crop of cotton at 200 mil
lions and the subset ipitons at .oil millions, the |
purchase would then n quire 150 millions of
Treasury notes, and, if to this sum he added
the amount of values for other agricultural
products, which would certainlv claim the sumo
benctii, the sum required would probably reach
175 millions.
The amount called for by the other plan of
making an advance, would depend upon the i
proportion of that advance. Few of the :?d ;
vocatcs of this plan have put it lower than t
five cents per pound on cotton, and at the ,
same rate upon ruber | ruduce. It may, there- a
fore, be very fairly set down at about one hint- j
dred millions. f
if we consider first, the least, objectionable
of these plane, it is certainly that which te t
quires the smaller sum ; and if this be. found i
impracticable, the larger must ?f necessity be j
rejected Our enquiry, then, may be narrow- i
:d down u. a proposal that the Government c
.shall issue one hundred millions of Treasury t
notes, to be distributed among the planting v
community upon the pledge of tin: forlhc.un u
ing crop. t
The tir>i remarkable leatiiru in ibis scheme a
i?, that it proposes that a new Govern men 1, j
yet struggling for existence, should reject all ?
ihe lessons ol experience, and undertake that r

which no Government, however longestablish- t.
t-d, has yet succeeded in effecting. The ""or- i
giiiiz.ilion of labor hns called forth many ingenious
nttetupts, bulli speculative and praeti r
cal, among well established Governments, but \
always with disastrous failure. With us, j
however, the experiment is proposed to a new r
Government, which is engaged in a gigantic 1
war, and which must rely on credit to furnish
means In carry on that war Our enemies o
are in po-sessiuii of ail the munitions and ,
work-shops which have been collected during t
forty-live years of peace?their fleets lutvc been i
built tip Hi our own j tint expense. With all j
these on hand, they yet. am obliged to expend c
nearly ten millions of dollars per week to car- ^
ry on lite war. Can w?- expect to con tend j
with them at less than half that expenditure V t
Supposing that it in ay require 'JbO millions of c
dollars; then the proposal is that at a lime c
when we are called upon to raise this large
hum for the support of Government, we shall
raise a further sum of luO millions for the benefit
of the planting interest.
For be it observed, Gr.-.l, that the Govern
ment receives no benefit whatever from this advance.
The money is paid to each individual
planter, and in exchange the Government
receives only his bond or note.?or, if the cut
ton bo purchased, the Government K-ecivos
only certain bales of cotton. That is to say,
the Government pays out money which is need '
ful to its very existence, and receives in ex J
change planters' noli-s or produce, which if 11
does not need and cannot in any way make use n
of. f
It must be observed, in the next place, that 3
Treasury Notes have now become the currency j,
of the country. They are, therefore, at present,
the measures of value. In this view it is j,
the duly of the Government to iitnil tfi'-ii irsu**,
as far ns practicable, to that amount which is ^
the limit of its currency. Every person &c- ^
quaintcd with this branch of political science, is
aware that if the currency passes this point, it {'
not oid; jj'ieronies depreciated, but it disturbs
.-winriiimi of Mioieiv itt-or-iselv as thouch

an arbitrary authority should chang'- the '
weights and measure' of the country. fT the s
currency of a country should he suddenly extended
Irom one hundred to two hundred toil* w
lions of dollars, thai, w hi-ffi was measured hy (
one dollar is now measured by two, and every &
article must be rated at twice its former price.
Of course all contracts are disturbed. The J-.
debt incurred before llio increase ir discharged
by paying one half its fanner value?; and each J,,
article purchased must be paid for at double ^
its former price. Ti e Government, from the nc- ^
<:rs.-ities of war, is t lie largest of ail purchasers, a
and thus, by a kind of suicidal act, compels j.
itself to pay two dollars lor what one would (j
have formerly purchased. And, at this rate ft|
of advance, two hundred millions of dollars can ^
effect no more, than one hundred millions of cj
dollars would have etil-rued before; or, iu
o'hir words, one hundred millions of dollars ^
are actually sunk in the operation.
Such a condition of the currency, the Gov .
ernmont has anxiously endeavored' to guard ^
against. The war tax was laid for the purpose
of creating a deinanu for Treasury N?.tcs, and
a security for their redemption. Their re- ^
rlundnncy has been carefully guarded against
by allowing them to be funded in eight per
cent, bonds. If necessity shall compel the
Government to issue fur the defence of the
country, and to keep out two hundred millions, |
it is plain thai every accession must impair
ind may defeat all these precautions. U
If the (rovcrnment should undertake, for the j,
>ake of private interests, so large an increase
jf issues, it may hazard its entire credit and
stability. The experiment is too dangerous, R
ind relief for the planters must be sought in D
mnie other direction. And may not that reme- M
ly be found ? to
In the first place, let the planters immediate-1 M

? ' irn?r?.*ff'I'TCJIrtiKia
]y tako measures for winter crops, to relieve
the demand lor grain and provisions. Let
them proceed to divert part of their labor from,
cotton, and make their own clothing and supplies.
Then let them apply to the great resource
presented by the money capital in
banks and private hands. Let this capital
come forward and assist the agricultural interest.
Heretofore the hanks have employed
a large part of their capital in the purchase uf
Northern exchange. Let them apply this portion
to factors' acceptances of planters' drafts
secured by pledge of the produce in the planters'
hands. An extension ill ilic time usually
allowed on these drnfts would overcome
must of the dillietillics. This extension could
safely reach the probable time of sale of the
crops, inasmuch as the suspension of specie
payments throughout the en tiro Confederacy
relieves each hack Iroru calis tor coin. The
hanks are accustomed to manage loans of this
character, and will conduct the operation with
such skill as will make them mutually advantageous.
The amount, of advance a-ked from
the banks would be greatly less than if ad
vanoes were oilVred by the Government; arid nil
the abuses incident to government agencies

would be avoided.
It.seems to iiif, thettlbrv, thai it is neither
accessary nor expedient that the Governim-nt
thculd embark upon this dangerous experi
merit. It is far better that each class of the
xmimuriity hnuld endeavor tu secure its own
existence by ii.suwn exertions, and if a;? etlbrt
In- at once marie by so intelligent a class as the
abutters, it will result in relief. Delay in these
Hurts, occasioned by vatigo expectations oi ie
ie! from Government, which cannot he real
red, may defeat that which is yet practicable.

' The Latest News.
There has been lor several days an unusual dearth
of news in regard to the movements of our armies.
At last accounts General Lee's forces were m the
neighborhood of Winchester, chiefly at Bunker Hill
Our forces are said to be in excellent condition, and
their numbers largely increased.
The enemy has advanced in strong force across
the Potomac at several points and a battle has been
expected daily. Whether McClellan will attack
Gen. Lee in his present position may be doubtful.
We think the indications are, that Richmond is
still the object of the enemy, and that the attempt
will be made to move upon it from all points.
From Kentucky and the South we have nothing
very important Our telegraphic dispatches give
the latest information.
We learn that two Yankee gunboats went up
Blackwater river some days ago, when a portion of
Col. Ferebcc's Cavalry dismounted and attacked
them, killing six of those on board.
P. S. Gen. Van Dorn has obtained a victory at
Corinth. See dispatch. -
The Conservative Meet ins oa Saturday Last.
We invite attention to the proceedings of the
Conservative Meeting held in this City on Saturday
last The meeting was large and enthusiastic, and
the best spirit prevailed.
It will be seen that CoL Daniel G. Fowle was
nominated to fill the vacancy in the House of Com­
mons, occasioned by the death of Mr. Miller. With
all respect for the claims of other gentlemen, we
think the meeting has made an excellent selection.
CoL Fowle is a gentleman of fine attainments, and
will ably, and no doubt acceptably represent the
County in tke House of Commons. We do not
know whether he is to have opposition or not; but
if he should, and if the Conservatives of the Coun­
ty should turn out in force, as we feel sure they
will, he will be elected by a large majority.
The Fever at Wilmington. We deeply regret
to learn that there is no abatement of the fever in
Wilmington, though the disease appears to be sub­
mitting to treatment more readily than at first.
The promptitude of Charleston and Mobile, and oth­
er places in extending their sympathy by sending
physicians, nurses, and necessary comforts, is high­
ly commendable. It will be seen that our citizens
have taken steps to afford such relief as they can.
It is hoped that all will aid liberally.
The Journal reports during the week ending on
Friday evening last, 267 new cases and 82 deaths.
The mortality is very large, yet it is probable that
it is even larger than that obscure cases no doubt
escaping efforts to ascertain them. We trust in a
few days a marked change for the better will be
manifest
f We are indebted to Hon. Mr. Oldham, ""of
Tesas, for a pamphlet copy of his able speech on
the Conscription Act

flour should admonish our planters throughout the
State to sow largely of wheat for the next crop.

WoRTnv or Imitation. The State Convention of
South-Carolina at its late session adopted a resolu­
tion, providing for the public registration by a proper
officer of all the names of the officers and soldiers of
that State who have or shall fall during the war in
the service of their country, whether killed in bat­
tle or dying from wounds or disease contracted in the
service, with the company or corp3 to which they
belonged, &c. We hope our next Legislature will
cause such a rceord or memorial to be made of all
the dead of this State, with a proper notice of any
remarkable instances of daring, 4a
The Yarbkouch Will Case. This important
case was argued and decided at the last term of
Wake Superior Court, (last week) his Honor Judge
Heath presiding. It appears that Col. Yarbrough,
during his last illness, made two wills. By the
first he gave to his children his real estate, and to
his wife eight thousand dollars in cash ; and by the
second will he gave the real estate to his wife, and
the cash mentioned to his children. The first will
was made the 21st, and the last the 25th of March,
a few days before he died. The Hon. George E.
Badger and H. A. Badham, Esq., appeared for the
first will, and B. F. Moore and G. W. Haywood,
Esquires, for the last The case was very ably ar­
gued on both sides, and the. jury declared the first
will to be the true one. The real estate, (the Ho­
tel) therefore, goes -to the children, and the eight
thousand dollars to his widow.
We conclude to-day the publication of an essay on
Free Trade. We differ with the writer in many of
bis views, but it must be conceded that be has han­
dled the subject with ingenuity and ability.

The rumor brought by late telgraphic dispatches
that Gen. Phelps and Com. Porter are been cap­
tured by the Confederate gun-boat, No. 290, at the
mouth of the Mississippi is all bosh. They arrived
W New York in the steamer Roanoke a fortnight ago.
The Yankee Cavalry have certainly visited W""ar­
ronton, Va., and captured and paroled about 2,500
of our sick and wounded soldiers who were incapa­
ble of making any resistance. Is that allowable by
the cartel?

Llncolnigm Ko. 2. ; .
Two days after Lincoln issued bis emancipation
proclamation, he sent forth another of which the
following b an xtrtct:""'.. .. V
"" Whereas, It baa become necessary to call into
service not only volunteers but also portions of the
militia of the States, by draft, in order to suppress
the insurrection existing in the United States ; and
disloyal persons are not adequately restrained by
the ordinary processes of the law from hindering
this measure and from giving aid and comfort in
various wajs to the insurrection. Now, therefore,
be it ordered
First That during the existing insurrection, and
as a necessary measure for suppressing the same,
all rebels and insurgents, their aiders and abettors
within the United States, and all persons discourag­
ing volunteer enlistments, resisting militia drafts,
or guilty of any disloyal practice, affording aid and
comfort to the rebels against the authority of the
United States, shall be subject to martial law, and
liable to trial and punishment by courts martial or
military commissions;
Second That the writ of habeat corpvt is sus­
pended in respect to all persons arrested, or who
are now, or hereafter, during the rebellion, Bhall be,
imprisoned in any fort, camp, arsenal, military prison
or other place of confinement, by any. military au­
thority or by the sentence of any court-martial or
military commission."" j
He has thus assumed and practices without the
name, the powers and tyranny of the Military Dic­
tator puts a lock upon every man's mouth closes
the mouth of the public press exercises a censor­
ship over every man's thoughts and acts arrests
him for every act judged to bo treasonable by his
sworn pimps and spies brings him before a bloody
court of his own appointment, and cuts off his last
hope for liberty by suspending at will the writ of
habeat corpus all over the land. If the North sub­
mits to this, and we fear she is sufficiently enslaved
to do it, her days of civil liberty are numbered.
All this Lincoln does and thousands justify his acts
as a 44 military necessity.' According to his avow­
ed doctrine, there is nothing he cannot do in a state
of war as commander-in-chief, if he consider it nec­
essary to be done to save the State. This is the plea
of despotism every where and in all ages. -
Now here in the South, every man denounces all
these acts as tyrannical and devilish, and yet there
are those who would have President Davis pursue
the same course. There are not a few, who would
sanction to-morrow the assumption of the Military
Dictatorship by President Davis. They advocate
and justify the arrest and imprisonment of citizens
who have heretofore borne a good character, upon
mere suspicion they would deny their own fellow­
citizens against whom they cannot alledge a fault,
except a difference in political opinion, the right of
trial by jury or the writ of habeat corpus. They
sanction the most cruel acts upon the part of mili­
tary tyrants against subordinates and citizens they
will endorse whatever the authorities may do, how­
ever nuch against law or without law. Many of
them are par excellence State rights men, and yet
they would surrender every right claimed by the
States to the will of the President, unless it came
in direct conflict with their own personal interests.
They are for pressing every man into the war ex­
cept themselves and their particular favorites, unless
they can secure offite and position. In other words,
they are for a despotism, provided they and their
friends can be the lieutenants and subordinates of
the despot
Soldier's Claims. Many of our brave soldiers
have recently been killed in battle or have died
from wounds or disease contracted in camp. It
is likely the government was in debt to many of
them, and their wives and children may be in much
need. To such widows and other claimants, we
again suggest the easiest method of obtaining it
According to the law, we believe, the wife is the
first claimant, the children next, father next, mother
next; if he have neither wife, child, father or moth­
er, then the claim goes to the nearest of kin.
Let the soldier's widow, therefore, if he have one,
and if not the child, or father, or mother, as the
case may be, apply to any intelligent magistrate,
and make oath that the deceased soldier, naming
him, who belonged to such a company and such a
regiment, and died, or was killed at such a time
and place, and was the husband, father or son of the
witness, and that there is no nearer claimant living
than the witness. Let the magistrate then testify
on the same affidavit to the credibility of the wit­
ness. Then take the affidavit to the Clerk of your
County Court, and get the Clerk to certify, under
the County seal, that the above named magistrate is
a bona fide Justice of the Peace for said County.
Get any responsible friend to take the affidavit to
Richmond, if going, or send it to the member of Con­
gress from your district, paying the postage, Ac.,
to collect it for you from the War Department We
make this suggestion to guard poor soldiers' widows
and orphans against sending the claim to agents for
collecting such claims, who make exhorbitant char­
ges for their labor. Some charge 10 per cent for
collecting, which often deprives the needy of a good
portion of the claim.
Information. A correspondent at Cold Spring,
Carroll County, Ya., desires us to make known to
the authorities in this State, that there is a man
who calls himsel James Gurlsy, a deserter from
this State, now living on the Blue Ridge, near Pi­
per's Gap, who has a horse and wagon, and has
been hauling liquor about in that country and pas­
sing counterfeit money. Our informant says that
Gurley admits that he has a family below High
Point, and that he stabbed a man while at Camp
Mangum. He can be found near Cold Spring, Car­
roll County, Ya.
Capt. W. T. Marsh. We regret to learn that
this gallant officer received a wound in the battle of
Sharpsburg, of which he died on the 24th Septem­
ber. We saw his servant on Saturday last, who
showed us Capt M's watch, which was struck by
the bullet that caused his death. The watch is a
small gold one, and was in his over-shirt pocket on
bis left breast The ball struck the lower part of
the watch, crushed and bent it, and passed into his
tody. ..Capt M. lingered for about a week at the
house of Mr. McQuilton, two miles this side of
Shepardstown, where he was kindly nursed and
cared for. Captain M. belonged to the 2d State
Troops, having entered the service at the beginning
of the war.' He was a young man of much promise.
He was a member of the last Legislature from Beau­
fort County, and hail been reelcdted a member of
the present Legislature.
Edward Everett, of Boston, in a late speech,
falsely insists upon it that there are still in the
South many Union men who are waiting to be de­
livered by Yankee arms. Gen. Fremont, in another
speech, tells a different story. He says in his cam­
paigning in Virginia he did not find a Union man
certainly he did not see a Union woman. -

A Goon Idea. The Richmond Equirer states
that there are twenty or thirty ladies employed in
signing Confederate Treasury notes, Ac., in the
Treasury Depatment in that city. This gives a
chance to the young men to enter the army. Bring
the ladies into the business of the country the
men are needed elsewhere.

Northern News.
A friend has handed us several copies of the New
York Tribune, Timet, Herald and Pott, of recent
dates, from which we -learn that Lincoln's procla­
mation in regard to slavery b generally approved,
and that the war spirit is as rampant in the North
as ever. There may be, and there no doubt b a
strong under current in the Northern States against
Lincoln and his measures, but, so far as we can
judge by the papers before us, the people are gen­
erally sustaining him in his despotic conduct , Yet
the Tribune, in the mid6t of its fierce and wicked
assaults on the South, seems to fear that liberty b
not safe in the Northern States. In his issue of
the 4th September Greely says:
44 In times of great public peril like the present,
it seems necessary to wink at official acts of arbitrary
power which would not be endured for a moment
in a state of peace. We do not surrender our liber­
ties, but we hold them in abeyance while the Na­
tion's fate trembles in the balance. - We are living
under a regime not of Law but of Force. "" In war,
the Law is silent,"" is the gist of a very old maxim.
Any of ns may be snapped up at a moment's notice
and immured in prison indefinitely, without other
warrant than some functionary's order. And who­
ever is must make the best of his fate, knowing that
all this is casual and transitory. In our poor judg­
ment, nine-tenths of the arbitrary arrests thus far
had far better not been made ; but we would not
deprive the Government of the power to make them
in a crisis like the present Let it be distinctly
understood, however, that each arrest will be made
the subject of rigorous and dispassionate inquiry
after Peace, and that, while no one should suffer for
his innocent mistakes in honestly endeavoring to
serve and save his country, it will go very hard with
any one who is proved to have gratified his own
malice or his lore of exercising despotic power,
withont the warrant of a public necessity.
What we mainly apprehend, however, b not that
individuals shall suffer they always do and must
suffer in a convulsion like this but that the talu­
tary popular instinct which regards with jealovty
every infringement oj constitutional tafeguardt for
Liberty may be debauched and broken down. We
fear there are too many patriots this day who, if
their hearts were laid upon, would be willing to
reward with an imperial crown the Military genius
who should speedily and utterly crush out the
Rebellion. In view of this tendency, it is in one
sense fortunate that our struggle has as yet develop­
ed no Cromwell, Napoleon, nor even an Andrew
Jackson. Corrupted as public sentiment has become
by forty years' truckling to the Slave Power, too
many might be ready to evince their gratitude to the
saviour of our Nationality by making him a present
of our Liberty.""
Terrible visions, it seems, of military power and
imperial crowns are floating before even the aboli­
tionists of the North. If they are alarmed at the

concentration of all power in the hands of one man, 1
what must be the dread for the future of the
thoughtful and conservative portion of the North­
ern people. I
The Herald of the 27th August contains shock­
ing accounts of the murders and ravages committed
by the Sioux Indians on the frontiers of Minnesota.
Whole towns and settlements had been exterminat­
ed by the Indians. The most active military pre­
parations were on foot to check the incursions of the
Indians. The attack b attributed to the failure on
the part of Lincoln's government to make the an­
nual payment to the Indians in time.
These papers teem with accounts of the raising
of battalions and regiments, and statements of what
the different States and towns and counties are do­
ing in thb respect It seems to be highly probable,
judging by these accounts, and by the tone of the
leading presses of the North, that Lincoln will be
able to raise as many troops as he wants.
Capt. R. S. Tucker. This worthy and gallant
officer is now on a brief visit to his family and friends
in this City. We are indebted to him for the list
of our sick and wounded in Washington, which ap­
pears in another column. Capt T. visited Wash­
ington recently with a flag of truce to see about the
condition of our sick and wounded. He was at first
refused admission, but at length succeeded in get
ting through the lines through the interposition of
CoL Luko Lyman, of the Yankee forces. Capt T.
found our sick and wounded doing as well as could
be expected. They were cheerful, and well treated,
and the expectation is that they will be released in
a few days.
Eastern Counties.
Our information from the North-eastern Counties
beyond the Chowan and Albemarle Sounds, repre­
sents them to be in a deplorable condition. Full
one half of the negroes have been run off by the
Yankees, and every species of property is constant­
ly subject to their depredations. In the Eastern
Counties matters are no better. Every day adds to
their misery, which must be increased by the en­
forcement of the Yankee confiscation act, which will,
doubtless, soon be executed.
The course of Butler in New Orleans, and the
spirit of Yankee rule in Missouri, will be inaugurat­
ed in North-Carolina. CoL Polk, of Missiouri, has
been robbed of half a million of property, and his
family are said to be entirely dependent upon the
charities of others. The homestead of even Presi­
dent Taylor, which he bequeathed to his son, has
been confiscated, and thousands of wealthy men all
over the land hare been reduced to poverty.
Now what can our people in Eastern Carolina ex­
pect better from their enemies? 44 Gov. Stanly""
has held out to them the hope of protection to them­
selves and their property,"" if they will take the oath
of allegiance ; but the late proclamation of Lincoln
shows that, 60 far at least as negroes are concerned,
it b no projection whatever. The idea that only
the slaves of ""rebels"" are to be declared free on
the first of January next, is a cheat and a decep­
tion. Men who have shamefully violated their own
consciences and taken the oath, have found out the
deception when it was too late. We again admon­
ish our Eastern people not to trust to the hypocrisy
and false pretences of Yankees longer. Let them
remove all their movable property as soon as pos­
sible.In the mean time we beg to assure all the people
of the East, that every effort will be made for their
defence and protection during the coming winter.
We know that Gov. Yance is deeply interested in
affording every possible protection to them. Their
condition and wants will be fully laid before Presi­
dent Davis, and the government will be urged, in
the strongest terms, to afford them ample protec­
tion. What is lacking on the part of the Confeder­
ate government will be promptly afforded by Gov.
Vance, as far as ho has the power and tho means to
do so. We trust the efforts of both governments
may prove every way effective.
The rumor is again started, that in commercial
circles in Europe, it is predicted that the Southern
Confederacy will be soon recognised, and that nego­
tiations between France and Russia are in progress
to effect that object The story has 'been told too
often to be believed.
' Death or Capt. Guns. We record with deep re­
gret the death of Capt Chalmers Glenn, of Rocking­
ham, of the 13th regiment He fell in the battle of
Sharpsburg, and was buried by his comrades on the
field, his grave having been dug with their bayo­
nets. Peace to hb ashes. ' A nobler soldier sleeps

This Bloody War. ''. ' .-'
Who can estimate the weight of responsibility :
which hangs upon the Bonis of those wicked and.
evil-guided men, who, by years of toil and labor,
brought upon tha country thb bloody' war X Time
can never develop nor cure the evils which already
have been inflicted by their demon-like agency.
A writer in a late Northern paper says it has al­
ready cost the North the lives or the ruin of 400,000
.persons. The debt incurred by Lincoln tnd his
party cannot be less than $2,000,000,000 already.
The demoralization of the North its recklessness
of moral principle its stark mad infidelity, b almost
universal. Repudiation and infidelity in its treaties
and contracts will mark its future history.' Its re­
formation cannot be effected in a century.
' Upon the South, the ruin b incalculable. One
hui dred thousand brave men have either died, or
their constitutions broken down, or they are maimed,
rendering them a burden to themselves or to society.
The loss in property cannot' now be estimated.
And where b the ruin to end f From tho North
there is nothing to hope from Europe we can look
for no sympathy. Nothing, perhaps, could gratify
English statesmen more than the utter ruin of both
North and South. -
A Philadelphia write, an abolitionbt of course,
alluding to Lincoln's emancipation proclamation,
says it was what was demanded both by the North
and by. Europe. He thinks it closes np all prospect
of European interference.
Our reliance must be, as we have always said,
upon the justice of our cause, the arm of Divine
Providence, and the valor of our troops.
The Yankees are violating the cartel in every way. At
Sbepherdstown 700 Yankee paroled prisoners werere-captured,
and it is said the Harper's Ferry prisoners are sent
off to fight the Indians in Minnessota.
The flax culture in Island has not been much increased
by the scarcity of cotton in Europe.

CONSERVATIVE MEETING IN WAKE.
A large and rcspectablo meeting of the Conserva­
tives of Wake County was held in Raleigh, on Sat­
urday the 4th instant, to nominate a candidate for
the House of Commons, to fill the vacancy occa­
sioned by the death of Henry W. Miller.
On motion of Gen. R. W. Haywood, Allen Adams,
Esq., was called to the Chair, and Messrs. Joseph
D. Hayes and William S. Mason were appointed
Secretaries.
The' Chairman having explained the object of the
meeting, on motion of Mr. Holden, a committee of
five was appointed to draft resolutions for the action
of the meeting. The Chairman appointed Messrs.
W. W. Holden, William H. Hood, Nathan Ivy, Ed­
ward ChappelL, and Stephen Stephenson. The com­
mittee having retired for a short time, returned and
reported through Mr. Holden, the following resolu­
tions :
Jitsolced, That in common with onrTellowcitizens of all
parties, we deeply deplore the death of Henry W. Miller,
one of the Cuinnoners elect from this County to theLegislature-
We will long cherish the recollection of his no­
ble qualities of mind and ueart, and of his patriotic dero­
tion to the State and to the caime of Southern indepen­
dence.Jietolctd, That we congratulate the people of the State
on the result of the late elections, by which Col. Vance
was made Gorernor and a Conservative Legislature se­
cured. We point with pride and satisfaction to the Inau­
gural speech of Gov. Vance, as embodying the sentiments
and wishes of the whole people of this State in this great
emergency; and we pledge ourselves, as heretofore, to
wage the war in defence of oar country as lung as a hostile
foot is on our soil.
Rttolved, That we, the Conservatives of the County of
Wake, are determined to maintain nnity and harmony
among ourselves, and to do our full part in preserving lib­
erty at home while our brave soldiers are contending for it
in the field ; and that, as one of tbe important results of
the late election, we confidently expect that oar State gov­
ernment will be reformed, and our sea-coast Counties pro­
tected as far as possible sgainst tbe ravages of the enetnv.
Jieeoivett, That we respectfully suggest that this meeting
vote by ballot, each Conservative present being entitled to
one vote; that a majority nf all the votes cast shall be nec­
essary to nominate a candidate ; and that we pledge our­
selves to support tbe nominee of this meeting.
After some remarks by Mr. Holden, setting forth
in a clear and forcible .manner the pnnciples of tho
Conservative party, and paying an eloquent tribute
to the memory of the late Henry W. Miller, the
resolutions were unanimously adopted.
The meeting then proceeded t ballot for a candi­
date. CoL Nathan Ivy nominated CoL Daniel G.
Fowle, and R. W. Sea well, Esq., nominated Maj.
Willie D. Jones. CoL Geo. Little and Peleg Rogers,
Esq., were appointed to superintend the election.
They reported that of the votes cast CoL Fowle bad
received 109, Maj. Jones 28, scattering 8. CoL
Fowle was then declared duly nominated, and
Messrs. W. W. Holden, W. 11. Hood, and J. J.
Litchford were appointed to inform him of hb
nomination and request his acceptance. CoL Fowle
soon after appeared, and accepted the nomination in
an impressive and eloquent speech ; after which, on
motion, the meeting adjourned.

CM the difficulty of making any National bouu i
dary line.
The President then su;rgi;st$ amendments to
the Constitution Congress concurring to be 1
proposed to the Legislatures or conventions of
the several States; which, if ratified by ihiee
fourls ol said Legislatures, la be noted as parts
of said Constitution.
The first article proposes that all States abol
ishing slavery before January 1. shall re-1
reive compensation from tbe United States.
Second. All slaves treed by chances of war any ,
time lielore the end of the rebellion, shall be for- ;
ever free; but all owners who had not been dis j
loyal, shall be compensated .
Third. Congress may appropriate money and j
oiheiwise provide for colonizing free colored per­
sons with their consent at any place without the
United States.
The President discusses these articles at some !
length and asks if then, for a common object, I
! 'ave property is to be sacriöced, is it not just that
j it be done at a common charge; and if with less
I money or money more e siiy pud, we can pre-
serve the benefits of the Union by this means
I than we can by the war alone, is it not economi
i cal to do it? The proposed emancipation would
shorten this war, perpetual peace ensue, and in­
Ciease in population and proportionate) v the
! 7-aIth of the country.
The President says the plan consisting of these
articles, is recommended not but that a reslora
tion of the national authority would be arcepted
! witltout its adoption, nor will the war or the pro
I ceedings under the proclamation of September
22i be stayed because ol the recominendaiiou of
j this plan; its adoption. I doubt nov would bring
restoration and thereby stay both, and notwith
j standing this plan, the recommendation that Con­
l gres provides by law for compensating any
I States which mav adopt the emancipation before
this plan shall have been acted upon, ia hereby
earnestly renewed. This plan is recommended
as a means, uot in conclusion of, but additional
to all others for restoring and preserving the
national authority throughout the Union.

The occupation ?>f Fredericksburg having been success,
fully accomplished, the nest move was to drive the rebels
from their strongholds in Iho rear of the city. The lines
mf the rebels, which extended in the form of a semi-circle
from Port Royal to a point about sis miles above Fred­
?ricksbnrg, were strongly fortified and protected by a
range of high hiiis. stonewall Jackson occupied the right
Snug, extending from Port Royal to Guinncy'e Station

General Longstrcet the centre, extending to the
telegraph road, and Generals Lee end Stuart the left­

The entire rebel force was estimated at 200,000 men, and
Wccupied s front or not less than twenty mile3. The
troops wero for Uic most part veterans who hod fought
through all the peninsular campaign, while the officers
were the ablest that the 8outh could produce. It was
so mean enemy we bad to contend with, I assure you.
The disposition of the Union forces occupied the whole
?f Friday night aud Saturday morning, and, as General
Xtarnetde was anxious to commence the attack at as early
an hour as possible, there was not much cbauce for the
Voope to rest themselves. A few^stragglers, it is true,
anauaged to sneak away for tbo purpose of pillaging; but
the great mass of the soldiers were constantly under
arms. Gen. Bnrnside was in the ally all night, personally
Inspecting the troops and directtug their move,
taenia. H was arranged that General Franklin's
?orps should cross the river two miles below tht
City, with the view of turning the enemy's position on
llaseapooax creek, while Uooker would engage the
rebels nearer the centre, and Sumner would turn their
right. By this arrangement It will be seen that Frank­
lin was opposed to Rtonewall Jackson, while Hooker
and Sumner attacked the centre and left nf the rebels
coder Loagetreet and Lee.
The eventful morning came, and with It a dense fog­
which obscured the movements of the enemy,

Sequence of the fog no observation eonld be had
However, the dispoeilieo of the Union forces had
been made, and General Burnstde determined to com­

Franklin moved his column, consisting of the
Pint and Sixth corps, just before sunrise, his
right resting oo the outskirts of the city, his centre ad­
vanced a mile or so from the river, and his left resting on
Ibe Rappahannock about three mhos below. Fkirmlshiug
commenced a few minutes after daylight on tbo extreme

Bth and 9th of September next, I desire,
through yonr columns, and in advance of
the next issue of my own paper, to notify
the wheat-growers of Wisconsin of said
exhibition, and to urge the advantage
which might be derived from a competi­
tion on their part.
The premiums are not so large as to be,
of themselves, a snliicient inducement,
but inasmuch as Wisconsin has really
produced some of the best wheat hitherto
grown in this country, as well as the larg­
est yield of any one State in the Union, it
seems to me very desirable that her high
high reputation for quantity should be
added to by a satisfactory demonstration
of superior quality.
But there is still another important rea­
son why our State should be represented.
Experience has shown that wheat, as well
as other grains—and, perhaps, to a greater
degree than most others—is improved by
an occasional change of seed. The pro­
posed Exhibition will afford an excellent
opportunity for exchange, and the best
possible selection ot new and approved
varieties foi trial.

The premiums and conditions of com­
petition are as follows:
For the Bst HO bushels of White Winter
Wheat $l5O 00
For the Second Beet do 75 00
For the Best 20 bushels lied Winter Whea 10*1 OU
For the Second Best do do 50 00
For the Beet 2 bushels White Winter Wheat 50 00
Fur the Second Best do do 25 00
For the Best 2 bushels Ked Winter Wheat.. AO 00
Fur the Second Best do do 20 00
For the Best 2 bushels Spring Wheat. .... 20 00
For the Second Best do do 10 00
** Competitors ter these Brizes will be required
to furuisn samples of the wheat in the ear and
with the Straw attacl ed, (say fifty ears of wheat
and straw,) also to lurnish a written statement of
the nature of the soil ou which the wheat grew,
method of cultivation, time ol sowing, quantity of
seed sown, manures (if any used,) and mode and
time of application ; also the time of ripening and
harvesting, and the yield per acre, with such other
parti ulars as may he deemed ot practical Impor­
tance ; also the name by which the variety is known
in the locality where it was grown. The Wheat
must ho one variety, pure, and unmided. The
pnze to he awarded to the actual grower of the
wheat, and the wheat which takes a prize is to be­
come the proper, y of the Society.”
The time of holding this Fair has been
fixed so as to enable farmers to purchase
seed for (ah sowing from the wheat enter
ed lor competition.
Should there be a disposition ou the
part of the farmers of this State to com­
pete, I have hut little doubt that arrange­
ments can be made with all the interme­
diate railroads for transportation of both
gra.n and exhibitors at reduced rates.—
Presuming upon such disposition, I shall,
at all events, endeavor to make such ar­
rangements on their behalf, announcing
the result of my negotiations as early as
practicable.
Notice of intent to compete, or enqui­
ries for further information as to the Ex­
hibition, may be addressed to Joseph
Harris, Rochester, N. Y.
The promise ol a great crop of good
wheat was hardly ever heller, in this
State, than to-day. Let us hope that our
farmers will avail themselves ot this op­
portunity to make the most of it.
Respectfully, J. W. Hott,

CIRCULAR No. 47.
War Def’t Brovost Marshal Gm.’s Office, t
Washington, D. U., July 17, 1563. $
Drafted men become soldiers of the United
States by the fact ol their names having been
drawn in the dralt. The notification served ou
them by the Brovost Marshal is merely an announce­
ment of the fact, and an order for them to report
for duty at a designated time and place.
The following opinion of Hon. Wm. Whiting,
the Solicitor of the War Department is published
for the information of all concerned
“ Y\ hen a person has been drafted in pursuance
of the enrollment act of March 1563, notice of
such dralt must be Served witbir. ten days, and
thereafter by written or printed notice, to be served
on him personally, or by leaving a copy at his last
place of residence, requiring him to appear at the
reude.vous and report for duty. Any person fail­
ing to report for doty after notice beu.g left at his
last place of re-’denco, or served on him personal­
ly, without furnishing a substitute or pt ving three
hundred dollars, is pronounced by law t he a de­
serter.
“Ue may be arrested and held for tr Iby court
martial and sentenced to death.
•* If person ihange his place of re? Isace after
being dratted “Od before receiving no ice, it may
still bo served by leaving at his last piaco of resi­
dence, and if he does not appear In accordance
with such notice, or lurnish a substitute, or pay
three hundred dollars, he will be in law a deserter,
and must be treated accordingly.”
There Is no way or manner In which a person
once enrolled can escape his public duties, and
when dratted, whether present or absent, whether
he changes bis residence or absconds, the rights of
the United States against him are secured, and it
Is only by the performance of his duty to the coun­
try Chat he will escape liability to be treated as a
criminal. (Signed) JAS B- FUT,

Gi eat Fires in the Woods.—On Friday
lat, a fresh breeze from the north-west
brought smoke in each intensity that the
sun at tour o’clock p. tn. was completely
obscured, am! it was difficult to recognize
a person at a distance of six rods. The
air was perfectly impregnated with the
odors ot burning Tests, and so continued
until the next a rmng, when the wind
[j . was a vl]
withdrawn.
We have learned since that the woods
near the tributaries of the Red Cedar,
some ii> inner away, '-.re or. tire, and a
great destruction to th timber is taking
place. It must indeed be a terrible fire
that could fill the heavens with smoke at
a distance ot seventy-five to one hundred
miled. _ Great forests of pine and other
timber must be completely mowed to the
ground.—Eau Chire Free I'rc.
We learn from • ue or our citizens,
just returned from Ohio, who is well ac­
quainted in the locality which ho visited 
Fainesvffle and thereabouts—that he did
not find one Democrat who would v .te
for Vallandigham tor Governor. From
another source we learn that bets are of­
fering in Ohio that VallandigLam won't
carry three counties in the Btate. Chica­
go Journal.

Another Outrage on Personal Lib­
erty:.—The Eiu Claire Free Press has a
touching account of a gallant ebony col­
ored individual named Brown, in that
place who some years since wooed and
won a white maiden. Since their marriage
Othello has taken to drink, and was re­
cently arrested while amusing himself by
walloping Lis fair Dksdemona with an
ox-goad. The Free Press continnes :
The parting with his <l loved and lost”
was affecting in the extreme. Before Mr.
Brown—belter known as nigger Brown—
left his domicil, his injured but forgiving
wife took him to one corner ot the room
and pressed to his lips a farewell kiss and
a bottle of whisky, as a pledge ot con­
tinued faith and fidelity ; and he, in turn,
bid her be cheerful in her affliction.
When he was about to enter the jail he
called the attention of the jailer, and, in
a most affecting manner, spoke as follows ;
“ I claim to be a citizen of the United
States, and am brought here against my
will. Therefore’on will receive me as
your prisoner.v
We learn from his keeper that, like fhe
great Oh;o martyr, he takes his confine­
ment easy, and expects soon to Lave his
course vindicated before the people. In
fact he baa already been solicited by the
Albany meeting and the Copperhead De­
mocracy ot Ohio, to allow the use of his
name in connection with Vallandigham’s,
to complete a Presidential ticket tor that
party. The longer and closer Brown is
confined, the stronger he gets ; and as it
is behved by them that popular liberty
has received a severe blow by bis incar­
ceration, there is every reason to expect
that policy as well as principle will give
the two martyrs preference, and that
*• Traitor Vallandigham and Nigger
Brown ” will be the standard bearers of
the Copperhead Democracy in 1864.

.Richmond views of Things in General
A C harleston Estimate of 1 kings in Particular.
[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.]
Washington, July 20.—The Richmond
Enquirer ot the 15th mst., has a lung edi­
torial on the military situation, urging
that the only salvation of the Southern
Cuufede- -oy is in calling out a levy en
masse, and the application of martial law
to the whole country, which is in a state
ot siege; absolute control ot ail trading,
especially in drink, as within military
lines; abolition of substitution, exemp­
tion and foreign protection, and a material
enlargement of the President’s power to
revise election of officers, make appoint­
ments, and get rid ot incompetent officers.
A proclamation by Jeff'. Davis appears,
calling out under the Confederate Conscrip­
tion Act, all white men between the ages
of 18 and 45, to serve lor three years, un­
der penalty of being punished lor deser­
tion in case of disobeying the call. They
are offered the privilege of joining the
volunteer organizations before enrolment.
The Enquirer says an official dispatch
from Charleston, received yesterday morn­
ing, states that all was quiet. The enemy
are throwing up works on the south cor­
ner of Morris Island. Two Federal iron­
ciade entered the Appomatox river, but
the river is obstructed above, and there
were hopes by the fall of the freshet, to
catch the iron-dads aground. The Charles
ton Mercury, received in Richmond on
the 16th, Las the following on the situation
there:
44 It appears to us useless to attempt to
disguise from ourselves the situation. By
whose fault we got into it, it is in vain
now to inquire. The Yankees having got­
ten possession of the southern halt of
Morris Bland, there is but one way to
save the city of Charleston, and that is
the speedy and unflinching use of the
bayonet.
“ The fight ou Morris Island is to be
now fought by engineering and cannon
merely. The advantage is with the en­
emy, With their iron-dads on the water,
and their men in occupation of the land,
it is likely to be a mere question of time.
The fall of Fort Wagner ends in the tail
ot Charleston. Fort Sumter, like Fort
Wagner, will then be assailable by both
laud aud sea, and the fate ot Fort Pulaski
will he that ot Sumter.
“ Geu. Gilmore, the commander of this
department, is the man who reduced Fort
Pulaski.
14 Charleston must be saved a Richmond
was. For six days our forces stormed the
successive batteries of the enemy and
saved Richmond. The greater part of the
soldiers who achieved these triumphs, by
the bayonet, had never before been m a
charge. These Yankees have as yet tew
or no lormidable works; they have but a
few thousand troops. It our soldiers and
officers here are not equal to the kind ot
fighting fought by the army of Virginia,
and tried by the Yankee.! against such
strong works as Fort Wagner and Seces­
sionville, then Charleston tails. This ap­
pears to us as the only course of safety,
and we may add, too, for the economy ot
lives. Other means may protract the
fighting to days and weeks, and postpone
the termination of the straggle. No oth­
er means, in our opinion, will save the
city. W’e believe it can easily be saved,
wuh promptness, energy and dash. It is
too late for engineering. Hesitation and
delay are fatal.”

Mr:—Enclosed I send you a list of the
killed ami wounded in the engagement
near Beverly Ford, June 9th, 1883.
I was detained by sickness from par­
ticipating in ibis engagement and was
obliged to remain Behind in camp. It is
gratifying, however, to be able to report
that the bravery of the old 3d was again
severely tested, and they were not found
wanting.
In comparison to the battle of Chancel­
lorville, this engagement was a mere skir­
mish, yet, this regiment had vhe honor of
filling an important position, clearing the
way for our cavalry by skirmishing in
their front, and driving them from stone
walls, rifle pits and timber, and challeng­
ed the admiration of all by their coolness
aud their effective shots.

ot New York men with the rebels in

FROM CHARLESTON.
The Norris Island Fight—Details of the
First and Second Day’s Bombardment
—Sumter Breached and Cummiug’s
Captured and Re-Captured. ~
Boston, July 18.—The Herald's corres­
pondent gives the following account of
the second day’s fighting on Morris Island :
On the morning ot July 4tfi, the 6th
Connecticut and 9th Maine regiments
made a fnrions attack upon the Cumming’s
Point battc-y, got possession of it, and
hoisted the American flag at daylight.—
Fort Sumter opened upon them, when a
cowardly Pennsylvania regiment deserted
them, refusing to stand by their comrades.
The other regiments held the battery until
they were badly cut up, and then aban­
doned it, and the rebels again took pos­
session ot it. These two regiments have
snown themselves heroes in this campaign.
At 10 o’clock a. x. the Monitors proceeded
to attack Cummitg’s Point battery, and at
12 o’clock, three ot the wooden gunboats
opened on the battery at long range, and
threw their 200-pound shot directly int
the works.
Fort Sumter has been throwing shells
into Morris Islani, without doing any
damage to our side.
The cannonading ceased at 4P. M. The
Monitors have been supplied with fresh
crews from the different ships.
fhe iron-clad Montauk has just arrived
from Port Royal. She is over the bar,
making, with the gunboats, fourteen ves­
sels in front of Morris Island and Sumter.
We shall recommence the attack to-mor­
row morning, vhen we are sure of si­
lencing the (Jamming's Point battery and
Fort Johnson. Everything is working
well. The ball has opened in earnest.
The Memphis lias just brought in a
rebel side-wheel steamer, loaded with cot­
ton, captured while trying to run out at
Ball’s Bay, last night.
P. S.—Oar troops will have their bat­
tery done in two days more, and then they
can shell Sumter.
New York, July 18.—Advices by the
Fulton, state that the result of Gilmore’s
operations, up to the morning of the 14th
are; He has possession ol all the batte­
ries on Morris Island, save Fort Wagner.
It is reported that our ironclads hau made
a breach on the sooth wall of Sumter.
On the 13lh. 113 wounded rebels were
brought iuto Folly Island, many of them
stating that they were forced into the reb­
el service. They art Germans, and will
be sent North. Other advices by the
Fulton re merely corroborative of the
Boston Herald reporter’s account.
NewT York, July 19.—Full details of the
operations against Charleston are pub­
lished.
During the operations, a rebel steamer
attempted to land reinforcements on Mor­
ris Island, hut was driven off and destroy,
ed by our gunboats, and the troops barely
escaped. It is reported also that the
rebel gunboat venturing too near our ves­
sels was captured.
Our loss in the capture of the Morris
Island batteries, and the attempt ca Fort
Wagner, toot—7lh Connecticut, 109, a
large number of whom are missing ; 3d
New Hampshire, 8 killed and 21 wounded;
76th Pennsylvania, 149 killed, wounded
and missing; 7lh New Hampshire, 5
wounded; 6th Connecticut, 1 killed and
11 wounded; 48th New York, 4 killed
and 23 wounded; 62d Ohio, 1 wounded ;
9ch Maine, 3 killed, 85 wounded, and 20
missing.
Vicksburg, July 15.—Special to the
Chicago Journal.—Geu. Herron’s division,
with the gunboats De Kalb. Signal and
Kenvood, left, on the 11th, tor Yazoo City.
Towards the night of the 18th, the mam
body of the troops moved np the left bank
—the gunboats a little in advance. At
1,500 yards the rebel battery opened on
the DeKalb. The tire was returned. Our
troops advanced steadily, and drove the
rebels out ot the battery and rifle-pits.
They then evacuated, retreating. Mean­
while, a small infantry force on the right
bank surprised the rebel steamer Sf. Marys
opposite the city, captured her and toe
crew. So tar, all right.
In the evening the gunboats ran above
the town. The Signal discovered aud
picked up a demijohn torpedo. It soon af­
ter exploded under the Huron DeKalb.
She was rnn ashore and made fast. The
Kenwood came up, took off the officers aud
crew an! personal property, aud she went
down stern foremost. She was one of the
oldest and best boats, and cost $200,000,

Tullahoma. Tenn., July 18.—A dispatch
from Gen. Ccok, at Winchester, says that
rebel scouts from Chattanooga represent
the general belief in that place to be that
Charleston hasfallen. Influential citizens
say that the news comes from a reliable
source. A perUct gloom prevailed among
the rebel army and the populace in con­
seaneuce.
Col. Wilder’s imanted infantry has re­
turned from a hign'y successful expedition
to Columbia and Centreville. Ibe force
consisted of the 123d Illinois, Col. Monroe,
and the 17th Indians, Col. Jordon—the
whole under comtmnd of Col. Monroe.
The expedition Las Veen out six days and
brought back nearly 600 horses and moles
and 250 negroes. Eighty head of the
stock and 212 negrojs were taken from
Gen. Polk. Several skirmishes were had
in the course of the trip, resulting in the
killing of ten gnerril&s and the capture
of fl'e commissiontd officers and fifty

PrOFOUND la.NORANCE OF THE "" 1'oOR WllITE
Trash "" is the South. Capt. Randolph of the
3d (colored) South Carolina Volunteers relates a
characteristic story of a prisoner of war, exempli­
fying the sublime ignorance in which the poor,
non-ilaveholding whites of the South are steeped.
Last February, when the United States troops
penetrated to Jacksonville, Fla., some Confede­
rate soldiers were captured. A motley crew they
were, whose picturesque variety of ruggedness
bore here and there some indications of aim at
military style, but nothing of what could be called
uniform, lwo men claimed exemption from cap­
ture as being civilians. One of the two owned to
having been impressed into the Confederate
Army, but alleged that he had got his discharge
and wss a civilian. "" How long were you a sol­
dier ? "" asked Captain Randolph. "" Three years,""
replied the prisoner. ""The CoLfederato Army
has been three years in the field, eh P"" asked the
Captain. "" No,"" answered the cracker, "" but 1

Soldiers, on

Monday, January 11th, 1864.

Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Ilepre
tentative:.
Obedient to the mandate of the people, I
appear before you to-day to assume the du­
ties of Chief Magistatc of the State of Ohio.
I am not ignorant of the magnitude and im­
portance of the position, nor unmindful of
my own want of experience and ability to
so administer it, as to satisfy the expecta-
tions of tlio people who have chosen me.
Most gladly would I have seen its honors
and duties imposed upon some abler citizen
of the State; and it is with no ordinary de­
gree of diflldence that I assume to-day its
labors and responsibilities. I can only as­
sure vou,gentlemcn,and those you represent.
that I bring to this position a fixed deter­
mination to discharge its duties, to the best
of mv ability, in a spirit of unyielding
laitniuiness anu integrity to tne state,
and impartiality and justice to the peo­
ple.. There is a significance in the recent ex­
pression of the' popular will that relieves us
all from many of the embarrassment that
usually attend such events. It heralds no
mere party triumph it is no individual suc­
cess. No mere partisan effort could have
achieved such a victory; no man in the
State is worthy of. or could have received,
so sublime au ""ovation. It is a spontaneous
declaration of the intense loyalty of our
people to their government, and bearing it
with the stern commandment that every
energy of their State, and every exertion of
its rulers, snail do given to tne restoration
of that government to its original unity and
power. It not only relieves us of all mere
partisan trammels and alllnities, but it com­
mands us that, for the time being, these shall
be laid aside, until the great purpose is ac­
complished of restoring our country to a
position in which partisan contests may be
indulged without involving our nationality;
and party victories be won without their
possible results giving encouragement to
rebels in arms against the supremacy of the
Constitution and laws of tlie land.. In that
spirit I accept tlio late declaration of our
common constituency; and humbly thank
them that, in this particular, they have
made my path easy and straight before
me.
While this national obligation is laid up­
, on us, it does not relieve us from the fur­
ther duty of guarding the local interests,
and promoting the prosperity of our own
State. This duty, to a large extent, dc­
.volves upon the legislative body. I fully
share in the confidence of the people who
have called you from your respective avo­
cations in fife, and committed to you, for
the time being, the honor, the credit, and
the prosperity of the State. In all that I
can, and properly may do, it will give me
great pleasure to co-operate with you in
the accomplishment of this great purpose,
r The annual message of my worthy pre­
decessor, with the accompanying docu­
ments, presents you, in a concise and intel­
ligible manner, the condition of our State
affairs. His recommendations are worthy
of, and will undoubtedly receive, your care­
ful consideration. His arduous labors have

gratifying results presented to you; ana u
is a pleasing reflection that the people of i
the State will be able to follow him into his
present retirement from executive duties,
with the grateful plaudit of ""well done
good and faithful servant."" It will be an
abiding pleasure to me, if, at the end of my
own brief service, I shall be able to attain
alike his Usefulness and his reward.
It is not less gratifying than honorable to
the State that we have T)een able to pass
through tho third year of an expensive and
sanguinary war, in tho full performance of
all our amies 10 me iauonai viovernmeni,
without impairing, in any manner, the
prosperity of the State, or oppressing our
peoplo by burthensome or excessive taxa­
tion.The flnoncial condition of the State is
highly satisfactory. The currency is In a!
soq lid condition. The agricultural, indus­
trial and commercial interests of the State
were never more prosperous. The State has
been protected, with a single exception,
from invasion, and the desolating ravages
of war have not spread themselves within
our limits. At the same time the great in­
stitutions of education and benevolence,
wltich constitute a material clemeat of our
pride and strength, have not been en­
. croached upon or impaired. Our schools
and colleges our seminaries of learning
our arts and sciences! our noble institutions","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84028645/1864-01-12/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,ohi_lysander_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Daily Ohio statesman.,S.

TO THE SUPPORTERS OF TIE 00 VFRN11ENT:

We have read with surprise, but not
without Indignation, the Proclamation of
the President Of the 8th of July, 1864.
The supporters of the Administration are
responsible to the country for its conduct:
ana it is their right and duty to check the
encroachments of the Executive on the au­
thority of Congress, and to require it to
confine itself to its proper sphere.
It is impossible to pass in silence this
Proclamation without neglecting that duty;
and, having taken as much responsibility
as any others in supporting th Adminis­
tration, we are not disposed to fail in the
other duty of asserting the rights of Con­
gress.The President did not sign the bill ""to
guarantee to certain States, whose Govern­
ments have been usurped, a republican form
of government"" passed by the supporters
of his Administration in both Houses ol
Congress after mature deliberation.
The bill did not therefore become a lavx
and it is therefore nothing.
The Proclamation is neither an approval
nor a veto of the bill; it is therefore a docu­
ment unknown to the laws and Constitution
of the United States.
So far as It contains an apology for not
signing the bill, It is a political manifesto
against the friends of the Government.
So- far as it proposes to execute the bill,
which is not a law, it is a grave Executive
usurpation.
It Is fitting that the facts necessary to en­
able the friends of the Administration to
appreciate the apology and the usurpation
be spread before them.
The Proclamation says:
""And whereas the said bill was presented
to the President of the United States for
his approval less than one hour before the
eiiie die adjournment of said session, and
was not signed by him""
If that be accurate, still this bill was pre­
sented with other bills which were signed.
Within that hour, the time for the sine rfi'e
adjournment was three times postponed by
the votes of both Houses; and the least in­
timation of a desire for more time by the
President to consider this bill would have
secured a further postponement.
Yet the committee sent to ascertain if the
President had any further communication
for the House of llepresentatives reported
that he had none; and the friends of the
bill, who had anxiously waited on him to
ascertain its fate, had already been inform­
ed that the President had resolved not to
sign it.
The time of presentation, therefore, had
nothing to do with his failure to approve it.
The bill had been discussed and consider
ed for more than a month in the House of
llepresentatives, which it passed on the 4th
of May; it was reported to the Senate on
the 27th of May without material amend­
ment, and passed the Senate absolutely as
it came from the House on the 2d of July.
Ignorance of iA contents is out of the
question.
Indeed, at his request, a draft of a bill
substantially the same in all material points,
and identical in tbe points objected to by the
Proclamation, had been Aid before him for
his consideration In the winter of 18C2-C3.
There is, therefore, ho re:Mn to suppose
the provisions of the bill took the President
by surprise.
On the contrary, we have reason to bcl Icve
them to have been so well known that this
method of preventing the bill from be­
coming a law without the constitutional
responsibility of a veto, had been resolved
on long before the bill passed the Senate.
; We are Informed by a gentleman entitled
to entire confidence, that before the 22d of
June in New Orleans it was stated by
a member of Gen. Banks's staff, in tho
presence of otlier gentlemen in otnclal
position, that Senator Doolittle had written
a letter to the department that tha House
Iteconstruetionbill would be staved off in
the Senate to a period too late in the session
to require the President to veto it in erder
to defeat it. and that Mr.1 Lincoln would
retain the bill, If necessary, and thereby
defeat it. ""'. ' - . 1 '
.The experience of Senator Wade, in his
various efforts to get the bill considered in
the Senate, was quite in accordance with
that plan: and the fate of the bill was
accurately predicted :' by letters received
from New Orleans before it had passed the
Senates ."" "" "". ' ""' '"" -'
. Had the Proclamation stormed there, it
would have been only one other defeat of
the will of the people by an Executive
perversion of the Constitution
! But it goes further. The President says:
""And whereas the said bill contains, arnone
other things, a pian ior restoring tne Mates
in reDeiuon to tneir proper practical rela­
tion in the Union, which plan expresses the
sense of Congress upou that subject, and
which plan it is now thought fit to lay be­
fore the people for their consideration""
By what authority of the Constitution?
In what forms? The result to be declared
by whom? , With what effect when ascer­
.tained?, ,
Is it to be a law by the approval of the
people without the approval of Congress at
tbe wm 01 tne rresmenir
t Will the President on. his opinion of the
popular approval, execute it as a law?
Or is this merely a device to avoid: the
serious responsibility of defeating a law on
which so many loyal hearts reposed lor se­
curity? .
But the reasons now assigned for not ap­
proving the bill are full of ominous slguiil­
cance. ,.. .;i . . ,r. . '. ,
; The President proceeds: . ,.
""Vow. therefore. I. Abraham Lincoln.
President of the United States, do proclaim,
declare ana niaKO Known, mat, wnue 1 am
fns I was In December last, when bv nroc-
laraatlon I propounded a plan for restora­
tion) unprepared, by a formal approval of
this bill, to be inflexibly committed to auy
single plan of restoration""
i That Is to My, the President is resolved
that the pepple shall hot ly law take, any se­
curities from the rebel- States against a re­
newftl of thB Trellion,' (before restoring
their power to govern ub. . . , ,.
His wisdom and prudence are to be our
sunlctint guarantees! 3 1 s : i :.:; :

formally declared should not be recognized
whose Kenresentatlves and Senators were
repelled by formal votes of both Houses of
congress w men it was tieciareu iorniany
should have no electoral vote for President
and Vice President. .
They are the mere creatures of his will.
They cannot live a day without his support.
They are mere oligarchies, imposed on the
people by military orders under the forms
of election, at which generals, provost­
marshals, soldiers and camp-followers were
the chief actors, assisted by a handful of
resident citizens, and urged on to prema­
ture action by private letters from the
President.
, In neither Louisiana nor Arkansas, bo­
fore Banks's defeat, did the United States
control half the territory or half the popu­
lation. In Louisiana, Gen. Bank's procla­
mation candidly declared : ""The fundamen­
tal law of the State is martial lawJ""
On that foundation of freedom, he erect­
ed what the President calls ""the freeConsti­
tutlon and Government of Louisiana.""
But of this State, whose fundamental law
was martial law, only sixteen parishes out
of forty-eight parishes were neld by the
United States; and in five of the sixteen we
held only our camps.
The eleven parishes we substantially held
had 233,185 inhabitants; the residue of the
State not held by us, 675,617.
At the farce called an election, the officers
of Gen. Banks returned that 11,346 ballots
were cast, but whether any or by whom the
people of the United States have no legal
assurance: but it is probable that 4,000 were
cast by soldiers or employees of the United
States military or municipal, but noneaccording-
to any law, State or National, and
7,000 ballots represent the State of Louisi­
ana. '
Such Is the free Constitution and Govern­
ment of Louisiana; and like it is that of Ar­
kansas. Nothing but the failure of a mili­
tary expedition deprived us of alike one in
the swamps of Florida; and before the
Presidential election, like ones may be or­
ganized in every rebel State where the Uni­
ted States have a camp.
The President, by preventing this bill
from becoming a law, holds the electoral
votes of the rebel States at tho dictation of
his personal ambition.
! If those votes turn the balance In his fa­
vor, is it to be supposed that his competitor,
defeated by such means, will acquiesce?
It the rebel majority assert their suprem­
acy in those States, and send votes which
elect an enemy of the Government, will we
not repel his claims?
Ana is not that civil war for the Presi­
dency, Inaugurated by the votes of rebel
States?
Seriously impressed with these dangers,
Congress, "":? proper constitutional authority""
formally declared that there are no State
Governments in the rebel States, and pro­
vided for their erection at the proper tune;
and both the Senate and the House of l'ep­
resentatlve3 rejected the Senators and Rep­
resentatives chosen under authority of what
the President calls the Free Constitution
and Government of Arkansas.
The President's Proclamation ""holds for
nawjht"" this judgment, and discards the au­
thority of the Supreme Court, and strides
headlong toward the anarchy his Proc­
lamation of the 8th of December Inaug­
urated. -
If electors for President be allowed to be
chosen in either of those States, a sinister
light will be cast on the motives which in­
duced the President to ""hold for naught""
the will of Congress rather than his Gov­
ernment in Louisiana and Arkansas,
That judgment of Congress which the
President defies was the exercise of an au­
thority exclusively vested In Congress by
the Constitution to determine what is the
established Government in a State, and in
its own nature and by the highest judicial
authority binding on all other departments
of the Government.
The Supreme Court has formally declared
that under tho 4th section of the IVth arti­
cle of the Constitution, requiring the United
States to guarantee to every State a repub­
lican form of government, ""it rests with
Congress to dctide what (-fovernment is the
established one in a State;"" and ""teien Sen­
ators and Representatives of a State are ad­
mitted into the councils of the Union, the
authority ot the.Government wuler which they
are appointed, as well as its republican char­
acter, is recognized by the proper constitutional
authority, and its decision is binding on event
other department of the Government, and could
not be questioned in a judicial ti ibunal. It
is true that the contest in this case did not
last long enough to bring the matter to this
issue; and, as no Senators or Itepre; ita­
tlves were elected under the authoiityof
the Government of which Mr. Dorr was the
head, Congress was not called upon to de­
cide the controversy. Yet tho right to de
clde is placed iier."" '
Even the President's proclamation of the
8th of December, formally declares that
'Whether members sent to Congress from
any State shall be admitted to sents, consti­
tutionally rests exclusively with the tcsj
pective Houses, and not to any extent with
the Executive."" : '
And that is not the less true because
wholly inconsistent with tha President's
assumption In that proclamation of a right
to institute ana recognize istate uovern­
ments in the rebel States, nor because the
President is unable ta percelvo that his
recognition is a nullity If it be not con
, elusive on Coneress.
' . Under the Constitution, the right to Sen­
ators and Representatives is inseparable
from a state Government. ""!. .
If there be a State Government, the right
Is absolute. ' - - :
If there be no State Government, there
can be no senators or ltepresentatives cho­
sen. ': "" !.-'. -i!'.
The two Houses of Congress are express­
ly declared to be the solo ludges of their
own members.'
: 1 When, therefore, Senators and Repre­
sentatives are admitted, the State Govern­
ment, under whose authority they were
chosen, is conclusively established: when
they are rejected, its existence Is as con
clusively rejected anrt denied; and to this
Judgment the President is bound to sub­
mit. .' : . - N'.-; :. - ' : ,.,! - -
The President proceeds to express his
unwillingness ""to declare a constitutional
competency in Congress to abolish slavery
in States"" as another reason for not signing
the bill. , - , 1 : , . t
But the bill nowhere proposes to abolish
Slavery in States. .
The bill did provide that all slaves in the
rebel States should manumitted.
' But as the President had already signed
three, bills manumitting several classes of
slaves trt States, ft Is not conceived possible
that he entertained any scruples touching
that provision of the bill respecting which
helssilent.' 't 1 u -
! He had already himself assumed !a right
by proclamation to, free much the larger
number of slaves in the rebel States, under
the authority given him by Congress to use
military power to suppress the Rebellion;
and it is qnlte Inconceivable that the Pres­
ident 'should think Congress could vest In
htm a discretion it 'could not1 exercise it­
:8elf.""' -11 ''' 1 1 ; '''' : ' ' ! 1 ;-
It ia the more unintelligible from the fact
that except' in respect , to a small part of
Virginia and Louisiana, the bill covered
lonly what the proclamation covered--added
1 a Congressional title and Judicial remedies
by law to the disputed title under the proc
lamation, and perfected the work the pres­
ident' professed to be bo anxious, toiccom-pllsh.

! Slavery as au institution can be abollshed-j
only uv a cnange or tne uonsiuunon 01 tue
United States or of the law of the State; and
this is the principle ot the bill. ; ; .
: It required the new Constitution of the
State to provide for that prohibition; and
the President, in the face of his own proc­
lamation, dees not venture to object to in­
sisting on that condition. Xor will the
country tolerate its abandonment yet he
defeated the only provision Imposing It ! !
But when 'oe describes himself, In splteof
this great blow at emancipation, as ""sin­
cerely hoping and expecting that a consti­
tutional amendment abolishing slavery
throughout the nation, may be adopted,""
we curiously inquire on what his expecta­
tion rests, after the vote of the House of
Representatives at tho recent session, and
in the face of the political complexion of
more than enough of the States to prevent
the possibility of its adoption within any
reasonable time; and why he did not in­
dulge his sincere hopes with so large an in­
stallment of the blessing as his approval ot
the bill would have secured.
After this assignment of his reasons for
preventing the bill from becoming a law,
the President proceeds to declare his pur­
pose to execute it as a law by his plenary dicta­
torial power, .
He says: ' .
"".Nevertheless, I am fully satisfied with
the system for restoration contained in the
bill as one very proper plan for the loyal
people of any State choosing to adopt it;
and that I am, and at all times shall be, pro­
pared to give the Executive aid and assist­
ance to any such people so soon as the mil­
itary resistance to the United States shall
have been suppressed In any such State,
nnd the people thereof shall have sulBcient­
ly returned to their obedience to the Con­
stitution and the laws of the United States;
in which' cases Military Governors will be
appointed, with directions to proceed ac­
cording to the bill.""
A more studied outrage on the legislative
authority of the people lias never been per­
petrated.(ingress passed a bill; the President re­
fused to approve it, and then by proclama­
tion puts as much of it in force as he sees
fit, and proposes to execute those parts by
officers unknown to the laws of the United
States nnd not subject to the confirmation
of the Senate 1
The bill directed the appointment of Pro­
visional Governors by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate.
Tho President, after defeating the law,
proposes to appoint without law, and with­
out the advice and consent ot the Senate,
Military Governors for the rebel States !
He has already exercised this dictatorial
usurpation in Louisiana, and lie aeieaceu
the bill to prevent its limitation.
Henceforth we must regard the following
precedent as tho Presidential law of the
Rebel States:

""EXECUTIVE MANSION,

""EXECUTIVE MANSION,""WASHINGTON, March 15, 1864.

""His Excellency Micliael Hahn,

Governor of Louisiana:

""Until further orders, you are hereby in­
vested with the powers exercised hitherto
.by the Military Governor-of Louisiana.

""ABRAHAM LINCOLN.""

This Michael Hahn is no officer of the
United States; tho President, without law,
without the advice and consent of the
Seuate, by a private note not even counter­
signed by the Secretary of State, makes him
Dictator of Louisiana 1 '
Tho bill provided for the civil adminis
tration of the laws of the State till it
should be in a fit temper to. govern itself
repealing all laws recognizing Slavery, ana
makinz all men euual before the law.
- These beneficent provisions the President
has auuulled. People will (he, anu marry
and transfer property, and buy and sell: and
to these acts of civil life courts and officers
of the law are necessary. Consrress legisla
ted for these necessary things, and the Pres
ident deprives tueru 01 tne protection 01 the
law!
The President's purpose to instruct his
Military Governors ""to proceed according
to the bill a uiakeslnit to calm the disap­
pointment its defeat has occasioned is not
merely a grave usurpation but a transpar­
ent delusion.
He cannot ""proceed according to the bill""
after preventing it from becoming a law.
Whatever is done will be at his will and
pleasure, by persons responsible to no law,
and more Interested to secure the interests
and execute the will of the President than
of the people; and the will of Congress is
to be ""held for naught"", ""uuless the loyal
people of the rebel States choose to adopt
It."" ' ;', . i .
: If they should graciously prefer the strin
gent bill to the easy proclamation, still the
registration will be made, under no legal
sanction; it will give no assurance that a nia­
ority of the people of the States have taken
the oath: if administered,- it will be with­
out legal authority, .nd void; no indict­
ment will lie for. false swearing at the elec­
tion, or for ailmittingbad or rejecting good
votes; it will be the farce of Louisiana and
Arkansas acted over again, under the forms
of this bill, but not by authority of law.
But when we como to the guarantees of
future peace which Congress meant to
enact, the forms, as well as the substance of
the bill, must yield, to the President's will
that none should be imposed, r.
It was tho solemn resolve of Congress to
protect the loyal men of the' nation against
three great dangers, (1) the return to pow­
er of the. guilty leaders ,of the rebellion,
(2) the continuance of slavery, and (3 the
burden of the rebel debt. ' -
Congress required assent to those provis­
ions by the Convention of the State; and If
refused, it was to be dissolved. ., j .
; The President ""Holds lor naught"" that
, "" , r.
resolve 01 tjongress, Because neis unwilling
""to be inflexibly committed to any one plan
of restoration,"" and the-people of the Unit­
ed States are not to be allowed to protect
themselves unless their enemies agree to it.
The order to proceed according to the bill
is therefore merely at the will of the rebel
States; and they have the option to reject it,
accept the proclamation of the 8th of De­
cember, and demand the president's recog­
nition! ,. . . . .,' ' .'. . ; ;
1 Mark-the contrast! The bill requires a
majority, the proclamation is satisfied with
one-tenth; the bill, requires one oath, the
proclamation another; the bill ascertains
voters by registering; the proclamatlbn by
guess; the bill exacts adherenqe to existing
territorial limits, the proclamation admits
of others; the bill governs the rebel States
by law, equalizing all before it, the uroela-'
motions commits them to the lawless dia
oretion of military Governors and Pro vostr
juarsuais; tne dui loroias electors ior iTes­

Constitution, to add a State guaranty to the
proclamation title; and the right of a slave
to freedom is an open question before the
State courts on the relative authority of the
State law and the Proclamation. -. - ..

No habeas corpus lies forhlin In a United

Such arc the fruits of this rash and fatal
act of the President a blow at the friends
of, his Administration, at the rights of t
humanity, and at tho principles of republican
governmeut.
The President has greatly presumed on
the forbearance which the supporters of his 1
Admin iotration have so long practiced, in ,
view of the arduous conflict in which we
are engaged, and the reckless ferocity of our
political opponents. ' '"";
Buthe must understand that our sup- . i

authority of Congress is paramount and
must be respected; that the whole body of '
the Union men of Congress will not submit-to

support, he must confine himself to his ex­
ecutive duties to obey and execute, not 0
make the laws to suppress by arms armed ' '
Rebellion, and leave political reorgauiza- j

It the supporters of the Government fall
to insist on this, they become responsible '
for the usurpations which they fail tore­

In the receut elect iou in Australia many
of the voters were naturalized Chinese,
who, being free from political prejudices,
sold their votes to the highest bidder. ?
In one town about thirty of them were
bought at eight shillings each, and tu­
tored to answer ""yes"" to every question
asked them at the polls. The opposite
party had a bint of this, however, and
the tirst question proposed was, ""Have
you voted before at this eloctiou?"" An
affirmative answer sec n red for the would­
be voter an unceremonious packiug off.
Two or three who got through this or­
deal had beeu iustructed to scratch the
tirst throe names on the priuted ballot.
Like genuine Chinamen as they were
they took the paper upside down, and
erased the very names they were paid to
vote for.

to confer informally with any official agents that
might he seat by tne with a view to the restoration of
roe. I requested the Han. A. H. Stephens, Hon. R M.
Hunter and Hon. John A. Campbell to proceed
through our lines and hold conference with Lincoln, or
such persons as he might depute to represent him.
I herewith submit for the Information of Congress the
report of these eminent citisens above named, showing
that the enemy refused to enter Into negotiations with
the Confederate States or any them separately, or hive
our people any other terms or guarantees than those
which Congress may grant, or to permit us to have
a vote on any other basis than our unconditional
submission to their rule, coupled with the acceptance of
their recent legtalatlon, Including the amendment to the
constitution emancipating all negro slaves; and with the
right on the part of federal Cotfe/rees to legislate on the
subject of the relations between the white and black
populations In each State. Such Is, as I understand, the
effect of the amendment to the constitution which has
been adopted by the Congiass of the United States
JEFFERSON DAVIS.
, This was close It followed by maw meetings In the
j oapltal and elsewhere.
How strange It is that all these bloody-minded men,
Who advocated the black flag and no quarters upon
our street corners, contented themselves with words;
and with nil this hate of Yankees never undertook to
find them at the front, where there have been lots Of
them to he found fbr {our yean.
Mr, D. said in one of those Richmond'meetlngs in his
peoch, ""We will teach them that when they talk to ns
they talk to their masters.""
Mr. Stephens came home with but a new cause of sorrow,
and those who said he talked of coming homo to
make war speeches and denounca the terms offered
Imply Had. Before Mr. Ltncoln'3 death he thought he
waa doing a favor to him not to include that offer of four
hundred millions In gold for the Southern slaves in the
Sublimed report, for it would be used to tbo Injury of
ir. Lincoln by those of his enemies who would talk
about taxation and the debt.
Mr. Stephens has frequently expressed no apprehensions,
should tho fortunes of war throw him into the
hands of Mr. Lincoln, and said he would not get out of
the way of a raid were It not for appearances, on account
of tfce office he held. He spoke of Mr. Lincoln as an old
fHend. who had generally voted with him in Congress,
and who had a good heart and fine mind, and waa undoubtedly
honest
This much we have written, In vindication of our assertion
when tho terms were offered, that they ""were
not dishonorable."" We so remarked at the lime the
conference ended, and for so doing was scoffed at and
reviled by the administration press of the South, who
endeavored to excite the public against us by raising the
mad dog cries of ""reoonstructlonlst,"" ""enemy to the
Southern cause,"" Ac.
We have also felt It a duty to give Mr. Stephens' statement

Three children of Jeti: Davis arrived here tlds morning
on tlie St. John, stopped at the Dulavan Hou?e for s
few botin. and left on the Rensselaer and Saratoga railroad
for Montreal. There were two sons sud u daughter,

William They were accompanied by the mother of
Mrs. Davis, a white servant girl, and a man servant. A
larfffi crowd aitrvi-ftjwl in th? fWtUvan Wimtn wkaM

quite a disgusting scene took placo. A number of wom<'ti
went In, and. amid tbe moot OtdnfM profession*

nothing in them nor their parent* that entitle tbetn to

should be put away, and that in time of rebellion
there was no Constitution. But it is
now enfolding: it must now I* read and adjusted
and understood by the American ptopie.
I come here to-day to vindicate, in so far as
I can in these remarks, the Constitution: to
save it, as I believe, for it does seem that encroachment
after encroachment is to be pressed:
and at 1 resist encroachments on the Government,
I stand to-day prepared to resist encroachment*
on the Constitution, and thereby
preserve the Government. It is now peace,
and let us have peace. Let ug enforce the Constitution.
Let us live under and by its provisions.
I.et it be published in blazoned characters,
as though it were in the heavens, so that
all may read and all may understand it. Let
us consult that instrument, and, understanding
its principles, let us appl* them. 1 tell the

u(>(>uucuu 01 mis uoTernineui, ana x care not
from what qnarter they come, East or West,
North or South, ""you that ar? engaged in the
work of breaking up this Government are mistaken.
Tbe ConBtitation and the principles of
free government are deeply rooted in the American
heart."" A II the powers combined: I care
not of what character they are, cannot destroy
the image of Freedom. They may
succeed for a time, but their attempts
will b? futile. They may as well
attempt to lock up the winds or cha-.n tbe
waves. Yes, they may as well attempt to repeal;
it, (as it would seem the Constitution can
be,) by a concurrent resolution: but when it is
submitted to the popular judgment, they will
find it just as well to introduce a resolution repealing
tbe law of gravitation: and tbe idea of
preventing the restoration of the Union is about
as feasible as resistance to the great law of gravity
which binds all to a great common center.
This great law ol gravitation wiLl bring back
those States to harmony and their relations to
the Federal Government, and all machinations
North and South canaot prevent it. [Cheers.J
All that is wanting is time, until tbe American
people can understand what is going on, and
be ready to accept tbe view just as it appears
to'me. I would to God that the whole American
people could be assembled here to-day as
you are. I could wish to have an amphitheater
large enough to contain the whole thirty
millions; that they could be bere and witness
tbe great struggle to preserve tbe Constitution
of our fathers. They could at once see what it

submitttd for adoption to tho Southern Legisla­
tures, to pave the wav for the submission ot the
question by the President in his message to the
Fortieth Congress.

These resolutions were sent to the Governors
of several of the Southern States to-day, accom­
panied by an advisory lettei, stating that they
met the Prtsident's approval. Tbe question of
Amnesty does not appear to have been an essen­
tial feature of the proposed plan. The Gover­
nor of North Cnrolina w as telegraphed to-night
to keep the Legislature in session to consider
these prepositions, and similar messages were
sent to the Executives of Alabama, Georgia,
and Mississippi.
Governor Orr, of South Carolina, left to-night
to submit the new plan to the Legislature of
his own State. Mew YorV Wo","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025925/1867-02-04/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,pst_ewing_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The evening telegraph.,J.

irresponsible agents sent among them for that purpose?
those are powers not k rail ted to the federal govern­
ment or to any one of Its franchises. Not being
granted, we violate our trust by aasurlng them as pal­
pably as we wouM by acting in the face of a positive
interdict; for the constitution forbids us to do wnatever
it does not affirmatively authorise, either by express
words or by clear implication. If the authority we de­
sire to uss does not come to us through the constitution
we can exercise it only by tho assumption of usurpation,
which is the moat dangerous of political crimes. By
that crime enemies of free governmenta In all ages havo
worked out their designs against public liberty and pri­
vate rights. It leads directly and immediately to tho
establishment of sbsolute rule; for undelegated power
la always unlimited and unrestrained.
Tbe acts of Congress in question are not only objec­
tionable lor their assumption of ungranted power, but
many of their provisions are tn conflict with tbe direct
prohibitions of,thefconstitution. The constitution com­
mands that s republican form of government shall be
guaranteed to all the Stales; that no person shall be
deprived of life, liberty or property without due pro­
cess of law, or arrested without a judicial
warrant, or pun'shed without a fslr trial before
an impartial jury, that tho privilege of the
habeas corpu9 shall not be dented la time
of peace aud that no bill of attainder shall be
passed against a single individual; yet the system of
measures established by these ?ta of Congress does
totally subvert and destroy the form as well as the sub­
stance of republican government in ten States to which
they apply. It binds them, hand and foot In absolute
slavery, and subjects them to a strange and hoetiie
power, more unlimited and more likely to be abused
than any other now known among civilised men. It
tramples down all those rights in which tbe essence of
liberty consists, and which a free govern­
ment Is always moat careful to protect.
It dontos the habeas corpus and trial by Jury; personal
freodom. property and life, if assailed by passion, pre­
udice or rapacity of a ruler, havo no security whatever,
i has the effect of a bill of attainder or a bill of pains and
penalties, not upon a few individuals, bnt upon the
whole inaaaes, Including millions who inhabit the sub­
jected 8 tales, aud even their unbdfn children. These
wrongs, being expressly forbidden, cannot be 'constitu­
tionally inflicted upon any portion of our people, no
matter how they may have come within our jurisdiction
and no matter whether they live in SUtas. territories or

fore relieved from the consideration of thi-difficult
and perplexing subject.
Internal improvements made by State
authority, so essential to growth and pros

longer require much consideration by th-General
Assembly. Works of a magn'itud
too great to be undertaken by iudividua-""

The part which patriotism required Ohi
to take in the war to suppress the rebellion . ""
demanded important and frequent acts i :
legislation. Fortunately the transaction
of the State growing out of the war hav Y
been.or probably cau be, closed under ex '
istinir laws, with very little, if any, addi i
tional legislation.. "" . .' ...
If not mistaken as to the result of thi t
brief reference to a few of the principal;
subjects of the legislation of the past, tin
present General Assembly has probably
better opportunity than any of its prede-
cessors to avoid the evil ot too much legist
iation. .Excessive legislation has become
a great evil, and I submit to the judgment)
of the General Assembly the wisdom ofj
avoiding it. "" 1
One important question of principle, asj
old as our State Government, still remains
unsettled. All are familiar with the con-'
flicts to which tbe policy of making dis
tinctions between citizens in civil and Do-
litical rights has given rise in Ohio. The
first effort of those who opposed this poli­
cy was to secure to all citizens equality of
civil rights. , The re$ultof the struggle
that ensued is thus given, by an,' eminent,
and honored citizen of our State:
"" The laws which created disabilities on;
the part of negroes in respect of civil rights; '
were repealed in the year 1849, after an ob­
stinate contest quite memorable iu the his­
tory of the State. Their repeal was looked '
upon with gn at disfavor by ar large por-,
tion of the people, as a dangerous innova­
tion upon a just and well-settled policy,'
and a vote In that direction consigned many .
members of the Legislature -to the repose
of private lite.. But I am not aware that
any evil results justified these apprehen­
sions, or that any effort was ever made to
impose the disabilities. . On the contrary,
the new policy, if I may call it so, has been
found so consistent with justice to the ne7
groesV and the interests ot the whites, that
no one certainly no party in Ohio, would
be willing to abandon it.""
An effort to secure to all citizens equal
political risrhts, was made in the State Con­
stitutional Convention ot 1851. Only thir­
teen, out of one hundred and eight mem­
bers in that b jdy, voted in its favor; and it
is probable that, less than one-tenth of the
voters of the State would then have voted
to strike tbe word ""white"" out ot the Con­
stitution. .
The last General Assembly submitted to
the people a proposition to amend the State
Constitution so as to abolish distinctions in
political rights based upon color. The
proposition contained several clauses not
pertinent to its main purpose, under which,
if adopted,, it was oelieved by many that
the number of white citizens who would be .
disfranchised would be much greater than
the number of colored citizens who would
be allowed the right of suffrage. Notwith­
standing the proposition was' thus ham­
pered, it receivtd 216 937-votes, or nearly
forty-five per ent. of all the votes cast in '
the State.. This result shows great pro­
gress in public sentiment since the adop­
tion of the Constitution of 1S51, and inspires
tbe friends of equal political rights with a
confident hope that in 1871, when the op-; :
po'rtnnity is given to the people, by the
provisions of the Constitution, to call a
Constitutional Convention, the organic law
of the State will be so amended as to secure
in Ohio to all the governed an equal voice
in the Government.
. But whatever reasonable doubts may be
entertained as to the probable action of the
people of Ohio on the question of an exten­
sion of the right of suffrage when a. new'.
State Constitution-shall be formed, I sub­
mit with confidence that nothing has oc­
curred which warrants the opinion that the '
ratification by the last General Assembly
of the Fourteenth Amendment to the.
Constitution of the United States, was
not in - accordance - with the deliber­
ate and settled convictions of the people:
That amendment was, after the amplest
discussion, upon an isue distinctly pre­
sented, sanctioned by a large majority of
the people. It any fact exists which justi­
fies the belief that they now wish that the.
resolution should be repealed, by which
the assent of Ohio was given to that ira;
portant . amendment, it - has not been
brought to the attention"" of the public.
Omitting all -reference to other valuable
provisions, it may be safely said that the
section whicli secures among all the States.,
ot the Union equal representation In the
House of Representatives and in the
Electoral Colleges in proportion to the ,vp­
ting population is deeine.i of vital impor­
tance by the people of Ohio. Without now
raising the grave question as to- the right
of a tate to withdraw its assent, which
has been constitutionally given to a pro-,
posed amendment of the Federal Constitu­
tion, 1 respectlully suggest that the at­
tempt which is now making to withdraw
the assent of Ohio to the Fourteenth
Amendment to"" the Federal Constitution
be postponed until the people shall
again have an opportunity to give expres­
sion to their will. , In my judgment, Ohio
will never consent that the whites ot- the
South, a - large -majority of whom were
lately in rebellion, shall exercise in the
government of the, Nation as much politi­
cal power, man for man, as the same num-
ber of white citizens of Ohio, and be al- '
lowed in addition thereto, thirty members
of Congress and of the Electoral Colleges
for colored people deprived pi every polit­
ical privilege.
In conclusion, I am happy to be able to
adopt as my own the sentiments so fitly ex­
pressed by the Speaker of the House of-Representatives
of the present .General.
Assembly. 1 sincerely hope that tbe leg­
islation of the General Assembly, and the
administration of the State Government in .
all its brauehes, may be characterized by
economy, wisdom and prudence. that
statesmanship, patriotism and philanthro-.
py may be manifest in every act, and that
all may be done under the guidance of that
Providence which has hitherto so signal! v
preserved and blest our State and Nation.

What Railroads Do for Farmers.
I
The following extract from the Agriculturist '
of this month, should be read by all our
rarmers and land owuers in this region. It
shows conclusively the great advantage of a
Railroad to an agricultural district. Those
w ho complain that they are not able to subscribe
for stock to a Railroad should bear in mind
the benefit a road would be to them. They
had better sell a portion of their land, and
invest the proceeds in Railroad stock, sooner
than do without it. [Ed. Piomeeb
“To haul 40 bushels of oorn 50 miles on a
wagon would cost at least $12 for team, driver
and expenses. A Railroad would transport it for
$4 at most. Allowing an average of 40
bushels an acre, the crop would be worth $8
pore per acre, or 8 per cent, on $100. As
the relntivo advantage is about the same for
other crops, it is clear that a Railroad pass­
ing through a town would add $110 per aero
to the value of the farms. A town of 10 miles
square contains 64,000 acres.

A gentleman under forty years of age, and a
patient of mine, who had been in the habit
of using tobacco to excess for many years,
and who had been for the last five or six
years both bald headed and gray headed,
found it necessary a few months ago to quit
the use of tobacco entirely. It was. of course,
a hard struggle at first; for it makes no dif­
ference how firm a man may he, if he once
becomes a slave tn tobacco, whisky, or opium,
it is hard, very hard work for him to recover
his liberty, to be able to say, “ I have con­
quered ;’f and very few succeed in doing it.
Ilovvever, he did it, and since that time he
has become a changed man in more than one
respect. In the first place, he has entirely
recovered his health, which was bad when
he used tobacco ; he also has recovered en­
tirely from his baldness, bis “ grog-locks""
have been replaced by an unusually luxuriant
growth of natural hair, of as fine a black hue
as one could wish to see ; he has also lost
that sallow, bees-wax hue of skin and sickly
paleness of color which “ slaves to the weed’’
so generaly have. All of this might be ex­
pected as a very natural result, except the
growth ol hair and its change of color, which,
in this case at least, has nccured as one of
the results of leaving off a noxious habit.—
The question now occurs. Is this the cause

; Yesterday a strange and terriblo natu
raLphenoinenon occurred In Choatham
countyr about nineteen miles from the
city;, on the line of the-2STashviIlo,and
orthWe9ternRitrftdfAbotria,cIoc-,
'while the men employed on the planta
tion or Joshua i-ulgbsm were going into
a field to pluck fodUtT, the nn being
hidden behind clouds at the time, and a
general gloom pervading the sky, they
were much frightened and confused by
the apparent opening of the cloud?,
Judging from the description of the phe­
mini on on, not more than five or six de­
grees north of the zenith. They Judge
the cloud to be about three-quarters of
n mile high. The strange sight attracted
their nouue.: A brilliant whitish
reu
3 of
.glare, overspread an Immense masa
black clouds, in the center of which an
peared a funnel-llko aperture about four
or iivo feet in diameter, tho eidot of
which presented the appearance of
ragged flames darting like liery tongue?,
and licking and lapping at a largo white
hot object passing with inconceivable
raniditv down through the aperture.
When it left the mass of cloud it did not
anr.Rnr Io fall in a cernendicular direc-
wtiun, but sloped'atan inclination of some
ten or fifteen decrees from a nlumb linn.
fand grew more'intensely bright as It ap
proacbeu the earth, it swept down liko
a bright angel of death and destruction ;
it struck the earth with u sound like a
sudden, terrific clap of thunder, and
seemed to make tho surrounding hills
quiver to their foundations; great num­
bers of trees on their rocky sides fell, and
continued falling for several minute
afterwards, making noises like the pro­
longed reverberations of the thunder
among rocky cliffs..
The men were about four hundred
yards from tho placo where the fiery
tnlbtive from the sky struck, ami were
afraid to go and examine the place for
several hours afterwards. Thi-y took cour­
age, however, and being joined by num­
ber's of the people living-in the surround
ing neighborhood, they proceeded to the
place, and found that it had struck upon
a flat Iedgo of rocks in a wagon way lead­
ing from a farm house to the publiu mad.
The fragments oC stone were thrown
around for several rods in all directions ;
the ledge, '""b'ch is said to be three feet
thick, without any seams, was disturbed
for, a distance of about fifty feet, split and
.torn up. in 'fragment; the-soil, which
was spread in thin layers all over it, look­
ed as if passed through a sieve. At the
point where the strange body came in
contact with the reck, there appeared to
be no storm at all, but a very hue, white,
tlowerysortof paste, which was quite hot,
and a steam ascended out of the hole in
which ithad buried itself which was too
hot to appprosch.
Several gontlomen of a philosophical
turn of mind wem-stronGly of the opin­
ion that it was an terolito brought into
a &tate of fusion by coming down through
the atmosphere, but had not been com­
pletely burned before touching the
earth?
There was a strong odor about the
place, such as may be found in blasting
lurnaces, and the passage of tho lerolite
was marked by a light, yellowish sort of
smoke. Very fine particles of some sort
of, oxide continued to fall all over the
country for several hourf.
It is the intention of the people to or­
ganize a working party to quarry out
what remains of the body, which is un-
.doublciily metal, as soon, as the temper
ature oi mo races win aaniic.
As yet It seems to be premature to en­
ter on any speculation relative to the
nature of the strange phenomenon.
Moreover, the scientific men of the city
are already interested in tho matter, and
no doubt there will be a thorough diag-
nosiii of the strange case.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045160/1868-08-15/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,tu_bonnielou_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Memphis daily appeal.,S.T.

A Golden Thought. I never
found heartless pride in a noble nature,
uor humility in an unworth}' mind. Of
all the trees, I observe that God has cho­
sen the vine, a low plant that creeps along
the wall; of all the beasts the patient
lamb ; of all the fowls, the patient dove.
When God appeared to Moses, it was not
in the lofty cedar, nor in the spreading
palm, but in a hush—as if he would by
these selections check the conceited aro­
gunce of man. Nothing produces love
like humility ; nothing hate, like pride.

DkarSir: Knclosed is n sample of
combine wool grown ill Illinois, and
worth 50 to Xtu to-day in our market in
tho unwashed condition. The demand
for these wools is increasing ho rapidly
it will be impossible for tho American
farmers to supply enough of them lor
years to come.
Three-fourth blood wools aro now
crown in excess of the wants of the
country, and soon California and Texas
will raise enormous quantities of this
quality, and probably cause a further
reduction in the price. If our farmers
In the present wool growing sections
wish to raise wool at a prolit, they can
do so quite easily and with but light
expense in making the change.
Let them buy ot the Canadian farmers
young Leicestershire bucks at a
cost ol ?S to 510 each, and cross them
with their medium and coarse wool
ewes, and they will produce sheep valuable
for mutton, and bearing the wool
which is most wanted and sure to com- .

be hardy, but they should be sheltered .
from storms in winter and fed on turnips
and other roots rather thau corn,
that the wool staple may be strong and
lustrous. !

Picking and Packing Strawberries for

Market.

Strawberries should bo carefully picked
after the dew has dried off the vines, car­
ried to a shed or shady place in the field,
aud spread out thinly on a clean sheet or
cloth. When perfectly cool from sun
heat, and all external moisture la dried,
they should thon be carefully aorted by
trusty persons who will use care to put
none in the cup or basket that are over­
ripe, bruised, or of Inferior size. The
cups or baskets should be well filled, and
slightly rounded. Place the top layer,
which should be of choice berries, with
the hulls down or out of sight as nrtch a
possible, but not ""topping oil ""to much
that tho top of the cup will not be a fair
representation of tho rest. All sandy fruit
should be kept by itself, and if sent to
market, not faced with fruit that is not
sandy, but put up to be sold for what it
is. Neither should unripe berries be put
iu the bottom, and faced with ripe ones ;
they had better be thrown away. The
pickers must be watched, and those who
will not pick the fruit carefully, and in
proper condition, should be discharged.
Ono bruised or over-ripe berry iu a cup,
will, in twenty-four hours, ferment, mold
and spoil the whole cup full. In picking
strawberries, the hull should be left on, aa
it prevrut bleeding, and the fruit will
keep a great while longer.
The package should hold what they
profess to contain, a full quart, pint, or out
third of a quart, and should be so filled
when packed as to be full when they ar
rive in market. From the experience of
my sill and all the principal dealer of
iruti lor tuo past ten year, mere I no
basket ia which berries will carry ao well,
and command uch ready sale, and con­
sequently such high prices a the lleecher

Changing Cattle from Hay to Grass.

The change from bay to grass In tbe
feeding of cattle should not be too sudden
but gradual ; grass in its early spring
growth Is weak and watery, the juice as
Well as the fiber requlros more age and
sunshine to give it body and atrength
sufficient to form a healthy food ; besides
this, it ia bad economy to turn atok on
to pasture when so little nourishment can
be obtained from a large surface. It ia
hotter therefore to feed hay, if you have
it, until the pasture has acquired sufficient
age and muturity that no ill eflocts will
follow the transition from hay to grass. It
ia better when cattle are turned on to
grass in the spring to not let them Indulge
to satiety, but take them off and put them
to hay again until the next day, giving
them but ono feed of grass a day, and that
not a full one for the IirBt two weeks ; and
lor two or three longer it will be better to
take them off about the middle of the af
tcrnoon, and put them to hay until next
morning.
By this course of treatment cattle will
be kept healthy and go through the warm
weather of summer in better condition.
They will be the better for being protected
from cold storms and rains at all seasons.
They should have salt once or twice a
week and a full supply of pure fresh wa­
ter, so placed, that they can drink when
they please. They Bhould never be hur­
ried when passing from ono field to
another, nor when being driven up to
milk should never be frightened with
dogs nor alarmed by stranger passing
throueh their pasture grounds, but be
kopt as calm and free from excitement as
possible. Attention to those littlo matters
will pay a good percentage on the time
and troublo. American Stock Journal.

Then and Now.

A coriwspondent of the Rural Jiete
Yorker say:
Tho question "" Why new land doe not
produce as well as whon tho country was
new V"" hag often been asked through the
agricultural press, and as often answered
many theories givea, though not the
right one, In my opinion. The true rea­
son, I think, is simply thia : When the
country was new wood and lumber were
ao plenty that all the forest trees, except
tho choicest, wore burned in the fallow,
leaving the ashea upon the land. Most of
tho substance which passed on tn the air
in the form, of neat and smoke would set­
tlo to earth again with dews and rain,
leaving the accumulated product of cen
turies upon the soil. Now a far different
course is pursued. All trees fit for lumber
are taken to the sawmills all fit for ties
to some railroad station, and nearly all
that ia left fit for stove or cord wood, and
that too is either taken oil or sold, leav
ing nothing but brush to burn. What is the
real difference whether all the trees are
taken off and sold, or whether the land was
cleared many years ago and all of its pro
ducts taken off and sold ? Who can ex
pect fertile soil where everything is taken
on ana noining reiurnca, ana wny uis
cuss the question T

Getting Corn Rows Straight.

J. A. M.. Mason couhty, 111 , writes to
the Prairie Farmer : For tho benefit of
those of vour readers that have difficulty
in getting their corn row atraight and
even, 1 propose to explain to mom now to
construct a gauge to attach to their corn
planters, that will never fail to make
straight and even rows with less than half
the troublo of the old way, . ., Dy Belling
stakes, and runnina- or driving to them.
It ia very simple of construction, and any
farmer can easily make one. It was in
vented bv a farmer in the adjoining coun
ty, who intended to got it patented, but for
some reason railed.
The material consists of a piece of
board, sar eighteen or twenty inches lonr,
ten inches wu.e, and ono inch thick, to be
rounded off at each end like a hand sled
runner. Another board will bo required,
three or four inches wide, an Inch thick
and eiirht feet lone, for a four feet planter.
(and shorter in proportion to the width of
the planter). One end to De moniseu
into tho runner or marker, exactly
iu the middle and about one inch
from tbe top. or the atraight edge
that is of the runner, and in the other
end of the slat or arm bore a half inch
holo within two inchea of the end, which
goes on an Iron bolt or pin inserted in the
planter tongue, just oe&ina tne aouDie
trees, or hammers strap. And then there
is a rope or strap with a hook or snap on
the end of it, which 1 to be hooked er
snapped into the breast strap, and the oth­
er end to be fastened to the runner.
The gauge or marker run aloDg aide of
the planter and make a plain mark to
run back by, and all you have to do ia to
drive the planter astride of the mark and
when you get to the end of the field, the
dropper geus off, take off the marker by
uuhookiug the rope or strap from the
hame-ring, and take the marker arm off
or the bolt or pin in the tongue, and when
the planter is turned around put it on
again ; it i the work of a moment, and
saves the time and trouble of getting off
the planter(oace or twice.going once across
the field) to set tbe slakes.
Nearly all the farmers in thia country
have adopted the use of them and would
not uso anything else ; a great many use
them on their marker or sleds for mark­
ing off corn and they work equally aa
well.
Farmers, try one ; it docs not take half
an hour to make one, and the cost of the
materia ia comparatively nothing. .

The •« Sleeping iXeamy** of Tonnes.
•co, by one VI ho Has Seen Her.
Union City, Tenn,, (May 14,) Correspondence Of the
LouiniUe Commercial.
So much has already been written in regard
to the lady known here as tho “ Sleeping Beau­
ty,’’ that 1 can scarcely hope to give yon any­
thing new, but will add my testimony to that
already given, and make you a plain statement
of facts, as I know them from her mother,
brother and friends who now have her in
charge in tho same boose in which I am
stopping, and from which I am now writing to
von. Miss Susan Caroline Godsav was bom in
Obion County, Tenn., and within’ten miles of
this city, of poor bat very respectable parents.
Her father has been dead for over twelve
rears. Her mother still lives and watches over
her loved child, and tho sunken eyes and far­
rowed brow show very plainlr (he trials
and sorrows she has experienced in her duty
for twenty-one years. Sue is very poor, and,
to some extent, dependent on the contribu­
tions of visitors, to take care of and procure
proper supplies for her charge.
Miss Godsay was taken sick when about 4
▼care of age, with wliat waa supposed to bo
chills and fever, but which baffled tho «kni of
nurses and physicians for more than two years,
at which time she fell into a nervous sleep,
from which sho has not woko since for a
longer time than twelve minutes. She usually
sleeps soundly from 11 o’clock at night until
about 6 in tho morning, and through tho day
awakes about once an hour. Her waking
spells are never of less than four nor
more than twelve, but usually about six min­
utes duration. In her waking moments she
speaks both pleasantly and intelligently, an­
swers promptly any question asked her, and
appears qnito happy and contented.
One of the strangest points of thin strange
case is tbo seemingly total absence of anything
like respiration. A piece of the finest polished
glass held to her bps fails to disclose tbo
slightest I race of breath. Her poise is perfectly
still, and bnt for a nervous or tremulous mo­
tion of tbo body, which never ceases, vou
might at any time call her dead. Sho has
grown during her affliction from a little child
to about tbo average height of her sox, and
weighs ninety-six pounds, and although her
body and bands enow her very poor in flesh,
her face is full and smooth, and her features
well developed. Indeed, such a rare stylo do
her features portray tliat she is not inappro­
priately called tho Sleeping Beautv of Tennes­

Some one says truly that the best way
for a man to train up a child in the way
it should go is to travel that way himself
sometimes.
inax;N Fly on Roses. Strong tobacco
water, it is said, will destroy these pests.
A pound or two of tobacco put into a bar
rel of water, and allowed to eoak two or
three days, will make a liquid that will
answer well for this purpose. Suds made
from tobacco-soap will also answer.
Gal Limb in Compost. One of the
best modes of using gas lime, it is saiel,
is first finely pulverizing it, sndthen mix­
ing it in the compost heap say one-tenth
or one-twentieth lime with a mixture ot
yard or stable manure, in alternating lay­
ers of loam or turf. Another way, to pul­
verize it tine and spread it over the fields
evenly, at the rate of fifty bushels, or less,
per acre, some mouths bttre a crop is
planted, or else on grass
A whiter in the Journal of thc Royal
Agricultural Society, describing the per­
manence of the action of lime, says that
he knows a piece oi ground containing
100 acres, which formerly grew nothing
but heath. A good dressing of lime was
applied on the surface of ti e ward which
has nearly doubled its value. This was
done several years ago and teitally eradi­
cated the heath The lime to this day ap­
pears in full action, as its effect annually
testify, from the richness and sweetness
of the herbage, the texture of which has
boen entirely changed by the application
of lime.

by nutritious and succulent food, which

start.
A calf that maintains a precarious exist­
ence on poor hay and straw, and grows
Up without care or carrots, can scarceiv
make a good cow, even if it has good aii
cestors, and is well treated in after life.
There is no place for neglect in the milk
business. All thinirs renn ire to be trained

I'hird, docility and good behavior are

essential cluuacteruaics of a good ow
they are secured by kindness and famil­
iarity. Farmers should never neglect
their calves, as they do their own mmtlics,
Unless they are willing to have them
grow up wild and ungovernable. Culti­
vate la all tl. as USSes constant and kindly
rel itions from the very beginning.
Fourth, guard against drouth in sum
mer, and short supplies in Winter, by se­
curing early a good quantity of bran or
shorts. These, as well as roots, pumpkins,
apples, am i well preserved corn fodder,
peculiarly adapted to the production
of milk.
Fifth, cut yonr hay early ! Woody fiber
Is a good thing la its place, or it never
would have beefl sent, but no orthodox
in oi has any right to believe that it is
much adapted to dairy purposes. Cut
your hay Just as the blossoms fall. Keep
n mag every eight no rains and no dew
upon Be sure and dry it, enough so
thai i' will keep perfectly sweet, without
must, and i- s;re and not dry it any
more than is Deoen arv.
Sixth, unless :v is a remarkably

milk ms a neces try Ol life, and nevat I S

having one it would be the poorest go
farrow, and then go to the shambles.
Eighth, deformity and butter are not
inseparable companions. You may have
a good looking cow that will ill 1 your pail
quite as well as the historical "" brindJe
cow with a crumple horn,"" crooked leg,
sha?gy coat, flat rib, sloping rump, and ir­
repressible bak bone.
You may breed quite successfully for
beef purposes, while you secure a good
supply of most excellent milk.
Ninth, let everything be done decently,
cleanly, and regularly.
Tenth, provide good, warm, well venti­
lated stables, and never omit to groom
and bed your animals.

L-ng1h
of Whiffle-Trecf.
A nonsn cannot draw as weil with a
whiille-tree twelve feet long as with one
two feet six inches in length, because the
line of draught is not in the propel direc­
tion to be most effective. Nur ein two
horea, harnessed abreast, draw well with
whillle-trees ten feet long, while their
heads are coupleel close together, because
they must travel sidewise, more or less, in
which position PO animal can exert all his
strength to the best aelvantage in hauling
a load.
Horses draw best with a double whillle-
trce int loner enoueh to allow them to
stand close to each other, having singl
whifSe-trees attached directly behind
them, and just long enough to meet in the
midule. W hen the double-tree is very
lone, each horse must draw more or less
sidewise. if thc COUoUne lines and the
neckyoke are not made Tmg enough t
allow them to move directly for war;
without having their heads turned toward
each other. In order to determine the
correct length of whifns-tress. let two
horses stand side by side, with their sides
three inches anart : then measure from
the centre of onmhorse to the other on
their backs. This will give tho length
for a neckyoke, and the correct length
tor the double Whiffle tree, between the
joints where the single-trees are to
be attached. When a neckyoke is
only eighteen inches long, and
the double-tree of the proper length,
horses will be required to move more er
less sidewise. For the same reason, oxen
often get in the habit of hauling sidewise,
because the yoke is too short. Neither
oxen or horses can travel easily and freely,
when their heads are turned toward, aud
their butts from, each other.
Whiffle-trees tor plowing should always
be as short as the? can be made, without
bringing the traces against the lees of the
team. A very long double Whiffie-trec
te nds to lr.ak-i a plow take too wide afurrow-slice.
If the clevis be adjusted to
tukc a narrow furrow siicu when the
double tree ist o long the plow will not
run at all satisfactory. The horse in the
furrow will not be able to waik rquarely
in his pi ce, because the line of draught
is such as to keep crowding his hind feet
out of the furrow on thc plowed ground.
The length of the double whiille-tree and
the neck yoke for a sleigh should be just
as lemg as the sleigh is wide, from thc
centre of one runner to the other. The

Suggestions on Grafting.
CoNsiDE3AiLE observation and experi­
ence convince me that the old plau of
cleft grafting is uot the true or best way.
I have for several years grafted more or
less for myself and neighbors, and the
StlBJietlcu which my plan has given hjs
led me to think that' it may benefit oth­
er. I shall not attempt to say one-half
that niigiit be said on the important sub­
ject, but will try and get at the main facts
as direct as possible.
In the old plan the limbs selected are
fr an one to three inches in diameter, cut
unase ell"" and split throuirh the center, and
a cion being set on each tide, leaving an
opening between quite as wide as the cion
is thick. Thc limns are generally cut be­
low all the small twigs or leaf branches,
foftting all the sap into the cion, which
grows rapiilly the first year, loosening the
wax on the limb, leaving thc split open
for the water to run in every time it rains.
The growth of the cion aitimatety heal""
up thc spiit on both sides, ?o that it holds
the water until it dries out ; this kills
more or less of the wood in the heart of
the limb by the time it heals over, often
taking fool or live years. Then what
dead wood there is, as soon as it to ex­
cluded from the drying effects of the air,
absorbs the sap of r.e: limb and at nee
begins to decay, (dien killing the tree be­
fore it has borne fruit enouü to half pay
for gratUng.
I will now give my plan and mention
some of the advantages over t he old plan.
1 cut the limbabtmting so that, thc ingle
shall be about two-thirds as long as the.
.i-ibis thick, being careful to have the
slant on the under side of thc limb. Then
split the limb up and down through tne
center, never setting but one cion in a
limb, and seldom rutting a limb over an
i :
inch through, being eoverned bv the
Shape I wish to give the top. 1 generally
put all the cions into a ton thc first year.
This can be elone where the limbs are cut
above the small twigs, or leal brand',
which w ill take a part of the sap the first
year; then cut them off as soon as the
growth of the cion shall require it.
I think it will be readily seen that
by cutting the limb slanting and Setting
the cion on the upper sale, there is
no chance for the water to remain
long enough to kiii the wood. It will
be seen, also, that by cutting the limb
where it is small that it will sooner grow
over, and the cum will sooner grow to the
size of the limb cut off. Every one who
has had much experience in grafting
hnows very well that it requires a good
deal of judgment and skill to form a good,
healthy fruit bearing top, and none but
those who understand the business should
be allowed to cut a limb from a tree, either
to trim or graft It. Cor. Haffen Guiticator.

In tho jostling, headlong raco,

Ero the wrong ho was forced to embrace;
And if you would learn these things, tho way
Is to ''put yourself in his place.""

Who blameless stands before God,
But whom bis follows bavo utterly scorned,
And mado to ""pass under the rod;""

have also used it with marked effect in
erysipelas.”

stationary.

which proved so successful in England.
Charlotte Cush men once related the
following anecdote: She said a man
in the gallery of the theatre (she was
on the stage at the time) made such a
distuibance that the play could not
proceed. Cries of “ Throw him over ”
arose from all parts of the house, and
the noise became furious. A ll’ was
tumultuous chaos, until a sweet female
voice was heal’d in the pit, exclaiming,
“ No, I pray you don’t throw him over!
I beg of you, dear friends, don’t throw
him over, but—kill him where he is!”

A Sea Captain’s Humane Act Punished.
The Liberal Christian has the fol­
lowing anecdote from a gentlemen who
was an eye-witness of the circumstance
narrated;
“The thermometer often stands for
days at from 109 to 117 degrees in the
Bed Sea, and when the vessel is with
the wind, and traveling at about the
speed of the air, the lack of any breeze
or ventilation makes life on the steam­
er almost insupportable. On this oc­
casion four men and two passengers
were so overcome with* the heat that the
ship’s doctor reported that they must
die if the ship’s course was not chang­
ed and a breeze created by travelling
against the wind. The captain very
reluctantly, and in dire fear of his com­
many’s orders, yielded to the cry of
humanity, and steamed one hundred
miles back on his course. He thus re­
duced the oppressive temperature twen­
ty degrees; ventilated his ship, and
saved the lives ( probably ) of six pass­
engers. The Government fined the
company ( who excused the captain, al­
though not without a warning not to
do so again) a thousand pounds for
going out of the proscribed route with
her Majesty’s mails.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033295/1871-06-07/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,whi_carrie_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Watertown republican.,J.W.

but if you will give your dog water
enough it is pretty certain he can't have
the disease. The safest way to insure him
an abundance of this indispensablo fluid is
to anchor him in about seven lect oi
water, so that his head will be from
eighteen to twenty-five inches below the
surface. In that way he can drink as
much as he wants. Any surplus he may
chance to swallow will do more good than

T)oino good under diffiaulties is thus il
lustrated in the experience of a missionary

It was customary in former days
for all the ladies of the best families
j to attend the barbecues; and this was
| especially the case in the contest be­
tween Mr. Brcckenridge ami General
I Combs, in 1844. Out of these affairs
[grew the authentic story uf the nicest
widow in the blue-grass region. Not
fur trom the Forks oi Elkhorn lived
the pretty little widow Fauntloroy,
and one of her nearest neighbors was
Gen. Pevton. The Gen. had looked
upon the little widow Very much as
he looked upon his blooded liuise
Powltalian—""The finest horse, sir, in
the blue-grass region.""
The pretty Mrs. Fauntlerov had
been a widow more limn a year;
while the Gen. having a great regard
lor etiquette, had waited patiently
for that time to ilapse, in order to
declare himself. But the widow, with
her woman's art, kept her lover at
bav. and vet kept him in her train.
lie had escorted her to this barbe­
cue,and when returning had expressed
Ids satisfaction at the prospects of
Gen. Combs, and the success o! the
Whig p irfv.

As luck would have it, good or ill,
the widow's girth broke when just at
the commencement of the steep part.
The ladv, still seated on her saddle,
slid swiftly back into the water,
while her horse went up the bank
like an arrow.
John Peyton leaped from his horse,
and in an instant caught the floating
lady and saddle, and. before the Gen,
had recovered from his astonishment
was at the lop ol' the bank with bis
burden. The little widow was equal
to Hie occasion, for she hogged the
Gen. to ride on and stop her horse,
which had now begun to understand
his part in the mishap, and was be
ginning to increase his gait toward
home.
The Gen. did as he was bid. ami
soon returned with the horse. In tin*
meantime John Peyton had secured1
li is own horse, and when the General
came back with the widows horse
-he and John were lunching merrily
over the ridiculous accident, hut what
further passed between them is only
known to themselves.

for hia wayward dmposi­

tKwu Hi. father, Oscar L, was a great dis
molin.nan. and insisted that his two eon.
should be treated by tkairteachms with th
same seventy aa ordinary schoolboy a. He
himself would examine their pda positions
.iter schoolhonrs; and.when he found that
thpy were not satisfactory, 'be would ad­
minister witb Un own band* the re­
quired correction. Having received soys rat
rather painful castigations in this manner,
the yonpg Prince (hoar. In hia 12th year,
runaway from home, and ancoeded in find­
ing hia way to Copenhagen, where the emis­
saries of his distracted parents found him
playing in the street at marbles with some
little ragamuffins. Ho European Prince
ever presented a more ludicrous aspect than
yonng Oscar when he was thus found, b.r»-
f»oted.|>cd his clothes soiled and torn. Bat
he aaeerta to the present day that he enjoyed
.himself glorionaly during that brief absence
from home.

lirhia 17 th year he was sent to the Uni­
versity of Upeala, where he took part In aU
the practical jokes, of which the student#
.at that ancient seat of learning are so fond.
.After remaining there about six months he
shocked his royal father by coolly inform­
ing him that he had fallen desperately in
love with the daughter of one of the Uni­
versity professors, and was determined to
marry her.
As a matter of course. King Oscar would
nos permit this; and the young man waa
recalled to Stockholm, where he waa nos
leng in becoming very popular by his
unaffected manners, and by the
timpllcity of his conduct. He de­
lighted in walking through the streets
of Stockholm after nightfall in an humble
suit of clothes; and many an act of brutali­
ty os the part of the police was prevented
by hia gallant and timely intervention. He
was aleo invariably present at fires in the
capital, and nothing could preventhim from
working on such occasions with the utmost
vigor at the engines.
In 1852, he ana a young friend of similar
disposition made an excursion to Christiana
in Norway. They travelled Icooguito, and
registered assumed names at second-class
hotels. Strolling after dark through the
streets of the oxey they unfortunately were
attacked by a gang of robbers, who Knock­
ed » them down and rilled their pockets.
'Without a cent in their pockets the two
distinguished gentlemen returned to iUeir
betel. Next morning the landlord presented
his hill to them. Xney confessed they had
no money, owing to their mishap the night
before. The landlord utterly refused to be­
lieve their story and threatened to invoke
the interference of the police. Vainly did
they try to dissuade him from his purpose,
but, rushing from the room, he not only
looked them iu but placed at the door a
stalwart porter armed with a club.

The position in which the future King of
Sweden was placed was so ludicrous that he
could not help bursting into a peal of laugh*
ter. When the irate landlord finally re ap­
pe&red andbronghttwopulioeiDen with him,
the two gentlemen exulaired who they were,
but they bad some difficulty in establishing
their identity.
■ When the Court of Stockholm selected a
German Princess as consort of the wayward
Otoar,the latter went seeretly to Luheok,and,
in dieftnue,traTel«d withheron the steamer
that conveyed her from that port to Stock­
holm, watching his intended bride with the
oloetst attention. Wnat he saw of her
satisfied him that she was an excellent
young woman, and he has ever since proved
an affectionate husband to her.

The people of Stockholm know many other
amusing stories about the eccentricities of
their young King: but they know, also, that
he warmly sympathizes with the people, and
they are convinced that his reign will be
prosperous and beneficial to the country*","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014064/1872-10-05/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,dlc_clark_ver03,"","","",true,ca,Chicago tribune.,Tribune Co.,"Chicago, Ill.","","",2943,685,4946,26886,2,21896,28416,0,dlc_clark_ver03/data/sn82014064/no_reel/1872100501/0002.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_clark_ver03%2Fdata%2Fsn82014064%2Fno_reel%2F1872100501%2F0002.jp2/pct:13.440811,2.410614,22.588601,94.615709/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_clark_ver03%2Fdata%2Fsn82014064%2Fno_reel%2F1872100501%2F0002.jp2/pct:13.440811,2.410614,22.588601,94.615709/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

The gnides, growing anxious, cried “ Gentlemen,
it would be better for you to hold on to the ends
of the ropes;” Still the ropes remained slack,
and no answer came from the murky cavern
below. Twenty minutes passed and the adven­
turers were'yet silent. It was' then proposed
that one of the gnides should be lowered and

a dean sweep into her cabin. Tho Melpomene
went ashore. A tug ran under the bows of the
Great ""Western to haul her to a place of safety,
n:id was never seen again, having been literally
twallowed up by the sea.
At Clifton, near Bristol, the pinnacle of Christ
Church fell and went right through tho roof.
Pi ecisely the same thing happened to churches
Bt Yeovil, at Creukerno, aud at Taunton. Heavy
pieces of architecture, such as walls aud lowers
that had stood the storms of centuries, were de­
molished.

In Savernako forest, Marlborough, ninety
""magnificent forest trees, all close together, were
i-io-vn down. /

Buildings were unroofed in many towns,
vc-rrcio were dashed by the score against the
coast, A stone wall at Richmond, 100 feet long
aul 3 feet high, was prostrated. Carnages in
£cme places were blown entirely over. Several
Accidents happened to gasometers, leaving

Young Simpson, just beginning the study
?' natural philosophy, becam- hud of apply­
ing technical narora to common objects to
impress hearers with a sense of bis profound
knowledge, and tried the game with bis
father one evening. When he mentioned to
him that be had swallowed some marine
acephalous mollosks, the old man was much
alarmed, and he suddenly seized Simpson
and threw bim to the floor, aud held him'
and screamed fo.· help. And when Mrs!
Simpson came with some warm water and
the hired man rushed in with a garden pumn
they forced half a gallon of water down
Simpson's throat, and th(η held him by the
heels over the edge of the po.cb, aud shook
him, while the old man said : ""If we Λ„η>»
get them things out of William he will be
piiened."" And when they >ere out, and
William explained tbat the articles alluded to
were merely oysters, then his father fondled
him for half an hour with a trunk strap for
scaring the family. S'lbeequentlv, Simpson
framed his language in more familiar phrase.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016025/1873-03-21/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,me_damariscotta_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Portland daily press.,N.A.

Catching the Early Trail.
One of tbe greatest delight! at boardng
in tbe country for the tamper, is tbe
pleasure a man derives from hJreSorts Ic
:atch the early morning .trait, bj-whieh ,
se mutt teach the city and Us badness. ;
When ho gets out of bad he loot* at bit 1
watch, and finds he has plenty ol time, so
be drtsaes leisurely, and siu down to
breakfast Is a calm and serene stale of
mind. Just as he cracks his first egg, be
bear the up train. He starts, Jerks out
bis watch, compares it with tbe clock,
and finds that it is eleven minutes slow,
and tbal be has only lour minutes left in
which to get to tbe depot. In a tearful
hurry he tries to scoop the egg out ot tbe
shell, but it burns bis flngen, tbe skin
U tough, and after tooling with it lor
a n-cL-tii it mashes into a hopeless
reus, and he gets bis fingers
smeared.' He drops the whole concern
In disgust, grabs a bol roll, and scalds
bis tongue with a quick mouthiul of collee:
then he atufii tbe roll Into bis mouth,
while his wife bands bim his sstcbel, and
tells him the thinks she hears the whistle.
Be plunges madly around the room
looking for bis umbreUs; then kisses his
wile as well as be can with all that unswallowed
bread distending bb cheeks,
says giKKl byo to tbe children in a lump,
and makes a dash for the door. Jost ae
be goes to the gate be find* that be ha*
fjrgouea bis duster, and be charges back
after it, snstcbes it up, and tears down
tbo gravel walk in a Irenzy. He doesn't
like 10 run through the village, because
[bat would be undignified; but he Walks
furiously. Half way down ho doa bear
the traiu whistle, for certain. He wants
to run, but he knows that he will
i tart up tbst yellow dog there
bv the sidewalk if he does. Then
be actually sees the train coming
in at tbo depot, and be <eels that he mutt
Bake a rush. He does. The yellow dog
Becomes excited, and teare after bim.
Six other dogs join in the chase, one alter
he other, and bark furiously, and frolic
iround his legs. Small boys contribute
a tbe excitement as be goes put, by
whistling on their fingers, and the men at
Fork on the new meeting-bouso knock
>8 to look at him and laugh. He Jeels
ridiculous, but be must catch that train.
9e gets desperate wben be baa to slacken
ip until two or three women, who are on
Ac sidewalk discussing the servant-girl
juestion and the price of butter, scatter
10 let him pass. Ho arrives within one
mndred yards of the depot with duster
}n tVin wln/1 /wint fail hnrtinntal

ind me yellow dog nipping till heeli, Just
is the train begins to move. Be puts
on extra pressure, and resolves to
make tliat train or perish. Be reaches
it a; the last car is going past.
Be seizes the hand-rail, b violently jerkid
around once or twice, bat finally lands
in the step on bis knees, and is hauled in
ay his coat collar by the brakeman, hot,
uad, dusty, with his trousers torn across
[be knees, his shins bruised, and three
ribs in his umbrella broken. Just as he
jets comfortably into the car, the train
stops, backs up on the aiding, and lies
there (or half an hour while the engineer
files a broken valve. Then he is madder
than ever, and determines that he will
move in town to morrow, and swears,
while he looks out of the window and
watches the dogs that followed him engaged
in a contest over a bone which the
pellow dog found on the platform of the
station; and he registers a silent vow to
ievote hi"" first holiday to hunting up that i
log and braining him with a club.

13 ut I had great faith in the
tucceta of my venture This was
Monday; the paper was issued on
Friday, and there .texxi tho ad­
1 vertisement that was to bring us
a 'perfectJewel of a girl,' ""
Tho next Monday morning,
mamma had a sick headache, and
wliV I was busy orer the wash
tub in the kitchen, singing J3it
Me in My Littlo Bed,1 (boing tho
most lackadaisical thing I could
think of) a buggy drovo to the
door, and a neatly dressed young
Isdy came la and iufurmed me
that she had seen our advertise­
ment in the paper, tncT would like

tho situation if agreeable to us.

Her quiet dignity qmto npsct me
I was not prepared for this.
A tall, slender girl, with a del
icate pink sea-shell complexion,
such masses of goldcn-blondo
hair, and, 6trange to say, large,
black eyes, shaded by dark lashes
and brows. There was the un­
mistakable air of a lady about hor,
nnd I wondered if I should ever
want or dare tobosa' her. .
I ccnclnded her services would
be agreeable, so 1 showed her to
her room, and Will and tho hired
man carried up her trunk.
In live or ten minutes sho came
down, attired in a neat, brown
calico dress, with a pretty cam­
bric ruftle In the neck, and an­
nounced herself ready to com­
mence operations. .1 wondered if
those slender white, hands knew
how to do anything, but I was not
very long left in doubt. All that
day, Loniee llale and I worked
together, now in the kitcldn, now
in the dining-room, and finally,
in the afternoon toilets, sewing in
the cool north chambers, with
Grace. We talked of nothing but
our work, ana tnougu sue
seemed willing to do anything
that was to be done, she mado no
pretentions to being overanxious
to make herself nsefnl, I was as
tonished at tho easo and deftness
with which sho turue J ' off the
work .
""How do yon suppose sho ever
could be at such work?"" said Wil­
lie. ""J never was inoro taken
buck than when I snw this liand-
eotr.o creature mashing potatoes
when I came in to dinner.1
Well,"" sidd Grace, ""it is a
mystery to me.""
I believe I'd lock my door to
night,"" said Will tcaidngly. He
was always laughing at our cow
ardice about strangers in tho
house.
Wo were standing at the gar
den crntn. nndor Ilm wonninou-U-low,
Graco and Willie and J,
feeling a liltlo sad at the thought
of being eo soon separated.
I had been feeling half angry
at Iit-slio Clare, tor coming to tako
away our darling, hut, to night, ns
I saw her in tho palo moonlight
looking so sweet and pretty, 1
should have been more angry with
him if he had not loved her and
waited to carrv her off.
I turned from her beauty to go
to the house, and there on the
upper piazza stood the'hirod girl,
her arm embracing the pillar, her
side faco turned to us; the sweet
est smile curled the full red lips,

thing very pleasant and amnsing.
No,"" said I softly, to Grace.as
we tamo up the walk, ""she is 'do
poor forlorn creature who has lost
her fortune aud is heroically fac­
ing stern ""work lor a living.""
4SIie hasnevtr come hero from
necessity : she has corao from

we stepped into the house.
The wedding preparations went
on swimmingly now. Mamma re
covered from her headache. Lou-
ieo took entire-charge of kitchen
and dining-room, and invnr'ably
helped ns'with the6cwingin the
lone afternoons. Sho was an in
valuable girl.
One afternoon Leslie came
over and brought The Innocents
Abroad, then just out, and read
aloud to us as wo sewed,
After tea wo retnrned to our
work and tho book, with which
wo were delighted.
The sun went down in splendor.
The book and work was finally
laid aside, and wo foundoursclvcs
in one of thoso long; talks about
Iwoks and authors wo always en
joyed so much.

A slight . disagreement aroe
about the author of acertain work.
I wasopposod to Leslie and Graco,
who always agreed.
In despair I called npon Lon­
ise, saying: Yon think as I do,
don't yon, Louise?'' not having
the remotest idea that she
knew anything about the matter.
""YeC'she made answer quiet
ly, and then wont oa to give
proofs ot the correctness of our
position so strong that Grace and
Leslie were obliged to come over
onr belief.
Long, long wo sat thcro in the

twilight.
- 1 never hourd any ono talk so
fluently as did Louise that night.
How much she had read! What
racy, 6picy criticisms she mado of
this and that work !
I longed to ask . her whore sho
had read so much, hut feired I
might force her to discloso some-
s9
thing sho wished to keep secret,
and so 1 for chore.
Guests from a distance began
to arrive; among them was cousin
Charlio Huzlet, from New York.
Graco had spent tho last summer
in his native town, and had given
me rate accounts of; his manly
beatity, his talents and fascination..
1 was prepared for a great flirt,
and had a sort of nervous dread
ot him. He came. He was h ind
some, tall and dark and fclender,
with a haughty, or rather earnest,
way of looking at'ono as though
ho read one's thoughts. At timeJ.
however, ho was 6o gay and bril­
liant that I lost my horror of him.

and we crew very cousinly.
He remarked Louise's beauty
to mo one day, but did not seem
to notice her again for some days.
Belle Raymond, one of Grace's
bridesmaids, was all admiration
for Charlio, and one day asked
mo if I was not sorry ho was my
Cousin.
1 was very obtuso, could not
understand her meaning.
I took lTelle's arm, and walking
ettaight up to Charlie, 6;iid: ""Uelle
thinks I ought to be sorry you
aro my cousin. Can you imagine
any reason why I should jvish
you less near than a cousin ""
What ever posicsscd me to say
such words!
He looked her scarchingly in
the face until tho rich color came
into her clear olive cheek, and
her gray eyes fell to tho fhiur.
Then turning to me, ho said:
""Among my relatives I number
my best, almost rny only, friends.
it ii, .fin irf you, also,
both a const u and a tncuu.
Was this the flirt I had been
warned against? 'IIo is too broth
erly to be much of a trifler,""
thought I. Dut Hello said con­
fidentially :
1 am afraid of him; he means
mischief.""
The wedding came off glorious
ly, Grace wore white tarleton
and orange blossoms, and looked
""too sweet for anything,"" little
Lillie said.
Tho hi-iise was full of company
for nearly a week, aud Louise did
everything, and looked so beauti
ful that people asked in astonish
ment. ""Who sho could bo ?"" I
could only tell them sho was our
""hired girl.""
Tho day after the wedding wo
a'l went to the depot to seo the
young couple off,""and Ictt L uiso
to caro for tho house.
Wo returned in tho twilight,
and ns we rodo slowly up tho
drive, the sound of music came
softly from tho open parlor win­
dows. Willio drew up the reins
and we listened oagerly.
A gay, cheerful song, swcot and
clear as the notes of a bird. Now
up, then ll altering down softly as
if satisfied with its flight, and go
ing to rest. Wo were unheard
by tho singer as wo alighted, and
wo walked straight into the parlor
to sec tho bird.1
Why, Louise,"" I cried, ""why
did you never tell us you sang so
beautifully? You might !nVo en­
tertained ns so often had we
known It.""
""I believo that yotir ndvertlio­
tncntonly specified that I should

""Come,"" said Will, ""your can

enough. Now let it sbine for our
enlightenment.""

and Charlie advanced, as ho spoko
to the piano, and gracefully urged
her to bo reseated.-

""We Ijare had tea at the Ellis,
X thank yon, Miss O'FIsherty,""
answered Willio, ""and nothing
will appease our music.""
So Louiio sang. Willie sat by

and drauk every word, Cha'iloy
turned tle mut-ic for her as she
sang some of my pieces, and, at
her request, added a bass to some

of the choruses.
Willio grow uncomfortable as
he heard. how beautifully their
voices mingled in the songs, and
coming over to me, by the win
dow, ho said, quite confidentially:
'Why on earth can't I sing, Flo?'!
4Soyou u.ight help Louise?""
said I.
He colored a little, and 1, all
admiration for Louise, exclaimed:
""Isn'tsho splendid, perfectly
foecinatingt but I don't know what
to make of it.""
They were closing tho piano.
Louise was a triflj flushed. Char
lie invited her on the porch for a
promonade, but, sho declined
gracefully and soon rotired. Next
dsy, by tacit agreement, Louise
stood on a diffcret.t footing
beaut'ful, accomplished, educated
why should she not bo treated a
our equal ? But who was she ?
That was the only thing we were
in doubt about. Something re
strained mo from asking anything
concerning her tast life. In tbe
twilight I saw Willie ask her to
tako a ride. She said she would
go if 1 wont. So It was decided
to take tho double carriage and
invite Charlie to accompany ns.
What a delightful ride 1 Down by
the beautiful littlo falls in the
rivor we stopped, and Louise lean
ing a littlo out from tho front
seat, sang a merry water song,
full of ripples, trills and cascades
of melody. So tho annual sum­
mer passed along. One day, in
September, Louiso received a
letter the first sinco she had
ocen with ns. Sbe camo and told
mo she must leavo ns.
""No, no,"" eaid I. ""wo can nev
er do without you. Who say 8
you must go,""
answered sacliy. I,i am sorry,lor
1 have been very happy here.""
Even then, I dared not ask her
a singlo question about herself.
Another week and sho must go to
Southing, she told mc, a little
town about a hundred miles dist
ant. ""That is something definite
at last,"" thought I. The boys
and Louise got along splendidly,
and I never could imagino which
one she preferred. She socmcd
eo impartial and sisterly toward
them both, and no ono would im­
agino sho had any particular feel
ing for cither, but Vour folks"" saw
with some misgiving, that both
boys, were ' wonderfully at­
tracted by . tho hired girl. The
last night i saw Charlio ask Lou
ISO for a promenade in the garden.
As they parsed into a little side
arbor, I saw his arm crciicle her
waitt. Just then Willio came up
looking quite white. Ho had seen
them. Poor brother Willie I Late
in tho evening they camo in. I
heard them coma np tho stairs,
heard Cbarlie pass into his room.
Louise camo to my roni and
knocked. I arose nnd admitted
her. - A deep blight color was on
her.r-heek8, and her eyes showed
a new strange feeling. I waited
for her to speak. ,
""Flora, you can perhaps gness
tho canso, whon I tell yon that 1
am happier to-niuht than I have
ever been before.""
It's Charley ?"" said I.
""Yeo,"" 6aid she; ""and sinco you
will not atk me, I will Yoluutcer
to tell you why I havo been hero
ibis summer..
""Mr. Farrington, my guardian,
and I did not ngrco jerfectiy as
to my mode of spondig my time.
Ho objected to four hours daily at
the pianoj two or three in drees
and promenade, and tho remain­
der in eating, sleeping and read­
ing, and heM never lt mo travel,

quiries concerning me. He final­
ly gavo permission. I went to the

learned house-work, and one day
seeing your advertisement took a
wild notion to answer, . aud yon
know the rest. Mr. Farrington
ferretted me out or 1 should nt
be leaving to-morrow just as tho
threshers are upon you.""

""Long, long, wo talked that
night of tho past, prcsont, and the

brghtly dawning future. Next
day Mr. Farrington came, and
wo persuaded him to let Louieo
6 tay and be married here at
Christmas. So we got Ellen to
come back and be ""bo&sod"" while
Louise and I held high carnival
among dry goods. Dear little
Bvlle Raymond came and helped
us, and Willie seemed wonderful
ly attractive. The wedding oc
curred at Christmas, and Charlie
took our .""hired girl"" away to New
York, and I've not seen her sinco.
Willio and Belle are behaving
beautifully. I don't know what
will come out of it; bnt Belle is a

tho family, and, now that ho was old, was re­
tained for tbo good bo had done, and that ho
might have a homo In his declining years. At
ono time Mr. T. hod boon well off In tho world,
but unfortunate speculations in Wostom lands
had ruined him, and, at tho tlmo of which t
speak, bo had little loft besides a fow horses, a
wagon or two, and a dozen hood of cattle.
Near to whoro Mr. Thompson had sottlod on
tho Bluo, lived a wild young man who hod won
for himself thonamo of “ tho Wild Trappor of
the Bluo.” Ho lived all olono on tho head­
waters of a little crook, aud was rarely scon ex­
cept when ho camo, onco in every two or three
mouths, to tho traders to oxohango his furs and
skins for flour, tobacco, matches, col Too, and
such other articles as ho noodod. On those oc­
casions, aftor having mado his purchases, ho
would lounge about the traders for several days,
drinking bad whisky, and quarreling with ovory
ouo .ho could got to quarrel with him. When
under tho iiilluouco of whisky, ho would mount
his horse, and, with two largo uavy-rovolvors in
his holt, ndo up and down tbo village, defying
ovory ono to como out and fight him. For tbo
slightest offense, oithor real or imagined, ho
would llro at a man, and, if bo had a grudgo
against any ouo, that person's cattio or horsos woro
sure soon afterwards to bo missing. It was moro
than hinted that ho was tho principal or accom­
plice iu many of tho thefts, and, if ho woro so
minded, could teli whoro most-of tho valuable
horsosstoleu from timo to thuo outlie Balt Lake
stago-road had gono. Yot such was tho reputa­
tion of this young desperado for courngo and
wickedness that no ono carod to mcddlo with
him, aud, whorovor ho wont, his soci­
ety was tolerated rather than pre­
ferred. No ten men could havo
boon induced to go to his rancho to sooroli for
stolon stock, and so tho matter was allowed to
reßt,—ovory ouo blaming him with all sorts of
crimes, but no ono being able to swear tho sus­
picions woro correct.
Ouo evening, just as Air. Thompson aud his
family were sitting down, in tholr humble cabin,
to aßUpporofcorubrcadaudvonisou, a tall young
man, mounted on a wiry pony, rodo up. Ho was
scarcely 19 years of ago, and woro tho inevitable
leggings aud long frock of tho Western
hunters, ftingod with buckskin. His face was
brown as a nut, aud. whon iio raised the broad
brim of bis slouch hat, his countenance be­
trayed unmistakable signs of dissipation.
Mr. Thompson politely invited tho stranger to
dismount and partake of thoir frugal meal, aud,
springing from his horso, ho made httbto to ou­
ter: but, whou ho saw Alary, ho drow
back, blushed, aud would have mounted
again had not Mr. Thompson insisted
upon his stopping long enough to eat
something. It was not long before Air. Thomp­
son discovered from tho conversation tbat Ins
guest was uouo other than tbo famous young
desperado of tho Bluo, aud tbo discovery was
attoudod with considerable anxiety and alarm.
Tho quick evo of tbo huntor detected in an in­
stant tho alarm hie presence had created, and,
rising from tho table before ho had finished hiu
supper, ho said, with a dignified air:
“ I am iudeou tho Wild Trappor of tho Bluo,

and, liko every one olbo, you think mo bad; but
lam not ao Lad na they any. Oh! ”bo added,
after a moment's pause, “ if eomo ouo in the
world would only believe mo good, 1 might bo*
eomo liko other rnou.""

Then, fixing his piercing eyes on Mary, he
fazed at her a full minute, and, turning on his
eel. bo left the cabin without sayh'g another
word. Tho family, through tho opou doorway,
saw him swing his lithe body across his pony,
and gallop swiftly away over the prairie toward
his cabin.
From this visit Mr. Thompson .augured bad
luck; but, as day after day and week after week
passed and they saw no moro of him, they began
to think they had done tho young man an injus­
tice. True, they often heard of him in tho vil­
lage, whore ho continued his drinking and fight­
ing : but, although tho nearest way would have
led him by Mr. Thompson’s house, both in going
and coming, ho always crossed tho prairie some
miles above, and never came near the place.
Mr. Thompson, who had once boon a kind
husband, an indulgent father, and a man of
good habits, disappointed by repeated failures
in business, and vexed by poverty, had, of late
years, laimu to Ut aik, and now was little hotter
than a common drunkard. Ilia wife and daugh­
ter had persuaded him to move from lowa, hop­
ing, when ins old associations wore broken up,
be would do bettor in Nebraska, and make their
now borne a happy ouo. For a time their most
sanguine wishes seemed about to bo realized.
Tho farm they hud taken up was a good ouo, tho
crops wore abundant, and all scorned to promise
a happy future. Mr. Thompson had loft oft
drinking entirely, and was again tho kind and
affectionate husband and father of former years.

Tho happiness of this little family was unbound­
ed, when, in an ovil hour, a cloud dnrkonoji
tho bright sunshine of their rude cottage,
and finally burst iu a destroying storm.
A man named Cook opened a travelers' rancho,
or hotel, near Mr. Thompson's; aud between
this man and tho farmer there soon subsisted
tho warmest friendship. Night after night Mr.
Thompson would go to Cook’s, aud sit hi tho so­
ciety of bad men until tho small hours of tho
morning. Tho wife and daughter, alarmed for
bis safety, redoubled their efforts to make his
homo attractive, and icaorted to every womanly
device to keep him with them; but, despite their
exertions, ho s'pont moro than half his time at
Cook's.

For a long timo he restated every temptation
to drink 5 hut at length the evil of keeping Lad
company became apparent, and one night Mr.
Thompson came home -to his family reeling
drunk. His downward course was now rapid;
ho was drunk every day; and to the vice of
drinking ho soon added that of gambling. The
laud on which ho lived was a homestead, and
the title could not ho perfected for five years,
Bo ho could not gamble it awayj but, one by
one, the horses, cattle, and farming implements
wore put up and lost, until at last all that was
loft wore two horses, a wagon, and harness.
Among the persons who visited Cook’s was a
person culled Long Nod,—a fiaahily-dresacd In­
dividual, an ox-atago-dlivor, a drunkard, a gam­
bler, and an unpilnoiplod scoundrel. Ned hud
won most of Mr. Thompson’s stock and money,
and was now waiting to liuish up his devilish
work by taking the last thing the poor man
bad. Ho had not long to wait, for, one
evening, Thompson, with his . team and
wagon, camo over to tho rancho, and,
after sundry drinks had bcou taken,
Nod proposed to play for tho team and horses.
At first Thompson refused, saying it was all ho
hud loft, and ho meant to keep that; but a
drink or two moro, and tho exhibition by Nod of

Since the first well-defined suspicion of

typhoid fever, evidence has accumulated
which proves that the subject li one ol

In Leodt In Isolated placea, and in
districts where the sanitary condition waa
unexceptionable. The cause for this lor
a while completely baffled discovery; but
at length it wat found that a milk
dealer living in the centre of the
town supplied every bouse in which fever
was present. But the milk dealer got
his milk from a farmhouse some distance
away, and all within hit own boose were
well. Upon visiting the farmhouse six
persons were found suffering from the
disease, lying in a room adjoining that in
which the milk cant were kept, and
nursed by the same woman who managed
the dairy. Ol the eighty persona attacked
fourteen died. A dairyman in Glasgow,
having fever in hit house, supplied seventy-three
famlliet, living in five difierent
streets, and in these families thirty-six
cases of fever occurred.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026844/1873-10-10/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,wvu_belgium_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Wheeling daily intelligencer.,Campbell & M'Dermot,"Wheeling, W.

There is a voting lady living within a mile and
a quarter of Christiana, who is afflicted as singu­
larly as was the celebrated Alisa Godsey, tho
14 Sleeping Beauty,” For four years past sho
baa been suffering with.violent fainting spells,
that come on periodically, and are produced by
the strangling caused by some kind of reptile
which comes up in her throat. She is choked to
each an extent that her muscles become rigid,
her extremities cold, the pupils of her eyes
dilated and the skin breaks on her bands and
face, and she is, in all other particulars, through­
ly convulsed. She is only relieved by the reptile
itself being, as it is thought, partially choked,
withdrawing itself into the stomach.
The reptile bos at previous times been seen
by different persons. On one occasion a
Methodist preacher was visiting at the home
of her parents, when she was seized with one
of the usual attacks, and the parisitical object
even come out of her month and was grasped by
the minister. Being of a very superstitious
turn of mind, she had conceived the idea that
its death was her death, and refused to have it
removed, although that could at that time have
been easily accomplished. Tho minister
avowed that the reptile felt as cold and clammy
as any other snake, but chat it offered no par­
ticular resistance when ho clutched it with his
band. When it made its appearance outside
the mouth it curled its head rather under the
chin, but when let loose went immediately down
the young lady's throat again. It frequently
comes up into the mouth, and the young lady
says that whenever it does so it appears to lick
the roof of her mouth with its horrible tongue,
and then recedes again.
A neighboring physician has been attending
her during the period of her indisposition, and
has been treating her for tape-worms, believing
that to be the true malady. The symptoms are,
however, entirely different from those produced
by tape-worm. The girl still continues robust
instead of being emaciated, and the appetite,
instead of being ravenous, is fickle, at times
scarcely taking any food, while at other times
she has a very good appetite. The strongest
tape-worm remedies were used, but without any
effect whatever, and her physician, thinking tho
case hopeless, gave it up a short time ago, when
two others were called in, who aro using every
means in their power to effect a cure, with what
result remains to bo seen. The first step to he
taken was to disabuse her mind of tho supersti­
tions that had taken possession of it in re­
gard to her affliction. She has consented at last
to allow the monster to be removed if possible
and destroyed, as she is now convinced her life
depends upon it. The physicians in attendance
are anxiously awaiting au opportunity to affect
a removal, and are keeping constant watch for
the appearance of the reptile.
Alcohol has already, been prepared for its re­
ception, so that, when it shall be displaced, so
strange a phenomenon may be preserved.
The reptile, so far as has been ascertained, is
about half an inch in diameter, of a dark color
with a sort of hairy coating, but uo one is capa­
ble of judging of its length. It has never been
so closely scrutinized by any one as to tell
weather it lias eyes, but that, we believe,
is hardly possible. AU that is yet known of it is
that it freaueutly comes up into the mouth,
choaking the girl and throwing her into terrible
convulsions. It is attracting universal attention
about Christiana, and all the more so because
her life has been seriously threatened by the
peculiar movements of tne reptile.

—Friction of the body is one of the
gentlest and most useful kinds of exercise,
either by the hajuL piece of flannel, a
tolcrably cpMSedowel .or avflesh trush.
Friction cleans the skin, promotes per­
spiration and increases the war nth and
energy of the body. In rubbing the stom­
ach, perform the operation in a circular
direction, as that is most favorable to the
course of the intestines and their natural
action.
—Snow Pudding.—Pour one pint boil­
ing water on half a box of gelatine, add
the juice of one lemon, and two cups of
sugar. When nearly cold, strain, add the
whites of three eggs beaten to a froth,
then beat the whole well together and put
in a glass dish. Take the yolks of these
thretTeggs, one pint of milk, one teaspoon
corn-starch, flavor with vanilla, and cook
as you always do soft custard pour it
round the jellied part, or serve separately,
as you prefer.
—To Color Cotton Red.—Take muriate
of tin two-thirds ofa teacup add sufficient
water to coyer the goods well. Bring to
boiling'' l»eatf! jflitting In the goods one
houfr and Etirring often. Take out the
goods and empty the kettle and put in
clean water with Nicaragua wood, one
pound, steeping for half an hour at hand
heat then put in the goods and increase
the heat for one hour, not bringing it to a
boil at all. Air thfe* goods and dip as be­
fore. Wash without soap.
—Cure for Chilblains.—Bathe the feet
for half an hour in water as hot as can be
borne add hot water after the feet have
been in a few moments, as they will bear
more than at first. Let the water be at
least as hot when the feet are removed as
when put iri. This draws the inflamma­
tion out and allays the itching which is
so very painful. Dry with a cloth then
bathe well with hemlock oil (which can
be got at any druggist's at a trifling cost)
dry it in by the fire. Repeat, the applica­
tion three or four nights if heeded. Care

I —Save the tea leaves for a few days,
then steep them in a tin pail .or pan for
half an hpur, strain through a sieve and
use the tea to wash all varnished paint.

It requires very little ""elbow polish,"" as
the tea acts as a strong detergent, cleans­
ing the paint from all impurities, and
making the varnish equal to new. It
cleans window sashes and oil-cloths in­
deed, any varnished surface is improved by
its application. It washes window panes
and mirrors much better than water, and
is excellent for cleaning black walnut
picture and looking-glass frames. It will
not do to wash unvarnished paint with it.

When the feet beoome blistered from
walking too mnob, the fluid in the
blister may be let ont with a worsted
needle, leaving the worsted thread an
inch on eaoh aide through the blister,
and if muoh pain is caused, bathing the
feet in warm water will speedily give
the wished for relief ; but it should al­
ways be pnnoturod just before retiring
to rest. . ' '
To make a gallon of good ink take
one pound of gall-nuts, whioh bruise
and boil for an hour or two in a gallon
of water, then 6 oz. of gum, and 6 oc.
of green copperas (sulphate of iron),
separately dissolved in a little warm
water; this will turn a good oolor on ex­
posure to the air for a day or two and
oan then be bottled for use. Cost about
twenty oents.
To remove rust from steel, cover with
sweet oil well rubbed on.In forty-eight
hours use unslaoked lime, powdered
very fine. Bub it till the rust disap­
pears. To prevent rust, mix with fat
oil varnish four-fifths of well-rectified
spirits of turpentine. Apply the varnish
by means of a sponge. Articles var­
nished in this manner will retain their
brilliancy, and never contract any spots
of rust.
To restore linen that has long been
stained, rub the stains on each side with
wet brown soap. Mix some staroh to a
thiok paste with oold water, and spread
it over the soaped places ; then expose
the linen to the sun and air, and if the
stains have not disappeared in three or
four days, rub off the mixture, and re­
peat the process with fresh soap and
starch. Afterwards dry it ; wet it with
cold water, and put it into the wash.
Certain facts have been made known
whioh show that time is a good preserv­
er of timber. Ships and barges used
for the transport of lime last longer
than others. A small coasting schooner,
laden with lime, was cost ashore and
sank. She was raised and set afloat
once more, and remained sound for
thirty years. Again, a platform of nine
planks was used to mix water on during
three generations; then, being no longer
required, was neglected, ana at length
hidden by grass that grew over it. Sixty
years afterward, on clearing the ground:,
it was discovered sound and well pre­
served. '
Orchard and Nursery.
Muoh oan now be done towards ma?
king the orchard look well during the
summer. -
Washing and soraping can be carried
on when mild days oocur. A triangular
plate of iron attached to a handle three
feet in length makes a handy implement
for removing the loose bark from trees ;
the edges should be sharpened, but not
enough to injure the fresh bark. The'
best material for washing after the
trees have been scraped, is strong, soft
soap thinned with water, so as to be
conveniently applied by a brush ; a
solution of potash or soda will answer,
but soap is belter.
Manure. Draw out at any time when
convenient ; it is Better for the teams
to have something to do during the
winter. If loft in piles of sufficient
size in the field, fermentation will go on,
except when the weather is very oold.
See that plenty of absorbents are used
in the stables ; dry earth and leaves are
the best materials for this.
Planting. The time for planting
must be governed, of course, by the
looality ; in the Northern States two
months hence will be soon enough,
while at the Sonth a great deal will be
done thA present month. Nothing is
gained by too early planting ; better
wait until the ground is thoroughly
dry, as the trees cannot be injured if
properly heeled-in in a dry spot.
Varieties must be selected according
as they are intended for market or home
use. Spring is the time for tree agents
and peddlers to make their annual trips
through the country. Do not buy from
their showy colored pictures unless the
varities are known to be good, and even
then it is a better plan to visit a neigh­
boring nursery if there is suoh in the
vicinity, where the varieties are kept
true to name. There are agents who
are undoubtedly honest in their deal­
ings, but there are so many of the
other sort that it is hardly safe to trust
to them unless they are personally
known.
Insects A constant fight must be
kept upon the various inseots whioh in­
fest the orchard and nursery. Tent
caterpillars' eggs are easily seen now,
and oan be more readily removed than
it left until they hatch. The female
canker-worm will appear on mild days,
and ascend the trees to deposit her
eggs. There are many patents for pre­
venting the ascent, but anything fast­
ened around the tree which will serve
as a barrier, will be effective, whether
strips of paper covered with tar or
printer's ink, or troughs containing
petroleum.
Injured trees must be looked after,
and any limbs whioh have been broken
by wind or ice removed, after which let
the wound be carefully smoothed with
a sharp knife, and covered with liquid
grarang-wax, sneiiao varnisn, or com­
mon paint. If any trees have been
girdled by mioe. the bark mav be nni
ted by small twigs of the same kind
placed at short distances around the
trunk, so that the inner bark of the
tree is brought in contact with the in
ner bark of the twigs, both at the top
and bottom. Then a plaster of oow
aung ana loamy eartn snould be ap
plied, and the whole bandaged with i

tion of tho plant which is visible above
tbe soil is a bright, roey crimson in
color, and presents tbe very strongest
contrast to tbe dark green of the pines
and the shimmer of the snow. Its root
is succulent, thick, and abundantly free
of moisture, attaching itself to tbe roots
of other plants, principally to the spe­
cies of the pine family. Hence it is
among thpse curious members of the
vegetable world which are known to
botanists as parasites, and is, conse­
quently, entirely incapable of cultiva­
tion. The deer are extremely fond of
it, and it is not an uncommon circum­
stance to find a number of the plants
uprooted and robbed of the fleshy part
ot their underground growth by these
animals. It belong! to the natural order
Orobanchacea, and ia met with through
the whole of the Sierra region, becoming
rarer as we approach the south.

how HE got AW AT.
The apartments occupied by Marshal Bazaine
opened upon a terrace, which was built
upon a lofty and precipitous cliff overhanging
the sea. A sentry was posted on the terrace,
with orders to watch the prisoner's every
movement
During Sunday evening the Marshal walked
npon the terrace with Colonel Yillette, his aid-de-camp.
At ten o'clock he retired as usual,
, -apparently to Bleep, but before daybreak he
liad effected his escape.

reached the edge of the precipice. Thence,
by means of a knotted rope, he descended to
the sea. He evidently slipped daring the
descent and tore his hands, as the rope was
found stained with blood in several places.
THE LOVE AND TOIL or A FAITHFUL WIFE.
Under the cliff, in a hired boat, were
Bazaine's wife and cousin.
They received him as he reached the water,
and Madame la Mar?chale, taking the oars
herself, rowed directly to a strange steamer,
whioh had been lying off the island since the
previous evening.
ON BOABD A STEAMSHIP AND AWAY TO SEA.
They reached the vessel in safety, were
taken on board, and the Bteamer then put to
sea.
It is thought that they have landed at
Genoa as the steamer proceeded in that
direction.
CITIZEN EXCITEMENT AND AN ABBE8T.
The first news of the aflair came to Grasse,
the nearest place on the coast, and the magis
txates of the town immediately sent officers in
every direction to search for the fugitives.
There was great commotion in Marseilles
-when the facts became known. An investigation
was opened. Colonel Villette, who was
walking with the Marshal on the evening of
his escape, was discovered there and imprisoned.
The commandant ot the fort of Stc. Mar­

guarite was placed under arrest and General
Sewal has gone to the island to investigate
the aflair.

ately and positively injurious, as in

by the people on f l.cnrst trial as misera­
ble, danserous and wicked humbugs
Whereas, it is a well-known fact that
all ray medicines enjoy the reputation,

cacious but perfectly mild, pleasant
and harmless in effects. Notwithstand­
ing, however, that the bogus receipts
were so ridiculously preposterous as
scarcely 'to have beeu believed by the
most unscientific, thoughtless and un­
suspecting people, yet strange aud in­
credible as it .may seem, a paper of high
scientific- pretensions, published in this

On mv attentiou being called to the

if uncontradicted, would imply, I, as
proprietor and manufacturer of - the
aforesaid celebrated medicines, went be
fore a magistrate and made oath to the
fact that the said receipts were utterly
false. Mv affidavit was sent to the pub
lishers of the paper into which the bo­
gus receipts had been copied, and in a
subsequent Issue an editorial notice was
given of my denial. But, notwith­
standing such correction and denial,
made under oath, certain' individuals,
who lounsre around and infest our large
cities, gaining a livelihood by penetra­
ting all kinds of catch-penny frauds
upon the credulous, were ttiereDy given
the hint that, as my medicines were
universally popular, by advertising for
sale bogus receipts for making them,
they could get lots of ignorant people
to bite at their bait. One Frank M.
Reed, of 139 Eighth street, New York,
who publishes ""Love ana tourtsnip
Cards,"" a ""Fortune Teller aud Dream
Book."" ""The Mister ies of Love Making,""
""How to Woo and How to Win,"" and
various other swindles, sends his dupes.
the following in exchange for their
stamps. It is copied from the papers
alluded to and is as follows: ""For Dr.
Saae's Catarrh Remedy take eight grains
Carbolic Acid, seven grains of Camphor,
and two and a half grains ot- common
Salt, the whole to be covered with a lit­
tle Prussian blue."" This makes a pow
erful caustic mixture as unlike Dr.
Sage's Cartarrh Remedy (which is per­
fectly unirritating, mild, soothing aud
pleasant) as light is from darkness. As
""a burnt child dreads the fire,"" if any
have been So foolish as to have burned
their noses sore with this caustic com­
pound, thinking that they were using
the same as Dr. Sage's celebrated Catarrh
Remedy, they will, it is to be hoped,
profit bv the lesson thereby taught tnem
and not be so ready next time to bite
at every catch-penny advertising dodge
that swindlers may oner. tnem. tor
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
the bogus receipt reads: ""Take four
drachms purified Honey, fifteen grains
extract poisonous Lettuce, thirty grains
of Opium, three and' a fourth ounces
dilute Spirits, three ounces water. Mix.""
Of this ridiculous bogus formula I will
sav, as I did under oath, not one of the
medicinal or poisonous ingredients therein
given enters into the composition of my
Golden Medical Discovery i And further­
more, I will say that I defy all the
chemists in the world to ascertain, by
chemical analysis, the composition of
any of my Family Medicines, as they
cannot be analyzed so as to determine
their ingredients, many of which are
new in mediciue, and, like nearly all
vegetable extracts, there are no known
reagents or chemical test3 by which
their presence can be determined. If
any further proof is wanted to satisfy
any person that the receipt given above
Is utterly false, let that person have the
mixture, as given, compounded, and,
not only will it be seen to be eutirely
unlike my Discovery in appearance, but
if a further test is wanted, by taking a
dose of it it will be found to produce
drowsiness and stupor, whereas my Dis­
covery, in ever so targe doses, produces
no such effect. Others, located in dif­
ferent cities and engaged iu advertising
for sale bogus receipts for making my
medicines, send those that bite at their
bait other and various ridiculous for­
mulae. One sent out by a villainous
knave, located in Chicago, gives the
chief ingredient of Dr. Sage's Catarrh
Remedy as being Blue Vitriol, which is
ouly equaled in absurdity by another
issued by parties iu Philadelphia, who
say that the ingredients composing' Dr.
Sage's Catarrh Remedy are ""burnt
Alum, white Vitriol, Sugar of Lead,
and Prussiate of Iron,"" and that my
Golden Medical Discovery is ""simply
Syrup and tincture of Ginger."" In refu­
tation of all the various and ridiculous
bogus receipts for making my medicines
that have ever been, or may hereafter
be published aud circulated, I would
say that I have, in dealing with the peo
ple, ever been governed Dy tne maxim
that ""honesty is the best policy,"" and
that 'success makes success;"" for it is
because some sufferer has obtained re
lief or cure, that that suflerer has sent
another to me; and It is because thou
sands have been cured that they have
recommended me and my superior reme­
dies to other thousands of sufferers. In
this way I am constantly making living
advertisements for myself and medi­
cines. It is a common thing to hear
people say that plenty of advertising
will make a success out of anything,
whether it has any merit or not. Xotu­
insr could be farther from the truth. It
is with this delusive idea actuating them
that thousands have rushed headlong
into advertising, only to find themselves
bankrupt in a little while. Xot more
than one in five hundred who engages
in advertising medicines ever makes a
financial success out of the undertak­
ing, for the reason that a medicine to be
successful must possess unusual and ex­
traordinary merit. It is not enough
that it should be h remedy of fair effi­
cacy ; it must possess superior and won­
derful remedial properties, for if it does
not, those who -use it with the most
sanguine expectations will condemn it.
They will expect much of it, and it
must be equal to the test, or It will
prove ruinous to the proprietor. For,
although a great display of advertising

will,- many times, create a considerable
immediate demand for the article adver­
tised, yet if that article does not pos­
sess real merit, the demand will be only
temporary; the fraud will be detected,
aud the reaction will upset the proprie­
tor and all his high expectations, long
before he is able to recover the amount
of money already expended. With this
view of the subject, I have felt warrant­
ed in contracting for hundreds of thou­
sands of dollars worth of advertising in
the newspapers of this aud other coun­
tries, feeling perfectly assured that the
merits of my remedies were so great as
to insure a financial success out of such
a bold undertaking. And in this I have
not been disappointed, tor my sales have
increased steadily year after year, until
they w ill this year"" largely exceed half a
million dollars worth of my medicines.
This grand success, I am certain, could
never have been attained had the medi­
cines not possessed superior and won­
derful merits.
The Toledo Blade, in an editorial arti­
cle, has truly said, alluding to my busi­
ness, that ""great success is never achie­
ved without merit. An article that
holds the field year after year, and the
sales of which increase regularly and
rapidly, must have absolute merit.""
The article continues: ""Dr. R. V.
Pierce, of Buffalo, N. T., occupies our
entire eighth page to-day with his vari­
ous articles. We admit it because we
know the Doctor, and know of his arti
cles. We know him to be a regularly
educated physician, whose diploma
hangs on the wall of his office, and we
know that he has associated with him

they have efl'ected, has demonstrated the fact that rup­
ture can be surely cured Without suffering or annoy­
ance, and without the danger of incurring Spinal Dim-,
ease or Paralysis, often caused by the severe pressure
of Metal Trusses ami Supporters. It is the only sure
cure for Hernia, as it Is the only Truss In use that will
hold the rupture securely in all positions in which the
body can be placed. It will perforin radical cures
when all others fail. It can be worn with ease and
comfort when no spring truss can be used. When
once adjusted, no mation of the body or accident can
displace it. These instruments have the unqualified
approval of tht most eminent practitioners in the pro­

“After the experience of months, patients testify
strongly to Its efficacy, as well as to the ease and free­

Dear Sir—After suffering for thirty years, in my own
person, from the use of every form of Metallic Truss
procurable in this country and in Europe, I, two Years
ago, applied your Elastic Truss, and since that time I
have experienced comfort and satisfaction, and been
taught the truth, that the Elastic Truss is the only In­
strument that should be used for the relief and cure of
Hernia; and now, after more than thirty years’ con­
tinuous practice, and having adjusted many hundreds
of Trusses (and for the last twenty months yours ex­
clusively), I gratefully declare it to be my deliberate
opinion that your Elastic Truss is the only one enti­
tled to the confidence of t he public; that elasticity is
the only power at all adapted to the requirements of a
Truss or Supporter, and am convinced that your Elas­
tic Truss actually cures a large proportion of all cases
to which it is applied, not only among children, hut in
numerous cases within my own knowledge of patients
from 50 to7syears of age. H. BURNHAM, M. D.,

Trusses, which some parties advsertise and sell, fraud­

To the Suffering.—An old retired
physician, who is candid enough to tel!
the truth about progress, has declared
that the recent discovery by Dr.
Walker, of California, of his herb
remedy, Vinegar Bitters, is one of the
most important in medicine. He has
tested them thoroughly, in his own
family, among his friends, and upon
himself; and he is driven to the con­
clusion that they possess rare and un­
excelled curative properties. He says
of them : “They contain no dangerous
drug. They never reduce the patient—
never render one liable to take cold—
never interfere with the every day busi­
ness of life—never make their continu­
ous use a condition of cure, and are
adapted to even the most delicate or­
ganization. They act as kiudlv on the
tender infant, the delicate female, oriu­
firra old age, as on the vigorous and
athletic system ; exercising healthful
effects upon every blood vessel—on the
brain, nerves and lymphatics—on the
Blood. Bile, Gastric Juice, etc., en­
riching impoverished fluids, and impart­
ing vigor to mind and body—Com.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85040344/1875-02-27/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,whi_florence_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Superior times.,Superior Times Printing,"Superior, Wis.","","",9302,7682,2670,4299,3,22275,29862,0,whi_florence_ver01/data/sn85040344/00271769283/1875022701/0429.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Superior%2C_Wisconsin,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/whi_florence_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85040344%2F00271769283%2F1875022701%2F0429.jp2/pct:41.759820,25.725002,11.986532,14.396223/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/whi_florence_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85040344%2F00271769283%2F1875022701%2F0429.jp2/pct:41.759820,25.725002,11.986532,14.396223/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

The postmaster of Monticello, Geor­
gia, recently performed the feat of
reading a letter without hearing its
contents. An old woman who had
never been to school got u letter one
day, and asked the postmaster to read
it for her. She did not want him to
hear it, so she took a wad of cotton
out of her pocket and stuffed his ears
with It. She then had him read the
letter in a low voice, and was perfectly
satisfied that the reader could not hear
a word of it. This is reported as a late
actual occurrence. ,","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033437/1875-04-28/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,tu_jimmy_ver02,"","","",true,ca,Knoxville daily chronicle.,Rule & Tarwater,"Knoxville, Tenn.","","",2780,22332,3432,2492,4,30064,37892,4,tu_jimmy_ver02/data/sn85033437/00296021003/1875042801/0032.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knoxville%2C_Tennessee,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/tu_jimmy_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn85033437%2F00296021003%2F1875042801%2F0032.jp2/pct:9.246940,58.935923,11.415647,6.576586/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/tu_jimmy_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn85033437%2F00296021003%2F1875042801%2F0032.jp2/pct:9.246940,58.935923,11.415647,6.576586/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

And ladies beautiful, with plume and zone,
But they were stone; their hearts within were
stone;
And the vast hall was filled in every part
With silent crowds, ttony in face a id heart.
Long at the scene, bewildered ami amazed,
The trembling clerk m speechless wonder gu/eJ .
Then from the table, by his greed made bold.
He seized a goblet and a knife of gold,
And suddenly from their seats the guests upspraug,
The vaulted ceiling wiih loud clamors rang.
The archer sped his arrow, at their call,
bhatleriug the lambent jewel on the w all,
And all was dark ursuud and overhead
Stark on the floor the luckless clerk lay dead !
The writer of this legend then records
Its ghostly application in these words:
The image is the Adversary old,
Whose beckoning linger point* to realms of gold;
Our mats and passions are the downward stair
’That leads the sou! from a diviner air;
The archer, Death; the flaming jewel, Life;
Terrestrial good-, the goblet aim the knife;
The knights and ladies, all whose flesh and bone
By avarice Lave been hardened into stone;
Tho clerk, the scholar whom the love of pelf
Tempts from his books and irom his nobler tell.
The scholar and the world ! T he endless strife,
The discord in the harmonies of life!
The love of learning, the sequestered uook-,
And all tne sweet serenity of books;
The market place, the love of gain,
Whose aim is vanity, and whose eml is pain !
But why, you ask me, should this tale be told
To men grown old, < r who are growing old ?
It is too late ! Ah, nothing is too late
Till the tired heart shall cease to palpitate.
Cato learned Greek at eighty; Sophocles
Wrote his grand (Edipus, and Simonides
Bore oil the prize of verse irom hi* compeers,
When each had nnmbeied more than louiacore
years;
And Theophrastus, at fourscore and ten,
Had but begun bis Characters of Men.
Chaucer, at Woodstock with the nightingales,
At sixty wrote the Canterbury Tales;
Goethe at Weimar, toiling to the last,
Completed Faust when eighty years were past.
These are indeed exceptions ; but they show
How lar the Gulf stream ol our youth may flow
Into the arctic legions of our lives,
Where little else than life itself survives.
As the barometer foretells the storm
While still the skies are clear, the weather warm,
So something in us, as old age draws near,
Betrays the pressure of the atmosphere.
The nimble mercury, ere we are aware,
Descends the elastic ladder of the air;
The telltale blood in artery and in vein
Sinks from its higher levels in the brain ;

? Twelfth Niyht.
If, when you hear a corUin lady's name,
You feel your pulses give a sudden start,
Or blush, as if some secret sense oi shame
Had stirred, just then, the currents of your
heart;
And if that name?to put it rather strong?
In euphony seems very much above
All other names?1 think I can't bo wrong,
To veature the opinion, you're in love I
If, when at last, by some Auspicious chance,
You meet the lady at a ball or play,
You shrink abashed before her mode t glance,
And quite forget the words you meant to say ;
And if, moreover, gazing at her hund.
You wish upon that hand you were a glove,
It isn't very hard to understand
(See ""Komeo and Juliet"")you're in love !
If with two ladies, on a summor's day,
You sit alono, at luncheon' or at tea,
And think, if ont of them wero but away
(A. mile or so) how bappy you would be;
Yet find your wits in such a giddy whirl,
You scarcoly speak to her you've thinking of,
But prattle gayly with the other girl?
There's rtnson for supposing you're in love!
If, all at once, your amatory pen
(Which ne'er before attempted lyric lines,
Invito, musa?bane of gods and men I)
To tervid song and madrigal inclines,
""Wherein you rashly rhyme of ""youth"" and
truth,""
And call your subject ""darling,"" ""duck,"" or
""dove;""
Or sadly beg some cruel lady's ruth?
The symptom is unfailing?you're in love 1
If of her sex no other you can find
One half so bright or beautiful a?she;
If to her failings you aro wholly blind

Mr. Ned Harris, who lives on the Buch­
anan and Peaks of OtteriTurnpike. tells
this story: He says the night lieforc the
freer.e in April last, that he hungaeveral
pieces of old iron in ten (10)ol his beaca
trees, and that the fruit was not killed,
and that those trees are now loaded with
peaches, and he thinks there will not be
less than seventy-five bushels. The fruit
of the remaining trees, (15 in number)
in the orchard, were all killed- A piece
of horse shoe was hung in a cherry tree
In the same orchard, and it was loaded
with fruit, whilst on three adjacenttrees
the fruit was entirely killed. He says
the idea originated with his mother,
and that he by her instructions, when a
boy, had done the same thing frequent­
ly, with similar results.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033681/1875-08-25/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,tu_hubert_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Morristown gazette.,"L.P. & G.E.

A Shrewd Woman.?The Liverpool Steam
'acket Company, wishing to extend its premies,
decided to purchase adjoining land,
phich was owned by a maiden lady of unertain
age. The lady sold the land cheap,
iut caused to be inserted in the agreement
an article to this effect, that during her
ifetime she and a lady companion should
iave the privilege of traveling free in any of
he company's vessels.
The day after the agreement was signed, she
old her house and furniture, and, bavtig
found a companion, went on board one of
he company's steamers, just about to sail for
iouth America ; and from that time to this
he has lived at sea and at the company's excuse.
She advertises for some lady who
pishes to make the voyage as her companion,
nd who pays her fare, and in this way, it is
aid, has already accumulated about ten
housand dollars. The compauy have offer*
d her more than this to cancel the agreement.
This she refused to do, and as the life
t sea suits her health remarkably, there is no

rospect that her voyaging will soon come to
n end.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026925/1875-10-21/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,scu_chitlinstrut_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Yorkville enquirer.,"","Yorkville, S.C.","","",19523,26486,3366,4315,1,23085,33441,0,scu_chitlinstrut_ver01/data/sn84026925/00295862750/1875102101/0385.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/York%2C_South_Carolina,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/scu_chitlinstrut_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84026925%2F00295862750%2F1875102101%2F0385.jp2/pct:84.570067,79.202177,14.580897,12.903322/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/scu_chitlinstrut_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84026925%2F00295862750%2F1875102101%2F0385.jp2/pct:84.570067,79.202177,14.580897,12.903322/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

It was no common foe they had to fight,
no enemy easy to overcome; it was a party
controlling the sword and puree of the
country, and no conscience to restrain it

Beautiful Women that no Longer Kule
iu WaBbington.
From the Independent.
One year ago Mn. Belkuap was the
toast. Every night aod every morning
we read aoew of the brightness of her
face, the ruarvelsof her drepses, the num­
ber of her shoes. She read so much about
the splendors of her beauty aad the won­
ders of her toilet that she grew to beiieve
herself to be a tittle above auy of her
earthly sisters. In three years she was
utterly transformed from aRentle.subdued­
looking widow to an airy, supercilious
woman of fashion.
When Senator Christiancy married a
little girl who counted scrip in the treas­
ury, tbe society ""leaders"" met and debated
whether they should receive her or not
She entered their enchanted circle ns if
by fire. She was bv uo means unanimous
iy received, nor in any way warinlv wel-
uonied. Nobody tabooed her so nositivp.lv
and utterly as Mrs. BelknaD. She. the.
daughter of a country doctor, was not will
ne to receive on equal terms the littlp
""Countess"" of ""Scrip,"" suddenly elevated
to the dignity of a senator's -wife. That
was but one year ago.
Yet already we have ceased altogether
tc hear of Mrs. Belknap's dresses. She
lives at the Arlington, and no doubt
keeps still her near personal friends; but
he is no longer the fabhion. Nobodv
cares whether her shoes are ones or tetis.
just the same the gay throng rolls un
to the door of the secretary of war; but
his Dame is Don Cameron. Fie has a
daughter, tall, strong, dark and beautiful.
She now is the toast. So also is the
daughter-in-law of the attorney general,
the bride of a week. She is a blond of
blonds -blue-eyed and iove.lv in an azure
dress. The whole world of fashion is
rushing to gaze upon her at the Kbbitt
House. JLvery week we read that the
most brilliant receptions of the season are
those ot Mrs. Taft.
It seems but yesterday that the whole !
world was flowing iaro the house of the i
attorney general whose name was Will- j
iams. What suuiptuous feasts were those
in the new house into which the beautiful I
woman had put her very life. Amid '
costly hangings and azure satin furniture, i
dressed like a Peri, this beautiful sultana
stirred her famous aud fragrant ""punch""
tor tne ieastmg and dancing crowds who j
packed her house. She stirs it still in the
same house, no doubt, for her individual 1
friends; but the crowds for the attornev
general's all rush to the Ebbitt House, and
Mrs. Talt answers just as well as Mrs.

As the trials of life thicken and the
dreams of other davs fade, one bv one

in the deep vista of disappointed hope, the
heart grows weary of the struggles, and we
begin to realize our insignificance. Those
who have climbed to the pinnacle of fame,
or revel in luxury and wealth, go to the
grave at last with the poor mendicant who
begs pennies by the wayside, and like him
are soon forgotten. Generations after gen­
erations, says an eloquent modern writer,
have felt as we feel, aud their fellows were
as active in life as ours are now. They
passed away as vapor, while Nature wore
the same aspect of beauty as her Creator
commanded her to do. And so, likewise,
shall it be when we are gone. The heavens
will be as bright over our graves as they
are now around our path; the world will
have the same attractions for offsprings yet
unborn that she had once for our children.
Yet a little while and all this will have hap­
pened. Days will continue to move on, and
laughter aud song will be heard in every
chamber in which we died; aud the eye that
mourned for us will be dried, and will glisten
with joy, and even our children will cease
to think of us, and will not remember to
lisp our names.—Goodrich.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83032103/1877-07-05/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,njr_juniper_ver01,"","","",true,ca,West-Jersey pioneer.,[James B.

Parson Jedediah Dewey, who preached
war sermon the Sunday before the battle o
Bennington, was the first pastor of the firs
church in Vermont. His strict theologies
views sometimes brought him into contac
with Col. Ethan Allen, the hero of Ticon
deroga, who lived in Bennington sonn
years. Preaching on the character of Goi
one Sunday, Col. Allen rose in his promi
nent pew and disputed"" one of the Parson’
statements. Pointing at the disturber, Mr
Dewey retorted: “Sit down, thou boh
blasphemer, and listen to the Word of God.’
During the Thanksgiving service for tin
surrender of Ticonderoga, Mr. Dewey ha(
been ascribing the glory of the victory t<
the Lord rather more sweepingly than wa

midst of a prayer, “Please mention to tin

Mr. Jasper Throckmorton, who lives out on
Summer street, Is the lather of ten children.
Yesterday morning Mr. Throckmorton was Just
on the point of putting on his hat to start for
the ulliec,.whca Mrs. Throckmorton called after
him from the kitchen: .

“Stop at Soddcr’s and tell him to come up
and llx tnc water pine, and get a big tin dipper
and bring it with you this nnon. Don't tell
thci» to semi (t, they'll forget it.""
Mr. Throckmorton said ho would, and then he
put on his hat and started. As he reached the
front door his oldest daughter shouted from up­
stairs:

“Pal pat t pat It Go to Qreouhaum it
Schroder's and oak Mr. Scott to give you two
yards and a half of brown satin, cut on the bias,
to match the dress 1 got last week; he’ll know
the kind. Bring It with you. I don't want to
wait for It.”

And Mr. Throckmorton pausing with his hand
on the door said he would get it. and then
sighed and opened the door, dust then his old­
est son shouted from the sitting-room:
“ Father I the man was up hero twice yester­
day for the money for my new boat, and I Just
gave him a note to you, and he'll coll at the
unice to-dav for his moncr, and will give vou a
pair o( patent oarlocks and a dlpnet. Bring
them up with you when you come to dinner.""
Mr. Throckmorton kind of stilted a groan like,
and, saying he would attend to It, went out. As
lie passed down the porch steps his second
daughter leaned out of a window and cried:
“O pa, do stop at Parsons' us yon come to
dinner aud tell them to sends man to lay the
new hall carpet when they send It up. sud you
getteu pounds of cotton-batting, and bring It
up with you, for we waolltrignt away and can’t
wait.""

The parent paused with his hand on the gate­
latch. and with a risible cfTorl promised to re­
member the orraud and brine up the cotton­
batting, and opened the gate. But the mice of
His younger sou from the side-yard caught his
ear and held him for a moment:

“l’ap,o papt Want ten cents to par for a
window I broke in the school-house and 1 can’t
go to Sunday-school till 1 get a new hat and
shoes, and please can't I hare a quarter to go to
the plcnlcl”
Mr. Throckmorton silently registered a flog­
ging fur the broken glass, a negative for picnic,
amf said be would get the boots and hat. Then
he turned to go, but as he passed down the
street his six younger children came running
after him:

“ O dt. don't forget to stop and see If the old
umbrella's fixed, ma savs.""
“Stop at the dentist's and see when ho can
All my teeth.”
“Bring my shoes homo from the shoe­
maker’s.”

“ Ma says ho sure and tell the Doctor to come
upJUMlay and vaccinate the baby I ”
,cl*ap{ Kin I go awlmmin* in Ilawkeyo krlck,
to-nlglitt”
“Pa, O pa! gimme Are cents to ride on the
street cars 1 ”

And Mr. Throckmorton went down town ond
amazed Fred Scott by telling h!m to cut him off
about thirteen leet of water-pipe, on the bias,
and he asked Mr. Parsons to let him have siev­
ing dozing skeins of cottlng-hattlng, and send
him up a man with a tin dipper; ho told Dr.
Cochran, tho dentist, to come right np and till
the baby's teeth, and begged the Doctor to
hurry right away, and put a half-sole on the
school-house window, and then ho ran to the
shoemaKer’s. and asked him if be bad vaccinated
his little girl’s shoe, and amazed a street-car
driver br asking him for a bath ticket, and when
tho min came around with tho oarlocks and
dipaci, bo told him to take them up and lay
them in the front ball, tho girls would show
him where. And by U o’clock In the afternoon
it had got all around town that old Mr. Throck­
morton was drinking aa bad as ever ogaiu, and
hadn't drawn a sober breath all day.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84031492/1877-08-06/ed-1/seq-8,"","",8,"","",1,dlc_jefferson_ver02,"","","",true,ca,Chicago daily tribune.,"","Chicago, Ill.","","",10857,7087,2017,7436,8,15280,20024,0,dlc_jefferson_ver02/data/sn84031492/no_reel/1877080601/0008.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_jefferson_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn84031492%2Fno_reel%2F1877080601%2F0008.jp2/pct:71.053665,35.392529,13.200262,37.135437/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_jefferson_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn84031492%2Fno_reel%2F1877080601%2F0008.jp2/pct:71.053665,35.392529,13.200262,37.135437/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Geraniums wiu. Drive Off Snakes.?
Every species of snake may be permanently
driven away from an in Tested place by plant­
ing geraniums. In South Africa the Caflir
people thus rid their premises of snakes. A
missionary of South Africa had his parson­
age surrounded by a narrow belt of gera­
niums, which effectually protected the resi­
dence from any kind of snake. A few
yards away from this geranium belt a snake
would occasionally be found. It is well
known that the whole geranium genus is
highly redolent of volatile oils? lemon­
scented, musk-scented, and peppermint­
scented. What, therefore, is a very pleasant
nosegay for man is repugnant to the ser­
pent tribe.? Central Presbyterian.

What Agriculture Does.?Without
agriculture there is uo wealth. Gold aud
silver are not wealth?they are its con?
venient representatives; commerce pro?
duces no wealth?it simply exchanges it;
manufacture and the arts combine it.
Agriculture is the prolific mother of
wealth?the rest simply handle it when
produced and delivered into their hands.
The earth breeds savages. Agricul?
ture breeds enlightened nations; it
breeds houses and ships, temples and
seminaries; it breeds the manufactory;
sculpture, painting and music are its off?
spring. The wheels of the work-shops,
the sails of commerce, the implements of
science, the pen of genius, the pencil and
chisel of the artist, the eloquent tongue
of the orator, the scheming brain of the
statesman, the equipages of wealth,-the
banquetings of pleasure?all that renders
earth in its tides of life anything but a
reat sepulchre, move and have power of
eing, because the fields yield their fruits
to the patient toil of the husbandman.
We might manage to live without mer?
chants, wi th out mari ners, wi thou t orators,
without poets; perhaps we might sur?
vive the loss of demagogues?but sure I
am we could not live without plowmen.
The state of husbandry in any country
is the best test of its enlightenment. The
thermometer of civilization rises or falls
as drives the plow. ""You must send the
plow,"" exclaimed a man who had trav?
eled all over Christian missionary ground,
""in heathen lands; a barbarian, nation
needs but to be plowed up deep, sub­
soiled, planted, and the inevitable har?
vest will bean enlightened nation.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026965/1877-11-01/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,scu_carlacox_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Anderson intelligencer.,J.C.C.

A Campaign Slander.
When Dr. R. V. Pierce was a can­
didate for State Senator, his political
opponents published a pretended anal­
ysis of his popular medicines, hoping
thereby to prejudice the people
against him. liis election by an ov­
erwhelming majority severely rebuk­
ed his traducers, who sought to im­
peach his business integrity. No no­
tice would have been taken of these
campaign lies were it not that some
of his enemies (and every successful
business man has his full quota of en­
vious rivals) are republishing these
bogus analyses. Numerous and most
absurd formulas have been published,
purporting to come from high au­
thority and it is a significant fact that
no two have been at all alike—conclu­
sively proving the dishonesty of their
authors.

The following is from I he Buffalo
Commercial, of Oct. 23d, 1877
""Hardly a dozen years ago he (Dr.
Pierce) came here, a young and un­
known man, almost friendless, with
no capital except his own manhood,
which, however, included plenty of
brains and pluck, indomitable perse­
verance, and inborn uprightness
Capital enough for any young man,
in this progressive country, if only he
has good health and habits as well.
He had all these great natural advan­
tages and one thing more, an excel­
lent education. He had studied med­
icine and been regularly licensed to
practice as a physician. But he was
still a student, fond of investigation
and experiment. He discovered, or
invented, important remedial agen­
cies or compounds. Not choosing to
wait wearily for the sick and su tier­
ing to find out (without any body to
tell them) that he could do them good,
he advertised his medicines and invi­
ted the whole profession of every
school, to examine and pronounce
judgment upon his formulas. He ad­
vertised liberally, profusely, but with
extraordinary shrewdness, and with
a method which is in itself a lesson to
all who seek business by that perfect­
ly legitimate means. His success has
been something marvelous—so great
indeed that it must be due to intrin­
sic merit in the articles he sells more
even than to his unparalleled skill in
the use of printer's ink. The present
writer once asked a distinguished
dispensing druggist to explain the se­
cret of the almost universal demand
for Dr. Pierce's medicines. He said
they were in fact genuine medicines,
—such compounds as every good
physician would prescribe, for the
diseases which they were advertised
to cure. Of course, they cost less than
any druggist would charge for the
same article supplied on a physician's
prescription, and besides there waB
the doctor's feo saved. Moreover,
buying the drugs in such enormous
quantities, having perfect apparatus
for purifying and compounding the
mixture, he conld not only get","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92056106/1878-01-09/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,iahi_jigglypuff_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Ottumwa weekly courier.,"A.H.

at forest planting that several foreign govern­

new trade from this country. An export of
forest tree seeds from California has been es­
tablished. amounting to $10,000 worth psr year.
The principal purchases are made for tier­
many, Austria, England, aud the colonies in
Australia and New Zealand: at present the
demand exceeds the supply. The seeds of
the Oregon pine, known a?o as the yellow fir,
are most sought; the timber of that tree is as
good as British oak for ship building, and has
been found sound after eighteen years' use
for this purpose. The South sea colonies are

It was a vast silence of pines, redolent with
balsamic breath, and muffled with the dry dust
of dead bark and matted mosses. Lying on
our backs, we looked upward through a hun­
dred feet of dear, unbroken interval to the
first lateral branches that formed the flat canopy
above us. Here and there the fierce sun, from
whose active persecution we had just escaped,
searched for us through the woods, but its keen
blade was dulled and turned aside bv Intercostal
boughs, and its brightness dissipated in nebu­
lous mists throughout the roofing of the dim
brown aisles around us. AVc were in another
atmosphere, under another sky, indeed in an­
other world than the dazzling one we had just
quitted. The crave silence seemed so much a
part of the grateful coolness that wc hesitated

to speak, and for some moments lay quietly
outstretched on the smc tassels where we hud
first thrown ourselves. Finally, a voice broke
the silence. »
“Ask the old Major; he knows all about it!”

The person here alluded to, under that mili­
tary title, was myself. I hardly need explain to
any Californian that it by no means followed
that Iwas a “Major,”, or that I was “old,” or
that I knew anything about “ it,” or indeed
what “it” referred to. The whole remark was
merely jmo of the usual conventional feelers
to conversation—a kind of social preamble,
quite common to our slangy camp Intercourse.
Nevertheless, as T was always known as the
Major, perhaps for no better reason than that
the speaker, an old journalist, was always called
Docteir, I recognized the fact so far as to kick
aside an intervening saddle so that I could see
the speaker’s face on a level ’with my own, and
said nothing.
“About Ghosts,” said the Doctor, after a
pause, which nobody broke or was expected to
break. “Ghosts! sir. That’s what we want to
know. What are we doing here in this blank
old mausoleum of Calaveras County—-If it isn’t
to find out something about ’em, ehl ”
Nobody replied.
“Thar’s that haunted house at Cave City.
Can’t be more than a mile or two away, any
how, Used to be just off the trail.”
A dead silence.

The Doctor (addressing space generally)—
‘‘Yes, sir; it tea* a mighty queer story.”
Still the same reposeful Indifference. We all
knew the Doctor’s skill as a raconteur;' we all
knew that a story was coming: ; and we all knew
that any interruption would be fatal. Time and
time again, in our prospecting experience, had a
word of polite encouragement, a*rash expres­
sion of interest, even a too eager attitude of si-

lent expectancy, brought the Doctor to a sud­
den change of subject; time and time again
had wc seen the unwary stranger stand amazed

and bewildered between our own indifference
and the sudden termination of a promising
anecdote, through his own unlucky interfer­
ence. So wc said nothing. “ The Judge ”—an­
other instance of arbitrary nomenclature—pre­
tended to sleep. Jack began to twist a cigarrlto.
Thornton bit off the cuds of pine-needles re­
flectively.

“ Vesj sir,” continued the Doctor, coolly, rest­
ing the buck of his head ou the palms of his
hands, uit ioos rather curious. All except the
murder. . ThaVs.what gets me, for the murder
liad no new points, no fancy touches, no senti­
ment, no mystery. Was just one of the old
style, * sub-head * paragraphs. Old-fashioned
miner scrubs along on hard tack and beans, and
saves up a little money to go home and see rela­
tions. Old-fashioned assassin sharpens up knife,
old style, loads old flintlock, brass-mounted
pistol; walks in on old-fashioned miner one
dark night, sends him home to his relations
awav back to several generations, and walks off
with the swag. No mystery there; nothing to
dear up; subsequent revelations only imperti­
nence. Nothing for any ghost to do—who
meant business. Afore than that, over forty
murders, same old kind, committed every
year in Calaveras, and no spiritual post
obits coming tUic every anniversary; no
assessments made on the peace and
quiet of the surviving community. I tell you
what, boys, I’ve always been indined to throw
off on the Cave Citv ghost for that' alone. IPs

Official returns stare that the Russian
losses in killed and wounded during the
late war amounted to 89,304 officers
and men. Among these were ten Gen­
erals killed and eleven wounded. One
Prince of tho Imperial family and thirty­
four members of the higher nobility of
Russia fell on the field of battle Of
the wounded, 80,824 are already per
fcctly recovered, and 10,000 more will
be able to leave the hospitals during the
next few weeks. The proportion of kill­
ed and wounded to the total number
engaged was very large, one out of every
six men who went into action being
either injured or loft dead on the field |
of battle. In the great actions of the j
late Franco-German war the proportion
of killed and wounded to men engaged
was nearly the same, being one-sixth in
the battles of Worth and Spicheren, and
one-eiglit in the battle of Mars-la-Tuur.
The returns also show that one out of
every eleven wounded men received into
the Russian hospitals died from the in­
juries received. Paring the whole cam
paign only two men were punished with
death; one for the crime of desertion. 1
the other for robbery, accompanied wiji
violence. On the othes hand, 20,000
rewards were given in the form of dec
orations, promotions, or awards of mon­
ey. the Right Corps, which so long held
and defended the ShipkaPass, receiving

On the morning of the storm, two
freighters, Mr. James McDermott and
companion, started from Camp Robin­
son for Sidney with their teams. They
soon were lost and became separated,
and on Saturday Mr. McDermott was
found under the following circumstan­
ces:
He had wandered for twelve days,
accompanied by two dogs, without food
of any kind, exposed to the storm day
and night, sleeping without shelter or
covering on the cold ground, and had
wasted away to a mere skeleton. To
add to his sufferings, one day he saw­
near him some cow boys, but was too
weak to call loud enough to attract
their attention, and like a shipwrecked
seaman who sees a sail approach, but
before it comes within hailing distance
bear away again and disappear, he saw
them pass from him. On Saturday
these same boys heard a faint barking
or yelping like that of dogs, and follow­
ing the sound they came to them. The
dogs were also reduced to skeletons,
and scarcely had strength to stand, be­
ing in tlio last stages of starvation.
The cow boys threw them some meat,
but instead of eating it themselves,
they picked it up in their mouths,","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84022149/1878-03-30/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,wyu_baggs_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Cheyenne daily leader.,N.A.

The child of colored puroulsot dUlcrcnt’tlnls,
such as quadroon ona mulatto, or mulatto and
black, will bo nearer tho tint of tho darker
parent. If both parents aro of tho game color,
tho child will he a shade darker, and, singularly
enough, tbe second child will bo darker than tho
tlrst, thu third darker thau the second, and so
ou to tho last, lu other words, a colored coin­
inunitv, kit to Itself, is fatuity destined to ru­
turu to the original African black after, a limited
number uf generations. 'Tims, while each new
alliance with an Individual of pure Caucasian
blood brings tno negro n step nearer to the
white standard, the reverse Is the ease the mo­
ment the Caucasian element Is withheld, and
the color retrogrades trout light to dark.
A curious proof of this Is found in observa­
tions made during some time in ono of the Isl­
ands. A mulatto woman had a female cuild by
a white man: this young girl pave birth to a
quadroon bv n white father, and this recrosslng
with thu white race was kept up for six genera­
tions. An Identical process ot rvcrussmg bad
been simultaneously noticed In another planta­
tion. The children resulting from the seventh
crossing m both uf these families wore of re­
markable physical beauty; they had blonde hair,
their complexion was of such transparent fair­
ness that they rnlcht have been taken fur Albi­
nos, hut lor the vigor ami gracefulness of their
llmus and tbclr brilliant Intellect, The must
experienced ere could nut have detected lu them
tho slightest Indication of their African origin.
They intermarried. Their children were dark­
complexioned, and tbe children of their children
are very dark mulattocs.
This Inexorable law of Nature is given as one
of the principal reasons why the Creoles refuse
to Intermarry with families who have the faint­
est tinge of negro blood In their veins, though
their skin mar no os fair as that ot Europeans.

Bow to Learn to Swim.
Every boy and girl 6hould learn to
swim. A writer in the American Agri­
culturist offers the following sugges­
tions, by obedience to which the art of
swimming may be readily acquired.
When I was a boy, I learned to 6wim
by means of a swimming-board. This
is the safest method possible. If corks
are used, they may slip from around the
breast down beneath the body, throw­
ing the head below the surface, and
putting the wearer in danger of drown­
ing. Some country boys get two
bladders and then tie them together
with a sort of cord, and use these as sup­
ports. They are the most dangerous
things possible for a boy to have. The
board is perfectly safe, and one may
learn to swim in a very short time by
using one. It should be over four feet
long, over a foot wide, and two inches,
thick, made of soft white pine or cedar.
To use it, a boy wades into the water
up to his shoulders then, taking hold
of the end of the board, he pushes it
before him towards the bank, and not
into deeper water springs forward
with his feet, and throws himself flat
upon the water. This movement
carries him along a few feet. He then
draws op both bis legs at tne same time
keeping the knees as far apart as pos­
sible, and theu strikes out with both
feet, not straight backward, but side­
ways, just as a frog does. The stroke
is made slowly, and is repeated again,
drawing up the legs slowly and stead­
ily. The board keeps the head above
water. When the leg-stroke has been
learned, one hand is taken from the
board and the stroke learned, or the
chin may be rested on the board, while
the stroke is taken with both hands.
This is a very good plan, as it compels
the swimmer to keep bis hands under
the water, which he should always do.
By-and-by, the board may be pushed
ahead, and the young swimmer may
swim after it, always keeping it within
reach. When a number of boys go to
swim, they should always have two or
three of these boards with them for use
in case of any accident.

But soon we are to have, for the
first time in two thousand years, all
four of thet planets against us. They
will be at their nearest approach to
the sun in or soon after 1880, so that
for a few years, say from 1880 to 1885.
the vitality of every living thing will
lie put to a severe and trying ordeal.
Some persons think they see in the
signs of the times evidences of the
great disasters in the immediate
future. The excessive heat, the un­
exampled cold, the prevalence of flood
and disasters at sea, the general failure
of the potato crop, the widespread
chill fever among human beings, and
the equal presence of the epizootic
among animals, are mentioned as
among the premonitions of the rapidly
approaching perihelion.
Well, ""forewarned is to be fore­
armed."" Accidents excepted, we know­
very well that the persons of more
vigorous constitutions aud more by
gienic habits will have the better
chance to survive whatever adverse in­
fluences the extraordinary perihelia
will occasion. It is well known to

Vinjlntt (lit.) Knontrtr, Jlarch I.

John McXamer wan burled last Sunday, near
Petersburg, Menard County. A long while ago
he was Assessor and Treasurer n[ the county
for several successive terms. Mr. MeXomer
was an early settler In that section, and before
the Town of Petersburg was laid out was in
business at Old Salem, a village that existed
many years ago two miles south of the present
site of Petersburg. Abe Lincoln was then
Postmaster of the place, and sold whisky to lls
Inhabitants. There arc old-timers yet living In
Menard wbo bought many a Jug of corn*
juice from Old Abo when he lived at Salem.
It was hero that Annie Hutlecc dwelt, tmd
in whose grave Lincoln wrote that his heart was
burlca. As the story runs, the fair and'gentlo
Annie was originally John MeXomur’s sweet­
heart, hut Abe look a “shine ”to the young
lady, and succeeded In heading olt MeNumer,
and won her aflectlons. But Annie Hullege
died, and Lincoln went to SpringticUl, where he
same time afterwards inarned. It is related
that during the War a lady belonging ton prom­
inent Kentucky family visited Washington to
beg for her son’s pardon, who was then in prison
under sentence ol death fur belonging to a band
of guerrillas who hud committed many murders
nm| outrages. With the mother was her dnugu­
tcr, a beautiful - young lady, who was
an accomplished -musician. Mr. Lincoln
received the visitors in his usual kind
manner, and the mother made known
the object of her visit, neeotnpunving her plea
with tears and sobs nud nil the customary
dramatic incidents. There were probably ex­
tenuating circumstances in favor of the young
Hebei prisoner, and while the President seemed
to be deeply pondering, the young lady moved
to a piano near by, and taking a seat commenced
to sing “Gentle Annie,” a very sweet and
naltietVc ballad, which, before the War was a
familiar song In almost every household in the
Union, nml is not yet entirely forgotten, for
that matter. It is to he presumed the young
lady sang the song with more plainttvencss mnl
effect than Old Abe had ever heard it In
Springfield. During its rendition, lie arose
from his scat, crossed the room to a
window (n the westward, through which lie
guzed for several minutes with that “sad,
far-awav look,” which Ims so often been noted
as one of bis peculiarities. His memory, no
doubt, went bade to the days of Ids humble life
on the hanks ol the Sangamon, and with visions
of Old Salem mid It* rustic people who once
gathered In ids primitive store, came a picture
of the “Gentle Annie” of his youth, whose
ashes hud rested for maav long years under the
wild flowers ami brambles of the old rural bury­
lug-ground, but whose spirit then, perhaps,
guided him to the side of mercy. Re that as it
may. Mr. Lincoln drew a large red silk hand­
kerchief from bis coat-pockct. with which no
blew his nose vigorously. Then he turned,
advanced quickly to his desk, wrote
■ a brief note which ho handed to
the ludy, and informed her that
It wos the pardon she sought.
The scene was no doubt touching in a groat de­
gree, ami proves that a nice eong well sung has
often a powerful influence in recalling lender
recollections, lb proves also that Abraham
Lincoln was a man of flue feelings, and Hint, if
the occurrence was a put-up Job on the lady’s
part, it accomplished its purpose all Ilia some.
There arc but few of the Old Salem friends
and companions of Mr. Lincoln still living, ami,
we ore told, they are widely scattered, William
0. Greene, of Tallula, now a wealthy banker
and funner, was an Intimate friend of Lincoln
while the latter lived at Salem, and, (t is said,
loaned him the small capital upon which he en­
tered Into business at that place. Mr. McXamer,
wliuse death we ehronHo above, was nlwnvs mi
admirer of Mr. Lincoln, and kept in his posses­
sion many letters written to him bv that gentle­
man, which he valued very highly.

art, that to remove the disease, not to alleviate
its symptoms,, should be the chief aim of med­
ication. Yet in how many instances do we
see this truth admittedi theory, ignored In
practice. The reason that Hostetter's Stom­
ach Bitters is successful in so many cases, with
which remedies previously tried were inade­
quate to cope, is attributed to the fact that
it is a medicine which reaches and removes
the causes of the various maladies to which it
is adapted. Indigestion, fever and ague, liver
complaint, gout, rheumatism, disorders of the
bowels, urinary affections and other maladies
are not paliated merely, but rooted out by it.
It sroes to the fountain head. It is really, not
nominally, a radical remedy, and it endows
the system with an amount of vigor which is
its best protection against disease.

Somebody's child is dyingdying with the
flush of hope on his young face and an inde­
scribable yearning to live and take an honored
place in the world beside the companions of
his youth. And somebody's mother is thinking
of the time when that dear face will be hidden
where no rsy of hope can brighten it -when
her heart and home will be left desolatebe­
cause there was no cure for consumption.
Reader, if the child be your neighbor's, take
this comforting word to the mother's heart be­
fore it is too late: Tell her that consumption
is curable, that men are living to-day, aged,
robust men, whom the physicians pronounced
incurable at the age of twenty-five, because
ne lung had been almost destroyed by the
disease. Dr. Price's Golden Medical Discov. ry
is a most efficient alterative for separating the
scrofulous matter from the blood and lungs,
and imparting strength to the system. It has
cured hundreds of consumptives.
CAREFULLY AVOID THE USE of rasping
cathartics. They weaken the bowels and
leave them worse off than before. Use in­

may now be found almost side by side, rather
low down In the east, a little before sunrise.
Jupiter is the more northern, and the Interval

New York, May 10.—In consequence
of the recent decision of the United-
States supreme court, awarding to the
Denver & Rio Grande railway com­
pany the prior right of location over
the several routes named in its charter,
a powerful syndicate has been formed
here to complete, as soon as possible,
the principal lines in Colorado, Utah,
Arizona and New Mexico included in
the system covered by that decision.
It is announced that three millions of
the five millions proposed for this year's
operations have already been subscribed
and it will be expended in finishing up
the line to Leadville and Ten-Mile, and
in building forthwith to Santa Fe and
the San Juan.

Large Farming a Precarious Businesr.
The following figures are given hy a San
Francisco correspondent of a Philadelphia
paper, as evidence that farming on a gigan­
tic scale is profitable neither to the country
nor to the farmer. He says: “The largest
wheat producer iu California, or in the
world, is Dr. 11. .1. (llenn. He was former­
ly from Monroe comity, Missouri. He is a
man of great eiifcrpri.se and energy. His
ranchc lies in Colusa county, and comprises
i>0,0:10 acres, nearly all arable land. Hi* has
this year 15,000 acres in wheat, which, at a
low calculation, will produce 000,tHH) bush­
els. Ills wheat will sell for 85 cents per
bushel, or *705.000. Dr. (llenn has been
farming ten years, and one would suppose
he ought to have a handsome sum to his
| credit iu hank: hut what with a failure of
crops—which occurs two years in every five
—and the enormous Interest he pays on his
loans, he Is said to owe a round million of
dollars. Last year his credit was had, as he
had no crop. Now, with his splendid crop
|n prospect l\e will probably get oqt. Tho

WHOLE No. 1,901.

i- ! Dal rim pies of St. Paul, who, ten years ago,
i were the largest farmers of wheat in Miu­
n ncsofa, raising as much us 40,(hhi bushels in
ea single year, went to the wall. Another
y large wheat raiser is D. M. Ih-avis, whose
r- land lies on the In.rders of Colusa and
i. Unite comities. He is also from Monroe
0 county, Missouri, and has an unpretending
e little estate of 15,000 acres, ]:t,(NN) of which
u are in wheat, which he thinks will average
i- this year 30 bushels, or 500,000. He also is
- hard pressed, and lam told is paying 0 per
cent on a couple of hundred thousand dol­
e lars of borrowed money. If farmers rais­
ii ing half a million to a million bushels of
wheat cannot get out of debt, it might he
e well to inquire what is the use of having so
ii much land? The truth is that from the
li frequent failure of crops in ('alifornia and
t the waste that attends on large operations
-of that kind, farming on a gigantic seal# in
e this jiortioii of the Pacific coast must Ik*
[* considered a failure. North of this, in Orc­
i> gon and ‘Washington Territories, there is no
ii failure of the harvest; farming operations
l* are carried on on a smaller scale, and couse­
t qiiently the farmers, while not rolling in

his opposite neighor. a
The sun that shone so bravely elsewhere
was seldom visible here; only in the early ,
morning a few golden gleams found their p
way in, and gave faint encouragement to the w
two or three flowers that blossomed in pots U
on the window sill. I
On suqh occasions Hans would pause in his Ic
work, knowing full well what was coming-­
how the casement opposite would be flung ,
open, and a girl's voice, singing a blithe lit- C
tie French song, would ring across the silent
street to hie listening ears; how a slim, pret- a
ty figure would for a moment stand framed n
'in the blossoming scarlet runners, a pretty a;
figure, with dark French eyes, and black hair, d.
drawn up under a white cap, a beautiful con- a
trust, so Hans thought, to his comely, yellow­
haired countrywomen. As soon as this vision A
appeared Hans would pause in his work and
turn his eyes towards it; would wait until
the watering of the flowers and the singing al
of the song were alike ended, and then would
tpproaoh his window. t
""Good morning,"" his neighbor would call v
aeross in that pretty foreign German that
'was so enchanting in his eare-""Good morn- h
Sgn. Monsieur Gottlieb,"" and then with a nod ei
and a smile the trim little figure would B
vanish into the dark shadows, and Hans
return to his work. tt

When one worked hard for it, so that neither h

et Hans., as he worked, dreaming of the days
when stone-carving would not mean daily s
bread but honor and glory to those he loved.
SZ.as pleasanatly conscious all the time of a
:dak head bent over a table drawn close up ii
to the window opposite-a table covered with fI
S any bright-colored scraps of muslin and it
Spaper-which in due course, under these deft, -
small hands, became summer flowers; at this o
short distance seeming to the looker-on the
spoils of a June garden, b
Thus they worked day after day, these two, n
so near tog6ther, yet so far apart abstaining v
from all conversation which might have made
the days pass more quickly; but then an
hour's idleness might mean going supperless q
to bed, so that even Rose Cordier, dearly as n
she loved the sound of herown voice, refrained a
from making use of It, exceptfor an ocoasioh­
S.al song. But when the day was over, when I
the cooiness in the little close street, and the a
shadowy gray of the strip of sky overhead a
1gave notice that the long summer day was fi
drawing to ar end, when the small room grew
dark, ten R.se would rise and open.the door, t
to interchange greetings and gossip'with the I
eighbors--with the women sitting on their a
door.stes, knitting in the peacefu twilight, e
their children playing about them; with the I
fathers returning from their work; with the I
young men loitering about smoking, for Rose
bad always a bright word and look for every a
man, woman and child she knew. d
S And they were all fond of her-of this little
foreigner who had come among them four 3
years ago with an old mother since dead, and
who earned her daily bread honestly among 1
them.
Then as it grew even darker, Hans Gott- v
lieb would become aware that the day and
i*ts work were over and would lay aside his c
Sh.hisel, and also seek what little fesh air there a
""w'as at the door of his dwelling. He did not t
laugh or gossip with his neighbors, as did
iose Cordier; it was not his way, and this
tact was quite recognized by the dwellers in
'William street. Beyond a ""Good evening,
neighbor,"" they did not seek to disturb him in
the enjoyment of his evening pipe, only occa­
lsonally Rose would step across and ask him
what he was at work upon, or if he had a 1
good order and then poor Hans, flushing all
over his fair face, would proceed to describe t
his woi'k,ls prospects, until Rose, with a
pretty shrtgo f her shoulders, would tell him t
in her foreign German she cound not under­
stand him; he must speak slower, much t
alower; it was too late now, but to-morrow
yes to-morrow, he must try and explain it all -
again, for it was interesting, so interesting. I
N ut for now it must be good-night, ""good­
night to everyone,"" and the slight, trim figure
had disappeared, and the door was closed.
The neighbors, watching Hans as he
strolled up and down the little street after­
ward, pipe in mouth nodded and smiled to
one another. ""Ah, when there is enough for
.two over yonder, there will be a wedding l""
such was the form the whispering took.
Even the hardest workers take a holiday
!ow and again, and the feast of St. John the
Baptist is esteemed in Freidrichburg the le­
gitimatesummer holiday of all its industrious
inhabitants. The happy day is spent accord­
ing to an old custom at a small village some
three miles distant from the town, where a
time-honored fair is held.
Lion-tamers, fat women, dwarfs, giants, all
the hundred and one showsthat are the right­
ful property of a fair are to be found there,
and later on there is dancing under a soft
evening sky. and after that. home early, so as
to be u and about on the morrow, to work, if
poassale, harder than ever, to make up for the
wasted day.

To Rose Cordier, with her quick French
blood, her youth, her light-heartedness, this
fete was one to which she looked forward for
many weeks beforehand, and the little for­
eigner knew she was never likely to want a
cavalier, and this was looked upon as almost
a sine qua non of the entertainment.
The neighbors smiled more than ever when
they saw Rose come out of her door the morn­
ing of the twenty-fourth of June, looking as
kresh and bright as the red roses in her belt,
and Hans appear immediately afterward, a
a companion rose in his button-hole.
They were all standing about in little
St prepang to start themselves to the
o.aestivity; many of them with babies
A h..r.r arms- and little things clinging about
their skirts, but they had time to give an ad­
uiop Vgloo atthis other couple first.
""Befeore we st""said Hans suddenly, a
little constraint aprent in his voice, ""would

huave been working at something I should like
Sshow you.""
""Yes, truly, I should like it I have never

turned back as she aoke, and he

e aid these words to wi

on one side, out of the way of dust and dirt, e
it lay-the half-completed alrelet of carved tc
flowers. di
""It is pretty,"" she said. And then, ""Isit an w
order? What will you get for it?""
""No, it is not an order,"" he said, a little
sadly. ""I have been doing it in thespare mu o
ments after my day's work."" tl
""It is pretty,"" she repeated, touching with
her small fingers the delicate curled leaves, rt
which surely had the stamp of genius upon a
them; ""but it wants domething,"" she added, of
after a pause.
""What?"" he inquired eagerly. ""I have be
looked at it so often that I cannot find out b
whether it is right or wrong."" it
""I know "" she exclaimed, triumphantly. u
""Color I Alh, Monsieur, if you could but see a
the wreath of roses I made last week for the n
Graffinn von Adeldorf for a ball you would tl
know what I meas. Oh""-with a little clasp c+
of her hands-""It was perfect? Perfect as as
LoveI""
Her thoughts had quite wandered awa h
from the delicate flowers before her: indeed n
she did not remember them until they stood
once more in the street, with the door closed a
behind them, when it came across her that
she might have been rude. a
""They are very pretty "" she said, softly, N
""but you see they are not finished yet. When
they are, perhaps, who knows, you might sell 1
them.""
""Perhaps"" he said, ""I could try if you wish
it; but when I made them I thought""-the
color went into his face--""that you would like o
them."" a
""Yes, so I would if you were rich enough to
give presents or if-. Well, you will not E
mind my spealing the truth to you? You are e
rather a dreamer, are you not? This is a bad h
thing,"" shaking her pretty head. ""It does fl
not make a fortune, and money, you know, I
one must have. So take my advice--leave d
off carving things no one cares to buy, and k
only do what you can sell. You are not an- to
Angry,"" repeated Hans ""when you are so
kind as to take an interest in me and wish me I
well? Why""'-- But here the had reached the A
merry, laughing crowd and the spot where a
the omnibus was awaiting them, and the a
rest of the sentence had perforce to await F
completion at some other time. 11
And it was a sentence Hans had not In- i
tended to complete. Not yet. By and by,
when there was a little more money in his F
pocket and a home worthy of offering to a
witfe, then it would be time enough to finish h
that sentence. But on this, as on other oca- V
sione, it was a case of ""man proposes,"" at n
least so far as Hans was concerned, for the to
long joyful day over, and tired holiday-seek­
era, begining to consider the quickest way t
home, he found himself under a soft, starry a
sky walking townward by the side of Rose I
Cordier, o
""It would be pleasanter to walk,"" he had
said, standing by the crowded omnibus, filled I
with drowsy, crying children and wearied c
mothers. ""Are you tired, Mademoiselle""-- t
after a second's pause-' would you rather A
drive?"" t
""No I will come with you,"" she had replied,
""it will save the sous."" b
Bo they had started homeward together. o
And ere very long Hans found himself re- t
verting to those unfinished words of the t
morning.
Love-making seemed so natural, so desir- d
able under these circumstances, that it was a
difficult to think of waking up on the morrow I
to the hard day's work, and the knowledge 1
that where it is so difficut to keep one, what c
would be done if there was yet another.
""It is selfish of me to ask you, ""Rose, when I
have nothing to offer, but I am young, and
strong, and willng to work--and I love you,
Rose.
Hans stood still as he spoke, and his voice t
trembled as he clasped the girl's small hands a
in his. t
Rose was moved too. The tears stood in t
her bright eyes, her cheeks looked pale in the t
starlight.
""Yes. dear Hans,"" she said timidly, in that 1
sweet foreign tongue he had learned to love, t
""but, you see- c
""Yes I see. We could not live upon noth­
Ing. No, alas, no! But, Rose,""-the color
flushing up into his face again as he said hes- r
itatingly, ""we might be engaged? Could you
-oh, I know it is asking a great deal, but t
could you wait for me?""
""Ah Hans, you must not think me unkind, c
but-it would be so long, and -."" There was a
no mistaking the girl's tones, even if the
words were a little vague. c
""And there is Andre Leroux?"" 1
""He is from my country,"" cried the girl I
quickly, blushing a bright rosy red. ""It is I
natural, among strangers, I should like to see t
and talk to a countryman of my own."" S
""Yes, dear Rose, I am not blaming you.
Do not think that. As you say, among 1
strangers, it is pleasant to meet one who c
speaks your language. It must beoften lonely
for you.'
""Yes, Hans,"" Rose replied, brushing the e
tears out of her eyes. ""If it were not for you (
I should find the little street but dull and sad i
since the poor mother died. And, ah,"" as they I
entered the said street, ""here we are at home
How quickly we have come Good night,
Hans.'
She stretched out her hand as she spoke,
and again Hans took it in his, and looked I
down at her.
""It is such a pity,"" she said softly, ""that
you have no money.""
""Such a pity,"" he echoed sadly, loosing her
hand as he spoke.
""And you are not angry with me?"" she
went on.
i""Angry? no, certainly not. Why, I see of
course you were right. It was silly of me to
ask you to wait; you might be an old woman
before I had enough for us to marry on l""
""Yes, dear Hans, it would never do. I knew
you would agree with me when you thought
tt over. But you will still remain my friend?""
""Always your friend, Rose. It does not
matter you know how poor a friend is.""
Thus they parted; Rose to weep a few tears,
and then to fail asleep and dream of Andrew
Leroux; Hans to ponder over whether there
was nothing to be done, nothing he could do,
to better his position.
It was so difficult, more difficult in the pro­
saic light of day even, than when dreaming
over it pipe in mouth, in the soft summer
evenings.

Carving the letters of a dead friend's name
-more often painting them on common
black wood, for the customers who sought
out the little atelier of Hans Gottlieb were
not often well-to-do-is not a swift road to a
fortune.
And although he was not proud, and after
Rose's remarks about the time wasted over
the wreath of roses, which might perhaps
have been turned to better account he had
done what little odd jobs he could after
working hours, still even then the little heap
of saving did not seem to increase much.
And oftener atd oftener now, Hans noted a
certain M. Andre Leroux come up the narrow
street of an evening, to walk up and down in
the twilight with his opposite neighbor.
Each time the sight of the spruce French
flower-maker-for Andre's trade was the
same as Rose's-sent a throb of pain to the
great honest heart of Hans Gottlieb. But he
did not repine, did not blame Rose. It was
one of the many misfortunes of not being
rich, that was all. But not a cause for com­
plaining, only a burden, like so many others
that fal to the lot of the poor man-a part
of his day's work.
It was not so often now that Rose Cordier
ran across in the gloaming to ask how his
work progressed, and the neighbors ceased to
gossip and nod their heads when they saw
them speak to one another. ""It was changed,
all that they had thought likely to come to
pass-the wind was in another quarter now­
they could see, ah yes it was not difficult to
see what was coming.'
Only the children did not forsake Hans, but
were just as eager to talk to him and run
after him as in the days when there was no
sipruce Frenchman to share with him the
honor of the narrow street.
Then came a morning when Hans, as he
worked, saw a couple issue from the opposite
house, followed by as many neighbors as
could spare an hour's holiday; Rose, with a
late Gloire de Dijon in her belt, a bright color
on her cheeks, and her bright eyes shining
with pride and happiness, and her hand on
I Andre's arm.
""Good morning, Hans,"" she cried, in her
sweet voice, as she passed his opea door. ""I
am going to be married this morning but we
shall not take the wedding holiday till Sun­
day. If you can come, do. And then passed
on before there was a chance of saying more
than ""A happy F.ture."" That evening, as
t s Erik k t ""#he rose-wreath--it was
o --hfiae hanced to look
w ow her he elad so oftaen

seen the bent head and the trim figure. But
to-night the lamp was lit, for it soon grew
dark now, too soon for work to be relinquished
with thn twilight, and on the blinds was the
reflection of two heads, of four busy hands.
Hans did not look again; he drew down his
own blind then, and with a sigh went back to
the carving of his delicate rose leaves.
But after that evening he gave up his little
room, packed his few goods and made up his
mind to go away-to go to Rome, that haven
of ambitious minds.
Now that the little savings were not all to
be hoarded against the day when they might
be wanted for another It was no use guard­
ing them any more. Better, so Hans decided
use them in going away to where daily bread
might perhaps be easier come by than in this
narrow German town; where, perhaps, even
the carving he was so fond of might gain him
congenial work, and allow him to put on one
side this other work that occupiled him now.
Beside, if the worst came to the worst, and
he did drift into utter poverty, it did not so
much matter now.
And with that ""now"" Hans buried the past
and started forth on his travels.
First, however, he went across the street, J
and for the first time entereu Rose's domain,
Minme. Leroux, as he had to call her.
""I have come to wish you good-by,
Madame,"" he said. "" And see I have brought
you as a parting present the little wreath. It
He laid it down as he spoke-among the is
colored roses on the table, between Monsieur fr
and Madame as they sat at work. . o
""Oh, that is good of you, very good,"" cried al
Rose, the ever-ready tears coming into her hi
eyes. ""And so you are going away Ah, my g
husband,"" turning toward spruee, neat­
fingered M. Leroux, ""thou must also wish
Monsieur Hans 'God-speed.' for in the old it
days before I was married, he was always a d
kind friend to me. And see also what a beau- a
tiful present he has brought us!"" ri
At his wife's words M. Andre stood up. d,
""Monsieur is amiable, most amiable! Any e.
friend of madame is dear to the heart of it
Andre Leroux I Let me wish you 'bon voy- n
age' and much prosperity."" Then there was ci
a brief farewell from Hans, a few tears from k
Rose, another bow from M. Andre, and Gott- o
loeb had departed, and the husband and wife j
were left alone. ii
""It is graceful, very graceful,"" said the i'
Frenchman, lifting the parting gift of Hans. ti
""One would scarcely have thought his great b
hands could have fashioned such a thing. n
When it grows dark, dear a rle, if you fetch ae
nail and piece of cord, I will myself attach it n.
to the walli"" o
""It is pretty,"" said his wife. ""I always ti
thought so but now, Andre, that I see it h
among all these red roses, I am sure that what t
I said of it at first is quite true-it wants Col- n
orl""
""You have it exactly, my wife,"" replied M. v
Leroux, with fond appreciation of Rose's s
cleverness. ""That is just what it needs-but; a
then, we cannot have everything."" And M. 1
Andre's gaze returned with much satisfaction r
to the crimson roses before him. * * * a
It would have surprised this couple, per- v
haps, if they could have seen on into the c
coming years if they could have listened to i.
the words of a world-renowned collector of I
the beauties of art. o
""He only did two of them""-he was ad- v
dressing some three or four eager listeners in s
a London ball-room--""the one that he did for v
Levieon, and which first made him famous s
You never saw it ? Why, it Is a marvel! The t
curl of the leaves, the very dew on the fresh t
petals, it is wonderful. I would have given s
him anything he asked for one like it. But, f
poor fellow as you know, he only lived just b
long enough to know he was famous.
""However, when I was last in Friedrich- r
burg, his native town, and striving to find out s
all I could about him-if he had done any- v
thing before he went to Rome-there in that C
wretched narrow street, as I was telling you s
before, I found this fac-simile of his greatest Ii
work-a present to a sweetheart I suppose.
They had told me she knew him that he used
to live opposite to her, so I called to see if I f
could glean anything about him, and there, t
hanging up on the wall, I saw that very
wreath that had been haunting me for
months !""
""How did you persuade her to part with
it?""
""Ah Lady Grace, that was not very diffi.­
cult-honest English gold. Her eyes glistened c
at the sight of it! Very pretty eyes they t
were, tool She cried when I took it down I
cried when I told her Hans was dead. But I
her husband comforted her. 'See. my wife,'
he said, 'I will make for thee a wreath of these c
lovely roses of just the same size'-.did I say E
they were artificial-flower makers?-'and we I
will hang it up in its place, so that you will a
not miss the other. And as to him, poor fel. I
low, life is difficult, and perhaps he is as well I
out of it!'
""So Madame dried her tears.""'
""'Ah, that will be lovely,' I heard her say,
as I carried my treasure away ; 'and I like the I
colored ones best. And the money, you see,
my friend, is far better; it willleed and clothe
the children, Iwhereas the wreath-we could 4
only look at it!'
""You are interested in it now, are you not I

gasped Nora.

""Yes, 1 think the wind has changed, a

""I must go below."" w
""Let mo bring you a wrap inaload, Miss
Nora."" pi
""Thanks; hut it is growing late. The pi

""I havo enjoyed tho voyage. It is only
the ond that is unpleasant. Good-night.''
""Ob, what a fool!"" thought Nora, as she
Jay upon her pillow, ""ever to havo writ |l(
ton that Silly, bad-tompored note to m
Mr. Thurston! It did sound spiteful, I th
confess. Perhaps I ought to have told gM
him I was tho author; perhaps ho already a8

""as if I didn't lcnow the difference be- yc

wo get homo to-morrow, thank goodness!
But, oh dear! It might have been all so
nice!""

When they parted next day Miss Nora
was cordial in her thanks, but omitted to U)l
nsk Mr. Elphinstone to call and see her. pi.
Nobody but himselt noticed tho oinis- ctl
sion.
""So you don't wish mo to call?"" ho asked,
deliberately. ""Does our acquaintance
end here?""
""If you ever happen to come to Axrain- Ji
8ter, I shall bo glau to see you""?with a d,
blush. he
""And why may I notseo you here?"" ij<
""1 am going homo to Axminster,"" she co
evaded. pn
""Then I shall certainly happen to go to
there."" he
Tho Elphinstones went to some fashion- ln<
able springs directly, and Nora lost sight c
of them for the nonce. She had dreaded J:
least Lucius should inquire her residence, t|,
and in calling establish her idontity with f0]
Xantippe, and she was greatly relieved bli
when Air. and Mrs. Warner returned from w<
Europe, and she could pack up and start of
off for Axminster. But fate had not de- cu
signed that the affair should end here. ul!
The Axminster train was thrown froiu the wi
track, and when Nora camo to her senses, J""1
she was lying in a cool room, with Nell !*,

ing pain in her head. ?u
""what is it? Where am I? Where? jir
how did you come here, Noll?"" she cried, hi
""Hush, dear! It was so lucky that the xu<
train came to grief just in the midst of on
your friends, so to speak. Now go to sloej>, tei
that's a dear. The doctor says you nro in Al
no dangor, but vou'll have to stay here a 8.'8
long time; and nothing could be nicer \
than to have you here. And your sister ,,
has sent up a nurse, as she's not well hor- !.j
self; so don't got excited.""
Nora had, indeed, fractured an arm, and fri
sustained bruises that would detain hor at W
the Hitter Springs for somo weeks; bub as it
she began to mend she found that her
lines had fallen in pleasant places, after 'JC
all. Lucius Elphinstone made it his busi- j""1
ness to entertain and beguile her invalid J'S
hours; brought in tho latest books, the
choicest flowers, amused her with the cn
fashionable follies at tho springs, with nc
scraps from tho operas and titbits from fa
burlesques of tho day. of
""You see, we had a picnic in the neighborhood
at tho time of tho accident,"" tif
Nell confided to Nora one day, ""ana I in- f?
sisted upon going with Lucius to viow the
wreck, and do what 1 could for tho injured,
and you woro tho first victim wo
stumbled upon. I wish you could liavo
seen Lucius' face, it looked so whito and
strango, as if the iron had entered his
soul.""
**ITn urna von> ?nm "" o?i?1 Wn??

""Dear mo, how coolly you tako it!""
""1 am very grateful. Hail Lucius re- kt
ally cared for her, or was ho only
shocked?
""I am almost sorry that you mend so
rapidly,"" Lucius said to her on the fol- ^
lowing day. ""I hear that you will take =
wings to-morrow, and I shall have no ono
to listen to my nonsenso.""
""There are plenty of listeners Mr. El- T
I phinstone.""
""But nono exactly liko yoursolf.""
| ""Thanks. Who is that coming up the
lawn? It looks like?why, it m Oliver!""
""Oliver?"" repeated Lucius, aghast, see- N
ing the color that trembled on her 11
cheek, the light shining in her eyes.
But before she could reply, the door opon- Ted
and Oliver was in her arms.
""Why. Oliver, did you rain down?""
""I ain't a pollywog, aunty. No, I played
hookey just to come down to see you.

""Jack Thurston!"" B
""Oh yes. Jack and me's all made up;
we ain't going to whip each other no more.
Oh, I say,"" turning to Mr. Elphinstone,
""vou're Jack's cousin, ain't von.""

""Did you ever see Mr. Klnlilnstono be- [<
(oro, Oliver?"" f>
""Lots o( times, over at Jack Thurston's. *
Jack thinks thero's nobody like him, you r

Nora caught Lucius's eye.
""So you are the author of those billetsdoux?
he said, laughing.
""Yes, I am tho Xantippe,"" humbly.
""But youaro not It. Browne?""
""Mv name is Honora Browno."" i
""Well, Miss Browne, since you leave |

appears that the Get man government has
seriously taken this matter in hand, as smok­
ing is practiced to a great excess by the youths
of that country, so that it lias been considered
to have damaged their constitution, and
incapacitated them for the defense of their
country. Incertain towns in Germany the
police have had orders to forbid all lads under
sixteen years of age to smoke n the streets,
and to punish the offence by line and
imprisoment. Moreover a Belgian physician
has found, during a journey of observation
and inquiry, made at the request of the
Belgian government, that the too general and
excessive use of tobacco is the main cause of
colorblindness, an affection which is occasion­
ing increasing anxiety, bot'.i in Belgium and
Germany, from its influence upon railway and
other accidents, and also upon military
inefficiency.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84036032/1879-11-11/ed-1/seq-8,"","",8,"","",1,mthi_jewelwing_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The weekly miner.,Miner Pub.

tains this description by un eye-witness of
the Tay brMgiJ.ijiwister:
“ Enjoying the cozy comforts of my own
parlor fireside on Sunday night, 1 listened to
the fierce clamor of tho storm without, nnd
felt a deep sense of gratitude for tho security
1 1 possessed, mingled with u feeling of com­
passion for the poor sailors on tho sen’bat­
tling with tbo storm. The children had
gathered around me for their usual Bible
stories, nnd with un Instinctive sense of fear
they nestled close to my side as they heard
the wild.eiTorts of tho blast to batter, in the
casement of the window. 1 chose the story
of St. Paul’s shipwreck on tho Island of
Mellta; thinking that tho storm without
might help mu to impress upon their young
minds the terrible nature of the dangers to
which (ho Apostle was exposed us the ship
lay riding helplesly upon the waves, with
four anchors betweun it and certain
destruction. While thus engaged a
blast of wind more furious than be­
fore had caught tho chimney-tops of n house
almost opnustt my parlor windows, and
brought them down to tho ground with a
thundering crush that startled oven* one of
11s to our feet. Stopping over to tho case­
ment 1 gazed out upon the street, and just
then ablaze of moonlight lighted up tho
broad expanse of tho Tay flow*, nelow, nnd
the long, white,- sinuous Hue ut tho Tay
Bridge came Into vlow, 1 looked at my
watch, ami saw Unit It was exactly 7 o’clock.
’Tho Edinburg train will bu duo immediate­
ly,’l exclaimed to my wife; ‘come ami lot
us watch to sec If It will attempt to cross on
such a night.’ So saying, 1 turned down tho
gas In the parlor and prepared to nwnlt the
appearance of the train. Tho light by this
Hum had become must .fitful. Great masses
of clouds wore sweeping across tho expanse
of the heavens,' nt times totally obscuring the
light of ‘ tho full moon. ‘ There she comes,'
cried one of tho children, and at that mo­
ment tho slowly-moving lights of tho Edin­
burg train could ha distinctly seen round­
ing tho curve ntWonnlt, and passing the
signal-box at tho south side, entering
upon tbo long, straight line of that
portion of tho bridge. Tho train once
on tbo bridge, seemed to move along with
greater swiftness, and when the engine
entered UlO lunnel-llku oldsters of the great
girders mr little girl exuvtly described the
effect of tho lights ns through tho lat­
tice-work when she oxoll/1111011, 4 Look, papa,
Isn’t that like lightning?’/ All Ibis lakes some
time to write down, but to tho eye it seemed
as If almost simultaneous with tho entrance
of the train upon tho bridge. A comet-llke
burst of fiery sparks sprang out ns If forcibly
ejected Into the darkness from the engine,
in a lung visible traU’i the streak of fire was
seen till quenched In thu water below. Then
thoro was absolute darkness on tho bridge.
A sllencu fell upon our eager gnmp nt the
window. Then, with stunning force, the
Idea broke upon my mind. 4 Heavens I’ 1
cried,‘l fear tho train Is over tho bridge I*
With a growing horror 1 watched tho curve
nt tho north side to try If 1 could see tho train
pass that point, but as several minutes passed
.nmlno moving object broke tho continuity of
tho bridge at that point, 1 snatched up my
hat ami hurried down and across tho Magda­
len Green, to meet several Individuals all
bent upon the Annie errand ns myself, ,
44 Tho tenibe nature of tho gnlo at this
time may bo Inferred from tho fact that, de­
sceiul ng thf, slope of tho green, X had to
crouch down upon tho grass to prevent my
being blown bodily uwuy. It seumed ns if
tho wind had become a solid compelling
power. Ono gentleman was blown against
another cm tho green, and both tumbles! to­
gether. Thu massive slgnnl-post beside tho
signal-box on thu north end of tho bridge was
bunt by tho wind like a willow wand, ami,
on enuring upon thu esplanade, tbo sand and
Sobbles were daubing about with such force
laltjio hands and faeu were positively sore
with tho violence of tho impact. My hands
held behind my back for n mluuto were com­
pletely filled with tho drifting sand and peb­
ble*]. Looking towards tbo river nothing
clvurly could bo made out Tho water from
the broken Newport water-pipe imtlio bridge
viis pouring Into the river, and, being caught
in Its descent by the wind, was lashed Into a
•ndhty spray that helped to veil the gup that
had by this time been made In the iron high­
way.
“A number of gentlemen having now col­
lected below tbo bridge oh the Esplanade, 0110
of them t’flmbed up into the signal-box above
fend there learned from tho man stationed
less than a mile from tho scene of Um great
catastrophe that hu knew nothing more of
what had happened than Unit tho -train
signalled to him as having entered upon tho
bridge fully fifteen minutes before hud never
reached his station, and that all telegraphic
communication with tbo other slue had
censed. What had In reality happened the
public kmiw now us well us they will ever be
iikciy taknmv. An entire train with its liv­
ing froighthad been swept Into tbo bosom, of
the Tay. The rest was left to tho Imagina­
tion. In the clear sunlight of this morning 1
have again visited tho spot, but so calmly
was the-river thou rolling onwards towards
the tea that, save fur thu Incontestable evi­
dence of the great gap lu mld-rivcr, Uwas

A tender young potato bug
Sat swinging on a vine,
- ' - ' And sighed unto s maiden bug :
''i pray you will be mine.""
Then softly spake the maiden bug :
""I love you fond and true, .
But O, my cruel-hearted pa
Wont let me marry yu.n
With scorn upon his buggy brow.
With glances oold and keen.
That haughty lover answered her :
""I think your par-is green.""

College from the former slave holding States
was tho immediate result. The history of re­
cent years abounds in evidence that in many
ways and many places especially, where their
number has been great enough to endanger
Democratic control the very men by whose
elevatiou to citizenship this increase of re­
presentation was effected have been debarred
and robbed of their voice and their vote. It is
true that no State statute or constitution in so
many words denies or abridges the exercise of
their political rights, but the modes employed
to bar their way are no less effectual.
It is a suggestive and startling thought that
the increased power derived from the enfran­
francliisement of a race now denied its share
in governing the country by those whe lately
sought the overthrow of the government,
is now the sole reliance to defeat the party
which represented the sovereignty and nation­
ality of the American people in the greatest
crisis of our history. Republicans cherish
none of the resentments which may have ani­
mated them during the actual conflict of arms.
They long for a full and real reconciliation be­
tween the sections which were needlessly and
lamentably at strife. They sincerely offer the
hand of good will, but they ask in return the
hand of good faith. They deeply feel that the
party whose career is so illustriously great in
patriotic achievements will not fulfill its des­
tiny until peace and prosperity are established
in all the laud, uor until liberty of thought,
conscience and action and equality of opportu­
nity shall not be merely cold formalities of
statutes, but living birth-rights, which the
humble may confidently claim and the power­
ful dare not deny.
The resolution referring to public service
seems to be deserving of approval. Surely no
man should lie the incumbent of an office the
duties of which he is for any cause unfit to
perform, who is lacking iu ability, in fidelity,
'or integrity, which a proper administration of
such office demands. This sentiment would
meet with general acquiescence,but opinion has
been widly divided upon the wisdom and practi­
cability of various reformatory schemes which
have been suggested and of certain proposed
regulations governing appointments to public
office The efficiency of such regulations have
been distrusted mainly because they seemed
to enact mere educational and abstract tests
above general business capacity and even spec­
ml fitiiPRfi fnv ilio nartûmla» Κη,ηιί. Tr.

seems to ιηβ that the rules which should be ap­
plied to the management of the public service
may prODerly conform in the main to such as
regulate Ihe conduct of successful private bus­
iness. Original appointments should be based
on ascertained filnesss, the tenure of office
shouldbe stable; positions of responsibility
should so far as practicable be filled by promo­
tion of worthy and efficient officers; investiga­
tion of all complaints and punishment of all
official misconduct should be prompt and thor­
ough. These views which i have long held, re­
peatedly declared and uniformly applied when
tailed upon to act I find embodied in the re­
solutions which, of course. I approve. I will
add that by the acceptance of public office,
whether high or low, one does not in my
judgment escape any of his responsibilities as
a citizen nor lose or impair any of a citizen's
rights; that he should enjoy absolute liberty
to think and speak and act in political matters
according to his own will and conscience pro­
vide only that ho honorably, faithfully and
fully discharges all his official duties.
Resumption of specie payments, one of the
fruiis of the Republican party, lias brought
a return of abundant prosperity and the set­
tlement of many distracting questions. The
restoration of sound money, large reduction of
the public debt and of the burden of interest,
and high advancement of public credit all at­
test the ability and courage of the Republican
party to deal with such tinancecial problems
as may hereafter demand solution. Our paper
currency is now as good as gold
and silver is now performing its legiti­
mate functions for the purposes of change.
The principles which should govern the rela­
tions of these elements of the currency are
simple and clear. There must be no deterio­
rated coi","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016025/1880-07-19/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,me_graftonnotch_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Portland daily press.,N.A.

Good health is impossible when the
blood is impure, or when it is thin and
cold. Ciidcr such conditions one dis­
ease after another is developed. Roils,
pimples, headache, neuralgia, rheuma­
tism, etc., are the result of impure
blood, and the wisest course is to make
the blood pure, rich and warm by the
use of Ayer's 3arsaparilla.

RELIGIOUS AND EDUCATIONAL.
—The Quincy system is to be intm*
duced in the schools at Sacramento.
—The Reformed Episcopal Church
has now nine Bishops, and a clerical
force of 101 ministers, including the
Bishops.
—At the examination of the boys and
girls for the New York Normal School,
the averages of the boys were below
those of the girls.

Fifteen thousand dollars are needed
to complete the sum required to fit up
a house for the McCormick telescope at
the University of Virginia.
—Dr. Cairns, now considered the
head of Scotch Presbjterianism, and
principal of the Theological Seminary

Edinburgh, at present in this coun­
try. is a tall, slender man, of nearly
threescore years, with a ruddy com­
plexion, prominent nose, firm mouth
and square chin. He has a strong Scotch
accent and is said to be a speaker of
considerable eloquence.
—A Council General, representing the
entire Greek Church, is to meet at Mos­
cow August 26 for the purpose of re­
establishing the ancient customs and
rites of the church, or drawing closer
the bonds of unity between the various
churches, of recalling to the bosom of
the orthodox church the Christian dis­
sidents of the East and West, and of
promoting the propagation by missions
of the faith of the church.
—The lack of theological students is
in the Jewish ranks as well as in the
Christian, and it is charged to one of
two causes—a lack of spirituality
among the young men, or a conviction
that the more intelligent the worship­
ers are the less need there is for preach­
ing moral and scientific truths. Per­
haps this is so, but the morals of the
community hardlv keep pace with the
intelligence thereof.—Exchange.
—To select the young as teachers for
the young is one of the experiments of
modern times that has proved eminent­
ly successful. The frjsh interest and
enthusiasm of the instructor infuses it­
self into the pupils, who feel a reliance
upon the sympathy and appreciation of
a teacher who still vividly remembers
the difficulties of her own schooldays.
Frequently the elder teachers, although
probably better furnished with patience
and experience, have become the slaves
of routine, bowed beneath the grievous
burden of a weariness of their work.—
Exchange.
—Presbyterianism is said to be losing
ground in the South. The Louisville
(Ky.) Christian Observer reports a con­
siderable reduction in numbers since
1873 and a steady decrease of theologi­
cal students every year. And the in­
terior tells its readers that there are
nine fewer jhurches in Chicaj to-day
than there were ten years 'ago, while
Cincinnati is in a worse condition than
it was thirty years ago. and New York
is said IO be ouly 3,00J bo.to.-oT in
communicants than it was threo dec­
ades ago. Rationalism, worldliness
and indifference to religion are charged
with producing this laxity and loss.

WIT AND WISDOM.

—Did you ever hear of a small fish
escaping after being hooked?
—It is perfectly natural that a man
should see his mistake after he has
made it.
—A wife should be like roast lamb,
tender and nicely dressed. No sauce
required.
—The individual who points with

diamond ring.—Philadelphia Chronicle

—A sh.v wd little fellow lived with

necessaries of life. One day the two
were out walking together and saw a
very thin greyhound, and the man
asked his nephew what made the dog
so poor. 1 expect he lives with his
uncle,"" said the boy.
—They were talking about expenses,
says the Galveston News, and how
some men get rich. Said one: ""My
butcher and baker have made money
enough out of me to build themselves
splendid houses."" Responded the
other: ""The barkeepers I patronize
have built whole blocks out of what I
owe them.""
—""In the hour of danger worn-in
thinks least of herself,"" said Madame
ae Stael. True! When the thunder
roars and the vivid lightning flashes
and the big drops come down, the
woman who is caught out in the storm
devotes her agony to the thought that
her hat and dress will be ruined.
—A friend complains to that the
nights are so abominably hot he can't
sleep. ""My dear fellow,"" says ""you
ought to accustom yqurself to these
alternations of heat and cold. Summer
and winter I always sleep with three
quilts—ic snmmer, I may add, I put
them under me.""
—Conversation between an inquiring
stranger and a steamboat pilot: ""That
is the Black Mountain?'^ Yes, sir
highest mountain about Lake George.""
""Any story or legend connected with
that mountain?"" ""Lots of'em. Two
lovers went up that mountain once, and
never came back again."" ""Indeed!
Why, what became of them?"" ""Went
down on the other side.""
—Bliffers has a Fr. n servant g'rl
of whom he is very prou I. He s:iys ho
never Metz such a girl as Nancy, an I
says that things would soon go to
Rouen if he didn't IIiv:*c in the home.

Recent Points in Etiquette.
Say ""good-bye,"" not ""good-morn­
ing.

Upon leaving a room, one bow should
include all.
Never wait over fifteen minutes for a
tardy guest.

Upon introduction, enter at once into
conversation.
A note requires as prompt an answer
as a spoken qu -stion.

Regrets in reply to invitations should
contain a reason therefor.
Strangers arriving should notify
friends by card or by their presence.

At a table you are required to thank
the one who waits on you.
You should exchange calls with indi­
viduals before inviting them to your
house.

Only letters to unmarried ladies and
widows are addressed with their bap­
tismal name.

To return a personal call with cards
inclosed in an envelope signifies that
visiting between the persons is ended.

Unless there is a great difference in
age, a lady visiting should not rise,
either on arrival or departure of other
ladies.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85025570/1880-08-05/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,mnhi_allemande_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Redwood gazette.,Herriot & Beal,"Redwood Falls, Minn.","","",12347,1646,4973,28065,2,23633,30946,3,mnhi_allemande_ver01/data/sn85025570/00199919945/1880080501/0361.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Redwood_Falls%2C_Minnesota,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/mnhi_allemande_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85025570%2F00199919945%2F1880080501%2F0361.jp2/pct:52.244743,5.318943,21.042610,90.690235/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/mnhi_allemande_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85025570%2F00199919945%2F1880080501%2F0361.jp2/pct:52.244743,5.318943,21.042610,90.690235/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Tho past rises before me like a dream.
Again we are In tho great struggle for Na­
tional life. We hear the sounds of prepara­
tion—the music of tho boisterous drums—
tho sliver voices of heroic bugles. We seo
thousands of assemblages, and hear the ap­
peals of orators: we see the pale cheeks of
women, and the llushetl faces of men; and hi
those assemblages wc see nil the dead whose
dust wo have covered with dowers. We
lose sight of them no more. We are with
them when tney enlist in the great
army of freedom. We seo them part
with those they love.. Some are walk­
ing for tho last time in quiet woody places
with the maidens they adore. We hear the
whisperings nnd tho sweet vows of eternal
love ns they lingeringly part forever. Others
are bonding over cradles, kissing babies that
are asleep. Some are purling with mothers,
who hold them and press them to their hearts
again and again, ami say nothing; and some
are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drlvo
from their hearts tlio awful fear. Wo see
them part. We sec the wife standing in the
door, with the bubo in her arms,—standing lit
the sunlight sobbing: at tho turn of tho
road a hand waves—sue answers by holding,
high in her loving hands tha child. He Is
gone, and forever.
. We see them all as they march proudly
away under the Haunting lings, keeping time
to the wild, grand music of war—marching
down the streets of the prenlcltios—through
tiie towns and across the prairies—down to
the Helds of glory, to do and to die for tho
eternal right.
We go with them one and all. Wo are by
tbeir sides on all the gory Helds—in all ttio
hospitals of pain—on all the weary marches.
We stand guard with them in tho wild storm
and under the quiet stars. Wo tire with
them In ravines running with blood—in the
furrows of old Helds. We are with them
between contending hosts, unable to move,
wild with thirst, the life ebbing slowly away
among the withered leaves. We see them
pierced by balls, and torn with shells, In the
trenches by the forts, and in the whirlwind
of the charge, where men become iron, witli
nerves of steel.

We are with them In the prisons of hatred
and famine, hut human speech can never tell
what theyendured.
We are home when the news come that
they arc dead. We see the maiden in the
shadow of her Ural sorrow. We see the
silvered head of the old man bowed with die
last (rrlef.

Thu past rises before us, and wo see 4.000,-
000 of human belnits governed by tho lash—
we see them bound hand and font—wo hear
tho strokes of cruel whips—we see the
hounds tracking women through tangled
swamps. We see babes sold from the breasts
of mothers. Cruelty unspeakable I Outrage
Intinitl
Four million bodies In chains,—four mill­
ion souls in fetters. All the sacred relations
of wife, mother, father, and child trampled
beneath tho brutal feet of might. And all
this dune under our own beautiful banner of
tho free.

'I lio past rises before us. Wo hoar tho roar
ami shriek of the bursting shell. The broken
fetters full. These heroes died. We look.
Instead of slaves wo see men, and women,
and children. Thowuml of progress touches
tho onclluu-block, the slave-pen, tho whip­
plug-post, and we see homes, and firesides,
umf .school-houses, mid books, and whore all
was want, and crime, and cruelty, and fet­
ters, wc see tho faces of tho free.
These heroes are dead. They died for lib­
erty—they died for us. They are at rest.
They sleep In tho land they made free, un­
der the tlag they rendered stainless; under
tho solemn pines, tho sad hemlocks, the tear­
ful willows, and the embracing vines. They
sleep beneath the shadows of tho clouds,
careless alike of sunshine or of storm, each
In tho wlndowlcss palaco of rest. Earth may
run red with other wars—they are at ponce.
In the midst of battle, In tho roar of con­
lllct they found tho serenity of death. FA
voice—“ Glory,’’] I have ono sentiment for
tho soldiers living and dead-cheers for the
living and tears fur tho dead. *

GARFIELD'S HATRED OF
THE SOUTH.
There is no man in the country
who hates the Southern people as
Garfield does; his hatred borders
on the savage. What consideration
could the Southern people expect
from such a man? And what in­
fluence would he have in restoring
peace and good will between the
sections and in building up and ad­
vancing the prosperity of a common
country ? The following extracts
from some of his speeches in Con­
gress show the malignity of the
man:
In discusting the Confiscation'Act,!
Mr. Garfield took the ground that the
Confederates were in the same cate­
gory with the Tories of the Revolu­
tion-; that their lands and personal
estates ought to be confiscated and par­
celed out among the Federal soldiers.
These were his words:
""Confiscate their estates, both per­
sonal and real, for life and forever.
The war began by proclamation. WE
CAN HOLD THE INSURGENT
STATES IN MILITARY SUBJEC­
TION FOR HALF A CENTURY
IF NEED BE. I WANT TO SEE
IN ALL THOSE STATES THE
MEN WHO FOUGHT AND SUF­
FERED FOR THE TRUTH, TIL'
LING THE FIELDS ON WHICH
THEY PITCHED THEIR TENTS.
(Globe, 1st Sess. 38th Cong., p. 405.)
In his remarks on one of the recon­
struction measures, Mr. Garfield said:
""If the gentlemen who report this
bill will put in a section, that all who
participated in the rebellion shall be
FOREVER excluded from the right of
elective franchise, then I will say the
proposition will be just, and one we
can stand upon as a matter of principle.
Anything is just which excludes from
privilege and power ALL those in­
famous men who participated in re­
bellion.""
Subsequently, the same bill being be­
fore the House, Mr. Garfield asked that
the previous question be voted down,
that be might move the following
amendment:
""All persons who voluntarily ad­
hered .to the late insurrection, giving
aid and comfort to the so-called South.
er Confederacy, are FOREVER ex­
eluded froi bolding any office of
trust or profit under the Government
of the United States.'""
Read thc following .cold-bloodcd
declarations deliberately uttered on the
floor of the House:
""It is clearly the right of the vic­
torious government to INDICT, TRY,
CONVICT, AND HANG EVERY TRAITOR
IN THE SOUTH for their bloody con­
spiracy against the Republic. * * *
I believe, sir, the time has come when
we must lay the heavy hand of mili­
tary authority upon these rebel com­
munities and hold them in its grasp.
* * * * * *
""I give my support to this miltary
bill. it is severe. IT WAS WRIT­
TEN WITH A STEEL PEN MADE OUT OF
A BAYONET, and bayonets have done
us good service hitherto. ALL I ASK
is THAT CONGRESS SHALL PLACE
CIVIL GOVERNMENTS BEFORE THESE
PEOPLE OF THE REBEL STATES, AND
A CORDON OF BAYONETS BEHIND
T HE M."" See Cong. Globe, ld Ses
sion, 39th Congress, pp., 1103, 1104.
On the ~18th of February, 18637,
nearly two years after the close of the
war, the same bill being under discus­
sion, Mr. Garfield made another ex­
hibition of his malignity towards the
people of the South. Speaking in a
tone of exhultation and with a smile
of triumph, like a cowardly depsot
with his iron heel upon the neck of
his victim, this advocate of imperialism
uttered the following language :
- ""Mr. SPEAKER. This bill starts out
by laying hands on the rebel govern­
ments and taking the very breath of
life out of them. In the next place
it puts the bayonet at the breast of
every rebel in the South. In the next
place it leaves in the hands of Con­
gress utterly and absolutely the work
of reconstruction.- Gentlemen here,
when they have the power of a thun­
derbolt, in their hands, are afraid of
themselves, and stagger like infants
under the weight of a power they
know not how to use. If I were
afraid of this Congress, afraid of my
shadow, afraid of myself, I would die­
claim against this bill, and I would do
it as distinguished gentlemen around
.I ne (mn,,ing his timid Republican as­

sociates) have done, and do declaim
against it. They have spoken veh'em­
ently-they have spoken sepulebrally
-against it, but they have not done
us the favor to quote a line or the
proof of a single word from th bill it­
self that it does any of the horrible
things they tell us of. They tell us it
is universal amnesty, AND THERE IS
NOT A LINE IN THE BILL THAT WILL
MAINTAIN THE CHARGE.'"" (lbid, p.
1320.)

One of the greatest blessings you can
enjoy, is a tender, honest, enlightened
conscience.
A good Christian is not a crave to
bury God's mercies, but a temple to
sing His praises. Thomas Watson,
10d7. . .-, , ,
Hk that hath tasted the bitterness of
sin will fear to commit it; and ho that
nam felt the sweetness of mercy will
fear to offend it. Vharnock.
Give the man such a heart as the
Bon of God describes in the beatitudes,
and the whole universe of sorrow cannot
rob him of his. blessedness.
' Let us take care how we sneak to
those who have fallen on life's field.
Help thera up, not heap scorn nnon
them. We did not see the conflict. We
do not know the scars.
Thk true Christian, amidst all the
diversities of opinion, searches for the
holy in desire, for the good In council,
for the Inst in works: and he loves the
good, under whatever temple, at what
ever aitar, ne may nnd him. Sidney
Smith.
Till relirrion becomes the desire of
our hearts, it will not become the busi
ness of our lives. Most of the beati
tudes which Infinite Compassion pro­
nounced have the sorrows of earth for
their subject, but the Joys of Heaven for
their completion. HimnaK Mart.
He that makes but one step no a
stair, thounh he be not so much nearer
the top of the house, yet he has stepped
from the ground, nnd is delivered from
tho foulness and dampness of that. So,
in this first step of prayer, O Lord, be
merciful unto me though a man be not
established in Heaven, yet he has stop­
ped from the world nnd tho miserable
comforters thereof N. Y. Obterver.
I have not always floate I on the
calm sea of content, but have often met
with cross v. inds and storms, and with
many troubles of mind and temptations
to evil; and yet, though I have been,
and am, a man compassed about with
frailties. Almighty God hath by His
grace prevented me from making ship-
wreca oi iaun ana a good conscience,
the thought of which is now the iov of
ray heart, and I most humbly praise
nun lor ii. veorge neroen.
There are times when the tide of
Christianity seems to be turned back­
ward, and ""the world seems to be wax­
ing worse and worse. When our eye
runs along the line of a great river, we
come to points where the current is ob­
structed, and the surface is broken into
eddies, till the whole stream seems to
be turned backward. That is only the
surface view. The deep water of the
mighty river is all the while rolling on-
nsru, auu nasiing 10 pour itsever-in-oreosiug
volume into the boundless
ocean below. So, also, notwithstand­
ing thoso discourajriue surface views
that sometimes distntct our faith and
appall our hearts, the deep undercur­
rent of Christianity is really moving
onward; and the fact shall be demon­
strated to our sight by and by when, In
thecloar light of a brlsrhter revelation.
we comprehend more of the desisrn and
work of God. TJisAon D. W. Clark.

Eternity Always Present.

The lines of our life stretch farther
than we think. We lay our plans for
the future, and they prove to be traoks
that never end. All our paths go out
into tbo unseen world. As you look
across the street, the line of your vis­
ion is terminated by some building.
You can see nothing' beyond. If that
building were away, you could see
other buildings and streets; and if
these, too, were gone, the line of your
vision would shoot off beyond the
stars till it had rcachod the utmost
verge of the groat universe. So the
hopes of (his earthly life its plans,
and schemes, and busy contriving
are all endless lines that reach into an
endless eternity. Within the little cir­
cle of yourself, the plans you make for
to-morrow, the wishes ana hopes you
entertain for the coming months and
years, you may not see or realize how
far your favorite purposes stretch off
into the distance. Do you ever think
now luey toucn on tne margin oc an
endless future f Do you never Bee how
all earthly things are embosomed in
an always-present eternity? We walk
every day in the embrace of eternity.
The issue of every purpose is there; the
end of every plan is there; the result of
every deed is there; no path will end
this side. Oongregationalut.

A Word in Season.

A FftlXN'D of mine, save a writer in
the Interior, was one day in earnest
Dusiness conversation with a gentle-
mar, a wholesale marble dealer. First
they went to the quarries, where nature
baa storea np her exnaustiess sunDlies.
and then through long lines of huge
blocks in the rough; and thence to the
ready-prepared material; with row
after row of choioely-fiaUhed bases,
dies and columns; all in great variety
of styles and pattern. Now here was a
group oi tjniumbtan, so much admired
lor its a art shaains oi blue ana slate,
with vein of black, and over there, the
American variegated, with its lovelv
cloud-tints of pearl and amber and sea
green. .Ana beyond hues monuments
of Nova Scotia granite, so closely re­
sembling the famous Aberdeen. Selec­
tion were made, and orders given for
the usual amount. The owner was a so­
cial, genial man, and . entertained his
customer ny stiowine mm all the Ira
provements of his extensive business;
the perfeot sawing and polishing
brought out by the uulimited power of
steam, inus giving tne rapiu ana oon
taut supply of his increasing deruauil

foT-the spring and fall sales. My friondl
was truly interested in all this, but
deeply pained (for he was a religious
and God-fearing man) by hearing the
continuous repetition of oaths in the
most profane manner. As he went to
the office and their business wnsAbout
finished, ho saldi ""Now my friend,
skip tho hard words, skip the hard
words,"" and again boforo leaving,
""Skip tho hard words. Don't forget
It."" How little he thon roali.od the re­
sult of this kindly warning. It was the
arrow of conviction to this man's heart.
At the usual titno, six months lntor, niy
friontl again called for a new supply
and found his friend intent in his lino of
business, but a chnngod man, and
changed, Iniloed, for the bolter. The
marble merchant thought my frljnd
noticed a diliurenco and frankly said to
him, ""Do you remember what you said
to me last fall when you were here.
'Skip the hard words P' ""
0 yes, but I had almost forgotten
""Well I did not. I thought It over
that day after you loft, and said to my­
self: Here I have been using these
words many years, It must be about time
to make a change, and with this thought
oaroe a purpose, and with this purpose
came a resolve, and with God's help I
have kept it and will continue to keep
it."" ""

How to Have a Good Conscience.

To secure the intelligent and there­
fore right action of conscience, it must
have a moral law to guide it. It must
sail by a chart. That lawis two-fold.
It is the written law of the Bible, and it
is tho inner low written upon the heart.
The Bible is not universally known. In
order to accountability through con­
science thore must, therefore, be a law
within us. Thus Paul argue in the
second of Romans. Those who have
no external law hare one in their con­
sciences. As a matter of fict this uni­
versal law is everywhere discoverable.
"" I am and 1 ought, are twins born at
the same time.""
The cases of heathen who with good
conscience do wrong are sometimes
quoted to show that there is no univer­
sal standard that can be regarded as
authoritative. But a heathen is only
""the germ of humanity."" In him wa
should expeot, therefore, to find only
the germ of conscience. , That its' de­
cisions aro- sometimes wrong proves
only that conscience like the body, or
the mind, or a flower, should be judged
only at its maturity. And even the bad
conscience of a heathen argues the uni­
versal moral law and the intuitive moral
judgment, for the conscience, however
perverted and mistaken in its aotion,
springs from a oommendable motive.
it follows, then, that to have a cood
conscience we must use it intelligently.
We must avail ourselves of the best
moral standard we can reach, and we
must cultivate the habit of applying ev­
ery action of life to that standard. And
here comes in the supreme value of Bi­
ble study as a practical measurement of
life. If we are measuring people by a
six-foot rulo, many cases will throw us
into doubt, they so nearly or so exaotly
come to the standard. But if we meas­
ure people by Bunker Hill monument
we will never be iu doubt. Christians
often get into trouble by submitting
thoir conduct to low Btanuards. They
measure by policy, or expediency, or
the religious fashion. They do doubt­
ful things because other people do them.
They have Bibloless consciences. If we
use the rule of the lowest possible ad­
missible Christian life, we will often be
in doubt where we might have the dog­
matic certainty of a good conBoionoe if
we only measured by a higher rule, and
saw that all conduct not Christ-like
must be condemned.
Let us have more ethical nreochlnir
that Insists not only on the importance
of a conscience, but that admits for a
Chistrian conscience no standard lower
than the Bible. Every other leads to
demoralisation. Let it be insisted on
that to have a Biblically enlightened
conscience and to live loyal to its orders
is the lowest demand of Christianity.
A conscientious Christian is the very
prinoe of titles. A man may think
right and have a bad conscience. He
may feol right at times with a bad or
stupid conscience. But a good con­
science is the consent of a man's entire
moral nature to the course of his con
science. Chicago Interior.

Nevada Electricity.

A GENTLEMAN Of this citv ova that.
about one o'clock yesterday morning
the whole earth in this region was very
highly charged with electrioity. He
first discovered the fact by accidentally
placing his hand upon an iron lamp­
post, when he felt quite a sharp shook.
He then tried the post with his door-key
and quite a large spark was the result.
With the key he succeeded in extract­
ing sparks from iron door frames and
from the tops of hydrants. On looking
at the iron flagstaff' on the summit of
Mount Davidson he found that about .
tho top of it was visible quite a large
and brilliant carona of light. In two or
three places on the steetwire guys by
which the flagstatt' is stayed were seen
small, but bright, balls of light. These
appeared to glide up and down, and
occasionailv aisaoueured for some sec
onds, but that at the top of the staff re­
mained constantly in view, though it
was observed to contract and expand,
it seemed to expand when the balls of
light on the guys slid np the staff and
disappeared, and to ooutract when they
again made their appearance. On
brushing the sleeve of his coat with his
hand the) gentleman observed that
sparks were produoed similar to those
seen in stroking the back of a oat. The
neavens were perfectly clear ana the air
very sharp. A moderate breeze was
blowing from the northwest, and to the
northward, over the crest of Cedar Hill,
were seen vibrating faint spires of an
auroia borealia. On arriving at his
room, while moving articles about in
search of matches, the gentleman no­
ticed that sparks were produced when
some of the things were shoved togeth
er, in snort, ne says there appeared to
be a regular electric ""shower"" that per
vaded and strongly charged everything.

Small-pox How the Disease Is Trans
mltted Its Historical Ravages.
The cause of small-pox is universally
admitted to be a specific, contagion, the
nature of which medical research . has
thus far failed to discover."" No disease
is, in all probability, so, contagious. "" A
prominent physician- wild -had given
particular attention to it, and had had a
very wide and varied experience in its
treatment, said, eighty years ago, that
he had never known a single instance in
which persons liable to small-pox could
pass any time with a patient in the
chamber without taking the infection.
There have been instances where the
poisonous effluvium has crossed a river
1,500, feet wide and effected ten out of
twelve workmen on the other side. , The
contagion acts through the air, by con­
tact with the skin or by inoculation, and
may be imparted by a corpse which has
not been couched. Just what products
of tho diseased body are contagious are
not precisely Known, Dut tnat tne con­
tents of the postules and dried scabs are
so has been definitely ascertained. Med­
ical opinion differs as to the period when
the disorder begins and ceases to be
contagious, but it is prudent to believe
it capable of self-propagation as soon as
the febrile symptoms have declared
themselves. How soon the patient
ceases to be dangerous has not been de­
termined accurately ; but the stability of
the contagious principle may be inferred
from the fact that clothing will retain it
for months and for years, it is said,
when confined. ' Small-pox appears,
like all the contagious exanthemata, in
epidemio form at irregular, and, a3 far
as can be learned, at capricious, inter­
vals. After an extraordinary exemption,
perhaps for years, a district may bo
suddenly invaded by it, where it will
continue to prevail for a longer
or shorter period, and then spon­
taneously disappear, not to be revived
for a protracted period. Epidemics
differ much in intensity, and isolated
cases are generally milder than where
the distemper ragos. Race has a good
deal to do with the severity of this dis­
ease, the dark races, notably the negro
and our aboriginals, being very suscepti­
ble to it, and showing very little power
to resist it. Although vaccination is
generally acknowledged to be a pre­
ventive, soma physicians have recently
declared it to be but partially effective.
Small-pox, while it continues to be very
dangerous, is far less so than it used to
be. At one time the proportion of
deaths to cases was one to four. It is
more apt to prove fatal in childhood
and old age than in the intervening
period. In former time3 the eruption
was believed to be an effort of nature to
get rid of noxious matter, and stimulat­
ing and heating measures were therefore
adopted to that end. Tho history of the
loathsome disease is rather obscure.
There is no evidence that the Greek or
Arabian writers of the sixth century
knew anything of it. The first accurate
account of it was. given by Rhazes, an
Arabian phylcian, who lived in the
early part of the tenth century. It seems
to have reached England nearly 100
years later, and, after the Crusades, it
prevailed in the temperate regions of
Africa, but not in the far North until
some time later. Early in the sixteenth
century it was carried from Europe to
the New World, where it raged furious­
ly, killing 51,600,000 of people in Mexico
alone. In 1707 it was introduced into
Iceland, and nearly one-fourth of the
entire population fell victims to it, and
twenty-six years after it nearly depopu­
lated Greenland. These examples cor­
roborate the well-founded opinion that
contagious diseases are always most vir­
ulent when they first occur in a country
or region that they have not before vis­
ited. New York Times.
Old Age.
The brain in old porsons after the age
of seventy diminishes both in bulk and
donsity, and thus becomes lighter. Its
capacity for continuous hard work is
thereby lessoned, as really as is that of
the body for muscular labor. As an old
man. however, has the accumulated
knowledge, skill and practical experi­
ence of a lifetimo, and that wonderful
facility which comes of habit, he may,
with good health and care, do much of
his best work in the neighborhood, say,
of eighty. Ho can not bear mental
strain, and he must not attempt mental
""spurts,"" but he can still show himsell
a ""workman that needeth not to be
ashamed."" Since, however, the brain is
not then so firmly supported by the
skull, and is slighter in texture, the blood
vessels are more easily dilated or rup­
tured. The danger of paralysis and ap
oplexy is still further inoreased, because
the blood vessels oecomeinoiu aemore
or less ossified and brittle, and thus less
able to sustain a sudden rush of blood.
The aired should carefully abstain from
every form of violent action, and, in
deed, from every violent emotion. The
full term of toil, whether in rearing and
supporting children or in the service of
tho pumic, earns a rignt to wnat is tne
normal physiological condition of age
freedom from all that annoys, perplexes,
harasses, excites and burdens. YouWt

but a part of a deep laid scheme by somebody
to punish prominent leaders for being openly
friendly to me. I cannot believe that Gen.
Garfield Is the author of this policy. I give
him credit for being too big a man to descend
to such means for tne punishment ot men who
gave him a hearty support In his election and
who are disposod to give blm the same support
now, for the offenceof having had a former
preference for some else for the office which he
now holds. But Gariield is President and 13
responsible for all the acts of the administration.
Conkllng and Piatt are tlio chosen
senators from the great state of New York,
and that, too, against all the opposition of an
administration created by the same party that
elected them. This should give them all the
stronger claim to be consulted in the matter of
appointments in their state. When it come3 to
fining the most lniluentlal office in their state
without consulting these senators It Is a great
sligtu When he selects the most offensive
man to be found It becomes an insult, and
ought to be resented to the bitter
end. I sincerely hope the President wiu see
this and correct his mistake himself, and restore
harmony to the party. He owes this to
himself and to those without whom he could
not have been elected. Nobody believes that
he could have carried the state of New York
without the active support of her present Senators.
Their passive support would not have
answered. Without the state of New Yo'k
Gen. Garfield would not now be President.
His rewarding Robertson is not only offensive
to the New York Senators, but it is offensive
to New York republicans.
The change of Badeau and Cramer, the two
appointments in which I felt a strong personal
interest, was very distasteful to me: the first,
because of our personal relations and my wish
that be should be kept where his office would
support him until he finishes some work he is
engaged upon, and which he could do without
interfering with his public duties. The second,
because it was at the expense of removing the
son of my old Secretary of State, who probably
never had his superior?certainly never for
moral worth?in the department. It Is true
Fish resigned. But he did this from a sense of
honor, supposing it to be the duty of representatives
abroad to give a new administration
the opportunity or saying whether they were
wanted or not. Very truly yours.

FOUR CYCLONES. 
St. Joseph, Mo.,'Juno in.—Sunday was a
terrible day for cyclones in the Northwest.
The atmosphere pressure was very great be­
tween 4 and 0 in tho afternoon, and, during
that one short hour, no less than three twist­
ers dealt death and destruction in ns many
paths. The first Hint came to tho knowledge
of tho Herald was from King City and
vicinity. This cyclone started near Sa­
vannah, in Andrew County.* Its course
was northeast, through Flag Springs
and King City. Many houses wore
destroyed, and not less than fourteen
lives lost In Amlrow County. At Flag
Springs and King City tho destruction was
much greater, tho loss of life in that vicinity
being probably fifty men, women, and chil­
dren. Tho public school* buildbig nt
Kiug City, a Inge brick, was razed
to its foundation. Hundreds of horses, cat­
tle, hogs, and sheep were killed, one man
losing eighty cattle, another sixty sheep,
another seven horses.

ANOTiIEII CVCLONK
started at Winslow*, Du Kalb County. An­
other started four miles southwest of Bosen­
duio, Andrew County, and passed eastward
one mile south of Boscndalc. Tho course of
all tho above cyclones was east by north­
east. Another started eight miles northwest
of Hopkins, hi Nodaway Comity, its course
for twelve miles being southeast. It was
one-fourth of a mile wide, and nothing es­
caped destruction in Us track. Many lives
have been lost In all of these cyclones, and
the destruction to property, which cannot
now ho estimated, is very groat.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84031492/1881-06-14/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,dlc_ogden_ver03,"","","",true,ca,Chicago daily tribune.,"","Chicago, Ill.","","",4446,6369,1994,4077,2,14868,19824,0,dlc_ogden_ver03/data/sn84031492/no_reel/1881061401/0002.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_ogden_ver03%2Fdata%2Fsn84031492%2Fno_reel%2F1881061401%2F0002.jp2/pct:29.903148,32.127724,13.411353,20.565981/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_ogden_ver03%2Fdata%2Fsn84031492%2Fno_reel%2F1881061401%2F0002.jp2/pct:29.903148,32.127724,13.411353,20.565981/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Sangamon county court house, in the days of
the old-fashioned slat settees, a tall, slim law­
yer, nop d for wearing a very short coat, slid
along on tlte seat to be nearer the advocate
addressing the jury. A protruding nail tore
the seat of the lawyer's pantaloons. Obliged
to follow his opponent immediately, there
was no time to sew up the rent in the gar­
ment. A legal wag present wrote a subscrip­
tion paper: ""We, the undersigned, agree to
pay tlte sums sot opposite fo our names for
the purpose of purchasing Brother Brown a
new pair of pantaloons."" Several of the
lawyers put down sums ranging from fifty
cents down to ten cents. Tlte paper was pre­
sented to Lincoln, who sat opposite the rear
of the advocate, who, bending over in gestic­
ulation, mail « quite au exposure. Lincoln
took out liis pencil and wrote upon the paper;
""/ hn re nothiny to contribute to the end in

the Judge asked to see the paper, when he,

Toledo tllade.
Wo had on board , na a matter ot
course , the betting young man from
Chicago. , No steamer ever sailedthat
did not have this young fellow aboard
and there is enough of them to last
the Atlantic for n great many years.
Ho . know everything thateverybody
thinks they know , but do not , and his
delight ' was to propound a iueiytand
then , when you had answered it , to
very coolly and cxaspcratingly re
mark.
""Bet ycr bottle of wine you'ro'
wrong. ""
The matter would bo so aimplo , nnd
one of so common repute , that immediately
orm
mediately you accepted the wager ,
only to find that in some minute par­
ticular you were wrong , and that the
knowing youth had won.
For instance : '
""Thompson , do you know how1
many states there nro in thu union j""
Now , any citkon of the United
States who votes , and is eligible to the
presidency , ought to know how many
states there are in his beloved coun­
try without thinking , but how many
can say , utf-hand V Ami so poor ,
Thompson answered :
""What a question ! Of course I
know. ""
"" Hut yer bottle yo don't. ""
""Done. ""
"" ""
""There
arc-
And then Thompson would find
himself figuring the very important
problem as to whether Colorado had
been admitted , and Nevada and Oregon
gen , and ho would decide that one had
and the other hadn't , and finally state
the number , with great certainty that
it was wrong.
The Chicago man's crowning bet oc­
curred the lost day out. The smoking-
room was tolerably full , as wcro the
occupants , and everybody was bored ,
as ! everybody is on the last day.The
Chicago man had been silent for an
hour , when suddenly ho broke out :
""Gentlemen ""
"" Oh , no more bets , "" was the excla­
mation of the cntifo party. ""Give
us a rest. ""
""I don't want to bet , but I can
show you something curious. ""
""Well ? ""
"" I say it and mean it. I can drink
a glass of water without it's goinc
down my throat. ""
""And get it into your stomach ! ""
""Certainly. ""
Tlicro was a silence of considerable
more than a minute. Every man in
the room had been victimized by this
gatherer of trifles , and there was
a general disposition to get the better
of him in some way if possible. Hero
was the opportunity. How could a
man get a glass of water into his sto­
mach without it going down his throat ?
Impossible ! And so the usual bottle
of wine was wagered , and the Chicago
man proceeded to accomplish the sup­
posed impossible feat. It was very
easily done.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99021999/1881-07-01/ed-1/seq-7,"","",7,"","",1,nbu_emerson_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Omaha daily bee.,Edward Rosewater,Omaha [Neb.],"","",7244,3455,2756,11573,7,22000,29868,4,nbu_emerson_ver01/data/sn99021999/0020653803A/1881070101/0555.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omaha%2C_Nebraska,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/nbu_emerson_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn99021999%2F0020653803A%2F1881070101%2F0555.jp2/pct:32.927273,11.567564,12.527273,38.747154/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/nbu_emerson_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn99021999%2F0020653803A%2F1881070101%2F0555.jp2/pct:32.927273,11.567564,12.527273,38.747154/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Old JLovers. I
[Little Rock Gazette.]

Several years, befora""tfa« war a young
man came to Little Rock and fell desper­
ately in loye with a young lady. The
gill's parents were rich. The young man
was poor. A union was impossile. The
girl prayed and the young man im­
plored, but the ruthless parents remained
firm. The young man went away. The
wareameon. The parents of the girl
died. Her uncle squandered the estate.
The
other day the lover came back and
inquired for the young lady. Age and
poverty had visited her, but she had* re­
mained true. They met and embraced.
""You were away so very long,"" she
said, leaning her tired head on his
shoulder. ""But you won't leave me
again. Those who kept us apart are
sleeping now.""
""I will never leave yon my biave dar­
ling. 1 have been trying for years to see
you.""

But they did nofmarry. The man got
her to wash six shirts for him, and ran
awsy without paying the bill. r.

The witness believed, judging by the
evidenco to which he had listened, in

and from the appearance and conduct
of the prisoner, that he was a sane
man. The hypothetical question was

into the court room this morning looking
paler than usual. He complained that he
had not slept well last evening. . A man
was placed in a cell near his who was suf­

caused by the excessive use of morphine
and during the whole night hi$ shrieks

and asked what was the occasion for such
a riot. The keeper replied: ""We have
got a crazy man on our hands to-night.
""""Well,"" said Guiteau, ""why don't you
choke him and make him keep quiet and
not let respectable ""people be disturbed in
this way by a miserable lunatic.""
Dr. McDonald again toot the stand this
morning and was cross examined by Sco­

to the subject of temporary,
insanity, witness was asked if in his prac­

charged for granting a false certificate of
health to m. M. Tweed when : the latter
was in confinement in the penitentiary, and
replied: ""I never gave to Tweed a certify

also closely observed him in court and
from his personal examination and Obser­

sane.
""Witness asked what he meant yesterday
by saying ""I think he (the prisoner) has

A Chicago Idyl.
From ths Chicago Tribune.)
""Must I really go, sweetheart ?""
""Yes,"" replied Lillian McGuire, placing
her shapely white hand in his, and looking
into his face with a tender earnestness that
showed the true womanliness of her nature ;
""it is better, far better for both of us that
we should part forever, "" but as she spoke the
hot tears of pain welled up into her beautiful
brown eyes those eyes that had witched
with their bright glances and dreamy tender­
ness so many men and with a little sob of
pain Lillian's head was bowed upon George
W. Simpson's shoulder in an ecstasy of
grief.
""Couldn't you puf a ten -year limit on your
bill, darling?"" asked the young man, bending
gently over the little head that was pillowed
so trustingly just under his left ear; ""I
certainly ought to have as good a chance as a
Chinaman.""
A low moan of pain and a convulsive shake
of the little head was the only response.
But George was not to be denied so easily.
""Can I not have one hope ?"" he said, ""one
little nickel plated, 10 cent hope ?""
Lillian lifted her head and looked at him
steadily. ""Perhaps,"" she said, in cold,
Baffin's Bay tones, ""you would drop if a
house fell on you, but I begin to doubt it.
Know then, since you will have it, that under
no circumstances can I ever accept your
proffered love, for I am a packer's daughter,
and packer's daughters come high"" this
with a haughty expression that lower-case
type cannot convey.
George W. Simpson saw at once that this
proud beauty had been making a plaything
of his love. The revelation- was a terrible
one, but he bore it bravely.
""Very well,"" he said, iu husky, haven't­
had a drink-in-two-hours tones. ""You have
stamped with the iron heel of scorn upon the
tender violet of my budding love, but some
day when your children little winsome brats
with sunny smiles and an assortment of
colic that will keep you up three nights every
yieek are climbing upon your knee until
you are in danger of becoming knee-sprung,
you will perhaps remember, with a tinge of
sadness in the recollection, how you toyed
with the love of a loyal, trusting, Cook
pounty heart and threw forever over a young
and hippy life the black pall of a disappoint­
ed hope and ci-shed ambition. I have seen
the roses of my Jove wither and
waste away until they lie shriveled
iud blighted by the dusty roadside
of )ife, end you can bet that I feel
pretty tough about it. I have seen my beau
tiful and stately ship of hope, with its tall,
shapely masts and towering wings of snowy
canvas, that' sailed away so buoyantly and
bravely over the shimmering sea not many
months ago, come back to me a shapeless
wreck the tapering spars that were so white
and clean now jagged and broken, and to
them clinging the dark seaweeds, while of
the sails that rivalled the clouds in fleecy
purity there remain only blackened shreds","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015483/1882-05-02/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,ct_gum_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Morning journal and courier.,J.B.

Fourteen year ago, when Chester A.
Arthur was a struggling local politi­
cian in New York of what is known
there as the Custom House variety, he
numbered among his friends the mate
of a vessel, named Kennedy, irhose
influenoo Arthur had often occa?itn
to use when circumstances required
the votes ofthe floating population of
tne barber Iront.
Just about that time Arthur made
an unsuccessful effort to obtain some
minor municipal appointment. The
mate condoled with his friend upon
his disappointment, and noon after
sailed for Washington with a cargo of
hardware. While ascending the Po­
tomac a blook and tackle fell upon the
mates head, indenting his skull in
suoh a manner that the man became
praotically an idiot, and w.3 placed in
the District of Columbia Insane Asy­
lum. A short time ago the famous
surgeon Dr. Gros, of Philadelphia,
visited the asylum, examined the case
and straightway performed an opera­
tion invented by himself, which re­
suited in the almost immediate return
of the patient's reason, the intervening
fourteen years boing, of course, a
complete blank.
A day or two after his recovery
the mate walked out and began
strolling through the capitol building.
Almost the first person lie encountered
was President Arthur, who was just
leaving tho Kxccutivo chamber in the
Senate wing.
""Why, how aro you, Kennedy?"" said
the first citizen, affably extending his
hand. ""Glad to see you.""
""Howdy, old man, ' said the sailor.
""Dow'b things? Got a job yet?""
V ell, I believe I have, said tho
Exeoutive, with a smile. ""A pretty
big job, too. You mast come up to
the Whito House and see me.""
""To the White House?"" repeated
the amazed mariner.
""Yes. just ask for my private secre­
tary, and he'll show you right in,"" and
the President walked on.
""Poor old Chet! olean gone, clean
gone,"" mused the mate. ""Actually
bolieves himself President of the Uni­
ted Slates. Smart man once, too.
That lust shows you, gentlemen,"" ho
continued, turning to the bystanders,
""that just shows you what politics and
disappointment will bring a man to.
Poor old Chet!""

Every noble activity makes room ;
for itself. A great mind is a good
sailor, as a great heart is.
We do not count a man's years un­
til ho has nothing else to couut.
Books are the beet things, well
used; abused, among tiic worst.
Trust men and they will be true
to you; treat men greatly and they
will show themselves great.
An eye can threaten like a loaded
and leveled gun, or can insult like
hissing and kicking; or, in its alter*
ered mood, by beams of kindness, it
cun make the heart dance with joy.
Nature never sends a great man
into the planet without confiding the
secrets to another soul.
Light is tho first of painters.?
There is no object so foul that intense
light will not make it beautiful.
Good manners are made up of pet­
ty sacrifices.
The writer, like a priest, must be
exempted from secular labor. His
work needs a frolic health. He must
I be at the top of his condition.
Tnere is no true orator who is not
a hero.
No man ever played heartily with­
out learning something.
There is a remedy for every wrong
and a satisfaction for every soul.
He only is a well mado man who
has a good determination.

Scientific Gossip.
Phosphor bronze has an electric con­
ductivity two and a half times that of
iron or steel, and one third that of cop­
per.
The Edgemoor Iron Company, of
Wilmington, Del., have finished the
Bowra bridge over the Ghoalhavcn r' v­
cr. New South Wales. This bridge is
the largest in the colonv, being 1,103
feet long and 20 feet wide. It is built
of iron.
The longest span of wire in the world
is used for a telegraph in India,
over the River Kistnah, between Be­
zorah and Sectanagrum. It is more
than 6.000 feet long, and is stretched be­
tween two hills, each of which is 1,200
feet high.
With thermometers placed at four feet
and at fifty feet above the ground, Mr.
Geo. Dines ha* obtained readings which
led him to believe that the average max­
imum temperature for every month is
always greater and the average mini­
mum lower near the ground than at a
considerable elevation.
Experiments have shown that firing
with a 9-inch 12-ton gun at armor plat­
ing three and four inches thick, repre­
senting a deck of a vessel inclined be­
tween 10 degrees and 15 degrees, in no
instance caused penetration, although
full charges were used.
Preliminary measures have been taken
for the construction of an electric rail­
way at Tunis. The rolling stock of
each train will consist of four cars, each
provided with an electric motor and ca­
pable of carrying forty passengers.—
The cars will be driven by four dynamo­
electric machines, lighted by electricity,
and stopped instantaneously by electric
brakes.
From observations made during many
years in Senegal and other intertropical
regions in Africa, Dr. A. Corre is in­
clined to believe that the African blacks
are destined in course of time to disap­
pear and be supplanted by a superior
race of European immigrants. Be­
yond the possession of immunity apainst
yellow fever and malaria, he thinks
the blacks in every way inferior to the
whites.
Starch is much more readily converted
into sugar when under pressure than
otherwise. Not only, says a contempo­
rary, is the diastatic action of the solu­
ble albmueuoids increased, but when the
pressure is great the small percentage
of free acid which is found in all cereals
is sufficient to convert rapidly the starch
into sugar. It is matter of surprise,
therefore, that brewers do not mash un­
der pressure.

A description of the method of observ­
ing meteors at the summit of thopuy de
Dome has been read by M. Alluard* be­
fore the Academy of Sciences, Paris.—
A circular terrace with balustrade has
been formed around the tower. The
balustrade is divided into 3(50 degrees,
the north being marked 0 degree? and
the localities all around are referred to
this gradation. Two terrestrial tele­
scopes are supported on chariots run­
ning on rails round the terrace. Geo­
graphical maps are constructed, hav­
ing concentric circumferences round
the Puy de Dome. The origin and

It is surprising how everybody rushes
at a tainting person and strives to raise
him up. and es|»ecially to keep his head
* n et. There niu>t tie an instinctive ap­
prehension that if a person seized with
afaiutimror other tit fall into the re­
t unilfnl position death is more immi­
nent. I must have driven a mile to­
day while a lady fainting was held up­
right. 1 found her pulseless, white, and
ap|>arently dying, and I believe that if I
had delayed"" ten minutes longer she
would really have died. I laid her head
down on a lower level than her body,
and immediately color returned to her
| li(»and cheeks, and she became cou­
1 scious. To the excited gr*»uj» of friends
1 said: Always remember this fact—
namely: fainting is caused by a want
of blood in the brain; the heart ceases
toaet with sufficient force to send the
u>ual amount of blood to the
brain, and hence the person loses
consciousness because the function of
| the brain ceases. Restore the blood to
J the brain and instantly the person re­
, covers. Now, though the blood is pro­
pelled to all parts of the l>ody by the ac­
tion of the heart, yet it is still under the
j influence of the laws of gravitation. In
I the erect position the blood ascends to
i the head against gravitation, and the
supply to the brain is diminished, as
I compared to the recumbent iHMition,
i | the heart's pulsation being equal. If,
| i then, you place a j>erson sitting whose
! heart has nearly ceased to beat, his
■ brain will fail to receive blood, while if
J you lay him down, with the head lower
than the heart, blood will run into the
brain by the mere force of gravity; and,
| i in tainting, in sufficient quantity to re­
l | store consciousness. Indeed, Nature
teaches us how to manage the fainting
, ! i*tsoes, for they always fall, and fre­
i ! <|Ucntly are at once restored by the re­
1 cumbeut position into, which they are
I thrown.

raised on carp.

My opinion has often been asked bow
a carp pond should be constructed for
family use. Tbe pond oan be made in
any shape to suit the locality, but I
would prefer

egg

shape, if tbe locality

was just as suitable for it. The pond
would breed fliee of a great many kinds,
one of tbe kinds being mosquitoes. Tbe
larva of all flies is tbe best food tor young
fish. I have bred tbem by tbe bushel,
but some of tbe mosquitoes would be apt
to take wing before tbe pond got well
stocked with young fish, and to protect
the family in a measure I would advise
building tbe pond to the leeward of tbe
house in the prevailing winds of tbe lo­
cality. If, for instance, tbe prevailing
wind was from the west, the pond shoalc
be built to tbe east northeast or south­
east of tbe bouse. I would prefer tbe
pond to be northeast or southeast, be­
cause if plaoed directly to the east, the
bouse would make a lee under which
tbe mosquitoes could easily reach
it. The mosquito can beat
any sailing craft before the wind
but on the wind they are nowhere on
tbe race, aa they have no keel. The
whale human tamJy should be thankful
to the Creator for not putting a keel on
them, aud if their bosrsprit baa not been
quite so sharp they might not receive so
many handkerchief salutes from the
verandahs of the Long Island hotels,
but would be just as useful and orna­
mental.

The pond can be constructed with
plow and scraper. It should have
aeep place in the center, and be shallow
on the edges. If you bave square sides
the young fish wiU have no protection
from the old ones. When scraping is
commenoed carry the dirt as far back as
you intend making the lower outside of
your embankment, and keep scraping
until the pond is four to six
feet deep in the center.
If the locality is inch that the ice freeaes
very thick, tbe pond should be made
deeper and holea kept open through the
ice during tbe winter to keep the fish
from suffocating. If the embankment is
raised three feet and pounded down and
sodded or sown to grass, the water could
be taised so that but three feet in the
center would have to be excavated
order to have a pond aix feet deep. The
whole pond should be so vn with some
kind of grass or water-plant with tbe ex­
ception of about fifty or seventy-five feet
square iu tbe center Tbe grass and
water-planta make tbe spawning grounds,
breed food and protect tbe yonug. The
pond should not oontain any other kind
of fish, and if tbe grass gets too thick it
can be raked out.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn91099608/1882-10-13/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,sdhi_avenger_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Press and daily Dakotaian.,Bowen & Kingsbury,"Yankton, Dakota Territory [S.D.]","","",10027,8907,2356,8160,1,18765,25024,3,sdhi_avenger_ver01/data/sn91099608/00415665374/1882101301/1646.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yankton%2C_South_Dakota,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/sdhi_avenger_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn91099608%2F00415665374%2F1882101301%2F1646.jp2/pct:53.434586,35.593830,12.555289,32.608696/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/sdhi_avenger_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn91099608%2F00415665374%2F1882101301%2F1646.jp2/pct:53.434586,35.593830,12.555289,32.608696/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

How a Whale Breathes.
The windpipe does not communicate
with the mouth ; a hole is, as it were,
bored right through the back of the
head. Engineers would do well to
copy the action of tint valve of the
whale's blow-hole ; a more perfect
piece of structure it is impossible to
imagine. Day and night, asleep or
awake, the whale works his breathing
apparatus in Htich a manner
that not a drop of- water
ever gets down into his
lungs. Again, the whale must of ne­
cessity stay a much longer period of
time under water than seals ; this alone
might possibly drown him, inasmuch
as the lungs cannot have access to
fresh ait. We find that this difficulty
has been anticipated and obviated by
a peculiar reservoir in the venous sys­
tem, which reservoir is situated at the

Mrs. Sargent, aged eighty-four, living
alone at Fort Ann, was found beaten
death about two years ago. Large re­
wards were offered for the arrest of tho
murderer. A man named Stewart was
arrested on suspicion, but as there was
no evidence against him the case was
dropped. The strange and almost in­
credible revelation has now been made
that a photograph of the dead woman's
eyes disclosed upon the retina a picture
of Stewart holding a chair over her head
and just in the act of striking her. The
matter has been brought to the attention
of the grand jury, and Stewart, who has

Itemnrkablc Surgery.
AVe have referred to the wonderful
success of surgery, witliin these latcr
years, in operations the most skil'ed
would not havo dared attenipt a gen­
eration ago. Such aro the relnoval of
tholarynx (vocal 1 -k), supplying its
placo with a uietaluo subhtitute; cut­
ting out the larg.'r ortion of the
stomach and bringing the divided parts
successfully togettier; tho samo with
soveral feet of intestinis ; tho saving
of a liand for fcervice, most of tlie
l ones of wliich had been crushcd bc­
neath a huge trip-hammer.
These and kindred facts aro of in­
terest, not simply as illustrating tho
advanco made iu surgical skill and
daring, but as suggosting tho amazing
resources of tlu jihysii-'al t.ystem for
the repair of injury.
Internal ailments onco thought to
bo inevitably fatal, and large abscesses
i'ormcrly diilicult of cure, can now
cspecially with the aid of disitifectants
be liandled with comparativo easo,
ether or somo other anusthetic con­
tributing to tho succe3.s of tho opera­
tion by giving tho operator a moro ab­
soluto control of his subject.
These facts encouiago tho unfor­
tunato and their friends to liopo for
tho best in tho most trying circum­
btances; and they condemn tlioso phy­
sieians who hastily adviso tho sacrillco
of an important part of tho body. AVo
havo no doubt that many who camo
out of the war maimed might havo
savod their lost llinbs.
Tlio following remarkable casi oc­
curred about three yeirsago in Xortli
Carolina. A white, delicato girl bal
her hand completely severed lrom the
nrm by an a'c. Tho physician, not
being in a condition to amputate tho
arm abovo tho wrist, roplaued the
hand, securing it with silver stitches
and adheslvo plaster, and having
bound both arm and hand to a bro id
splint, ordored them to bo kept warm
with hot llannel cloth. Tho third day
pulsation could bo plainly felt in tho
hand, which had also changed its
color. Says tho physidan in charge;
""I removed tho sutures on tho four­
teenth day, and afterward sho carried
the hand in a sliug, and is now threo
month3 after tho accident ablo to ex­
tend tho flngers and grasp with nearly
tho usual strength."" Tho joint ro­
tainrd its freo motion.

FAR APART.
Beneath the quaint old bridge you hear
The waves make music as they pass;
And winding to the elm tree near,
You see the pathway through the grass
YVhere we were wont to walk, alas!
The river wanders as of old
Beneath the shade of willow trees;
The sunlit waters gleam like gold.
And ripple to the gentle breeze;
But I am far from thee and these!
The sky bends over, broad and blue.
And in the soft and mellow light
You tread the lane our footsteps knew
in former times, when days were bright;
Do these days bring such sweet delight?
And still that lane with grass is green.
With fragrant flowers the banks are fair;
In golden gloss and silver sheen
The bees still haunt the balmv air;
But you will fail to find me there.
Again, perchance, I may not see
The rustling rows of willow trees
< Which lent a leafy canopy
When we strolled underneath at ease);
For I am far from thee and these.
Our joys forsake us. Soon does spring
Pass by and for the summer call;
Soon do the birds lose heart to sing.

??80 Jones is dead?"" said one Somerville
man to another.
""Yrs, poor fellow,"" was the reply, ""he's
itone.""
""What did he die of?"" inquired the first
speaker.
""Starvation,"" was the answer. ?
""Starvation! Good gracious, the man
was worth $50,000.
""1 know thai; nevertheless, he died of
starvation. I'll tell you how it was. Jones
was always fancying that there was some*
thins the matter with him; so he went to a
doctor one day and bad himself examin­
ed, and the doctor informed him that he
bad kidney disease, and that, besides tak­
ing medicine,'he-must diet himself. Said
the doctor: ""You must avoid all kinds of
Halt meats, salt fish, potatoes, cabbage and
vegetables of every kind."" Jones followed
the advice, but found himself no better. He
went to another doctor, aud after beinjj ex­
amined was informed that he must avoid all
kinds of fresh meats. This did not do him
any good, as he thought, and he went to an­
other doctor, who.highly approved of the
advice which had previously been given,
and further warned him against all kind*
of pastiy, likewise shell-flab, including
oysters and clams. 'The best thing for you
is a milk diet,'said this doctor; so Jones
lived wholly upon milk. Not feeling him­
self any better he went to another doctor,
who cautioned him to avoid milk above all
things if he wanted to get well. This re­
duced Jones to a diet of cold water and
freBh air, and, finding himself no better
under this regime, he went to another doc­
tor, who advised him to beware of drink­
ing too much water and being too much in
the air. This last advice cut off the last of
Jones' articles of diet, and he died of star­
vation, as I have told you.""","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026844/1883-07-19/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,wvu_eritrea_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Wheeling daily intelligencer.,Campbell & M'Dermot,"Wheeling, W.

—The Swiss railroad companies now
cover a portion of their carriages with a
phosphorescent preparation, which
makes them visible at night.

—A Boston engineer has been turning
his attention to the power going to
waste in the Niagara River. He esti­
mates that a motor could bo submerged
in the river which would furnish half a
million horse-power—sufficient to run
all the machinery in Buffalo and pump
all the city's water. His plan is to place
a giant iron wheel in the river perpen­
dicularly, so that it shall be turned by
the current. The power would be taken
from the shaft of the wheel by either
belts or gearings, or would be sent
through electric cables.—N. Y. Sun.
—It is reported that a firm in Paris
lias patented an engine for the instan­
taneous formation of steam, so that it
can be used at once in the cylinder of
the engine. A pump sends the required
quantity of water between two plate
surfaces, which are heated, and between
which there is only capillary space. The
liquid, spreading into a thin layer, evap­
orates instantly without goino; into the
so-called spheroidal state, and thesteam
acts in the cylinder as fresh formed
steam. The speed of the pump is regu­
lated bv the engine.

—Down in Georgia gasoline lias been
put to a new use} A mechanic of Au­
gusta is constructing a steam buggy, in
which the boilers will be heated by two
gasoline burners. The buggy has three
wheels, the first being extra large, and
bearing the burden of the machinery.
The vehicle will carry several persons,
and the engine can be worked with
ease by anyone inside ; and can also be
guided in any direction at the will ol
the operator. Its average speed is esti­
mated at a mile in three minutes. It
will no doubt make a good companion
piece for the steam man in the patent
office.—Chicago Inter- Ocean.
—For the treatment of both hard and
soft corns Dr. Trail Green speaks high­
ly of the use of salicylic acid. He has
adopted a formula recommended by Dr.
Gezon, which is as follows: Salicylic
acid, thirty parts ; extract Canabi* in­
dica, five parts; collodion, two hundred
parts. The collodion fixes the acid on
the diseased part and gives speedy re­
lief by protecting it from friction. The
Canabis indica acts as an anodyne. The
acid loosens the corn so that it comes
off in four or five days, adhering to the
collodion. If any portion of the corn
remains, the acid should be applied
again, and the treatment continued un­
til the whole of the corn has disap­
peared.—San Francisco Chronicle.

FOBTVnUtO?! GERH8.
A Wonderful Hi??ryHliat Concern* the
Welfare, Happiaem and Life
ef Everyone.
In his quiet and cosy libra*? at the clow of a busy
day sat a gentleman and his wife, he absorbed In a new
book and she in the newspaper. Quickly glancing
toward her husband, she asked, at a certain point in the
article,
"" John, what is the germ theory ? *
""The germ theory?well?y?s; Just look In the encyclopedia
under 'Germ,' that will explain It so much
better than I can.""
Accordingly his wife opened the book at the word
named and read: Germ Theory of Disease?A theory ad- I
vanoedbythe ablest and best investigators andscien- I
tists of the times. It supposes the surface of the earth, I
the air and water to be inhabited to a greater or leas ex- I
tent with a peculiar growth of the lowest form of fungi, I
commonly termed bacteria,whose power of reproduction, I
under favorable conditions, is so great that a single germ I
will increase to fifteen million in twenty-four hours* I
time, and unchecked in its increase would grow to a I
mass of eight hundred tons, in three days1 time, if space I
and food be furnished. There is no condition under I
which it can be said to be absent, unless it be from fire I
or air filtered through cotton-batting in numerous I
layers. A single drop of water containing a germ, put I
into water boiled, filtered and thus freed from bacteria, I
will grow murky in a day or two from the develop- I
opment of new germs. When it is considered that I
it requires about forty billion to weigh one grain, I
some remote idea can *be had of the oapacity I
of germ reproduction. Professor John Tyndall, in a I
ate work, elaborately treats of the influence of germs I
n the propagation of disease and charges upon this cause, I
the inception and development of very many of the ail- I
ments most injurious to man. Professor Pasteur, an
eminent French savant, has carried his original and
beautiful experiments so far, and from them deduced I
such practical results as very greatly to diminish the I
number of cases of anthrax among sheep and chicken I
cholera among fowls,?proving his theory that these are I
essentially and actually germ diseases. These germs are J
carried into the system through the lungB, the stomach
and possibly the skin, but through the lnngs chiefly.
Once in the system, they begin to develop, poisoning the I
blood, Invading the nerve centers, disturbing the func- I
tional activity of the great organs of the body and in- I
ducinga general impairment of the vital processes. I
These are the cause of fevers, rheumatism. Bright dis- I
ease of the kidneys, pneumonia, blood poisoning, liver I
disease, diphtheria and many other ailments. Lately I
Professor Koch, a famous German physician, has proved
that consumption of the lungs is due to thi? cause?the I
presence of a peculiar germ.
When the circulation is bounding, the nerves elastic I
and the system all aglow with life and enerjfy, the germs I
seem to develop poorly, if at all. But with weakened
nerves, poor digestion or malassimilation","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1883-10-06/ed-1/seq-6,"","",6,"","",1,dlc_newfoundland_ver04,"","","",true,ca,Evening star.,W.D.

conciliatory spirit. The government of
Obiua, seeing that the countries are well

settlement of the question as to whether
Touquin isiu a Chinese dependency, and

defensive ones, and above all, an under­

on u sudden impulse. ""I love my

with dillicultv getting her words out.

Gaee, recoiling, ami flashing' a terrible
look upon her.
""No I mean 1 did not know this. I

jMgirard look around as she put her
hand to her head.
""Please to tell me ' Grace had
begun, when the silence outside was
suddenly broken by the sound of wheels,
pid. strange though it might seem in
the intensity of their present feelings,
bo'h tlie girls looked eagerly out of the
window, for. deep in ""the foreground
of both minds, lurked the unspoken
fear: ""What if Philip, by any chance,
were to arrive to-day--now?"" And
C J race, seeing a cab drive up. and the
driver thereof scanning the numbers on
the hou-e-doors, uttered the fear which
paralysed Mabelle's lips.

ens I believe it is Philip!'
Still no answer from Mabelle, while
Grace ru-hed to the window and found
that her fear was right the cab stopped

and looking like a foreigner much

toward the house, throwing some coin
to :.':e cabman, and striding up the
steps. It. was then that the full force of
the situation bur.-t upon both girls.

f Grace hurried forth the words, and,
losing lier presence of mind, began to
walk hurriedly about, wringing her
hands and muttering:

shall I do? What a wck-oiuo home! My

if Philip's indignation should take a
violent shape.
""Wc only knew this morning just
now,"" said a voice at his elbow. ""And
this is what told us.""
It was Mabelle who put Angela's let­
ter into his hand, which Philip took in
silence, not deigning to reply to what,
he told himself, was a foul and atro­
cious lie.
But in the act of reading, his head,
which was clear enough, comprehend­
ed quickly the whole state of the case.

lie neither swore, nor raved, nor
stamped; but both the girls trembled
as he stepped up to the lire, tearing the
paper across, and tossing it into the
blaze, while Ire said in a low voice:
"" I thought I was loved by a pure­
hearted woman, but it seems that I
have been fooled and jilted b3 a coarse
ha, ha!""
It was a dreadful, bitter little laugh.
It sent the blood rushing over Grace's
face; it elicited a faint moan only from
Mabelle, which sound caused Grace to
turn to her once more, saving:
""Oh. Mabelle, if you h:fd but told""
Philip looked at the girl indifferently,
as if she and hers were henceforth be­
neath his notice, or even his contempt.
But when he saw nothing but a limp,
lifeless-looking white figure, crouched
in a sort of unconscious heap against
the table, he strode forward and raised
her up, and carried her in his arms to
the sofa.
""Ho reproaches here, Grace. Don't
3ou see she has fainted. Healths girls
are not in the habit of fainting, even for
things like this. She has gone through
something that has been too much for
her more than she could bear. Look
to her, that's a good girl. I'll cany her
upstairs, if you like, but don't let me
see her again or, stop,"" he added,
serenely, "" I'll go down to the office. It
seems there is nothing better for me to
do now. Yes, I'll go""down to the office
and report myself. I shall be back some
time this evening, Grace.""
And with that he was gone.
CHAPTEK XVI.
UEACTIOX. m
He was gone, and to Grace the room
seemed strangely silent and empty. It
did not appear as if he had only"" been
there a few brief moments, and had
then di.-appeared again, but rather as
if he had been there a very long time,
and now that he had departed she could
not get accustomed to his absence.
While she bent over the unconscious
Mabelle. and tended her, and sum­
moned her landlady to help her, and
listened to the loud and forcible excla­
mations of the latter, Grace's thoughts
were wholly occupied with Philip. How
happy! how handsome and eager he
had looked as ho came in, so full of
health and prosperity, of hope and jo-!
What a white dismal change had settled
over his face as he read Angela's letter,
and in those words of his, as he burnt
that letter, what a curse there l:ry!
What trenchant, bitter, uncompromis­
ing contempt! Grace took comfort in
the remembrance: for his looks, words
and gestures had not been those of a
man who would succumb under the
most treacherous blow.
No wonder this poor little girl had
lost consciousness altogether, thought
Grace she, the unhappy little partici­
pator in the secret, worn and unstrung
l3"" weeks of foreboding and anxiet3.
Had not Grace herself, innocent and
clear ot con-cience, felt her cheeks burn
and her heart beat with terror as she
heard him speak, and trembled more at
what he implied than at what he actu­
a.113 said?
B3- slow degrees Mabelle regained
consciousness, and when she was fully
restored to her senses it filled Grace's
heart with compunction to see the
change which had taken place. Now
that the terror was over, that the storm
had broken, all her factitious strength
gave way: the enforced energy which
had sustained her collapsed, and the
languor which oppressed her limbs were
overpowering.
""Has he gone? Has Philip gone, or
is he here 3-ct?"" she asked, with a re­
turn of her terrified, hunted look.
""He has gone, child, tie will not
return till evening. Lie still and drink
this wine.""
Mabelle shook her head, passed her
hand across her forehead, and said,
pressing her head wearily upon the
hard, little sofa pillow:
""No, thank 3-011. My head aches
oh, dreadfully! And I am so tired. I
don't feel very well, and I don't think
I can go to school this afternoon.""
""Go to school! 1 should think not!
You will lie still here, and I shall sit be­
side 3-ou, and no one will interrupt us.
Yes. Mrs. Livscy, 3-011 mav bring in din­
ner, and set a place for Miss Fairfax,
because she will .-ta3' with me.""
But she could not prevail upon Ma­
belle to touch food: onh'to lie still upon
the sofa until Grace had made some
pretense of a meal, and then neither
threats nor persuasions would induce
the young girl to .-t:iya moment longer.
She would go into their own lodgings
""and rest.'she said.
Grace said firmly that she did not
think her fit to be left alone, and would
go with her. but this Mabelle also de­
clined: and all Grace could extract
from her was a promise that she would
send for her if she should not feel better
in the evening. She waichcdherout of
the house a slight, drooping, broken-
looking 3'oung hgure anu.shesutmenly
remembered how she had drawn Philip
to the window that Monday morning
after her arrival, and had asked hini
who that bright, prett 3-oung girl was
who walked so uprightly The remem­
brance of that happy morning, and of
all that had passed since, overpowered
Grace. Flinging herself upon the
couch on which Mabelle had been
tying, she covered her face with her
hands, and wept sore.
Toward six o'clock came a note from
Philip, dated from the office.
'Dkakkst C hack I tlnd I shall not be ablo
to come up to ""Lawrence street: this evening.

from the next house came in, request­
ing to see her, and told her that Miss
Fairfax appeared to be very ill, and, as
her sister was away, would Miss Mas­
se come in, and sa3' what she thought
ought to be done?
(trace complied, and found Mabelle
restlcssr, Hushed, feverish, and, as it
seemed to her, ver' ill, indeed. She
made her go to bed, sent for a doctor,
took her place lieside Mabelle's bed.
and, as it eventually proved, did not
leave her for a fortnight. Mabelle was
sick almost ""unto death,"" and to desert
her Grace's heart must have been
hardJr than it was. She nursed the
girl tenderly, making light of tho ill­
ness in the accounts which she was
compelled to send to Angela sorelj'
against her will.
During the first days of convales­
cence she heard from Mabelle's lips the
whole story of her struggles and trials,
and before her task was over she hail
grown to love her patient as dearly as
a sister.
"" Whatever the rest of the world
may be, she is guiltless.""
She echoed Philip's words from the
bottom of her heart.-

AT Mil. OREV'S.
Philip left the house, toward the mo­
ment ot entering which he had A'earned
so cagerbj, and lor such long anil weary
week's, and passed out into the street
again. During the ten minutes or
quarter of an hour which had elapsed
since he had driven up to the door, no
great convulsion of nature had taken
place. Was it likeh that aii3-thiug of
the kind should have occurred? And
3'et it seemed to Philip, and no doubt
would have so seemed to nine men out
of ten in his position, amazing that
everything should look just as it hail
done before the sun still shining with
April brightness the people quietly
passing up and down the familiar street;
even one or two faces that he knew; an
ugly omnibus conductor with one e3""e,
there he was, in his old place, as the
vehicle went down. All outside was as
before; it was only within himself.
PhUip Massey, that such awful stupen­
dous changes seemed to have taken
place.
Of course, he did not in the least
realize what had happened yet; but he
knew there was some horrible calamity
in the distance which hung over him
and oppressed him iTkc a distantthunder-cloud
in a summer sky. The cloud
would roll up, and burst in a storm. So
would his calam'ty roll up soon, and
burst upon his mind in full lorce. False­
hood, treachery, the most hideous,
frightful lies the basest, vilest in­
triguessoon ne would have to grasp
it all, and understand that they hail all
been practiced--all these abomlnat ons
by the woman whom he had setup in his
heart as in a shrine, ami worsh neil with
his whole soul. He shuddered a little
in anticipation of the coming horror,
but managed to stave it off' for the pres­
ent, and to arrive at the well-known
office, looking tranquil anilself-possessed.
He went into the room full of clerks,
who looked up as he entered, and one
of them began civillv:
""What can I why, Philip Massey!
So it is. Are 3'ou back, old fellow! and
how are -ou?""
Heart3 hand-shakes and warm greet­
ings from all his old friends, and the
admiring glances of new hands fol­
lowed, after which Philip suggested
that he would like to see Mr. Siarkie,
and was straightway ushered into that
gentleman's private room.
Here, too, the greetings were warm,
for Philip had done well the work which
had been intrusted to him, and b3' his
promptitude, decision and presence of
mind had saved his firm from considera­
ble pecuniary loss as well as losses in
reputation which would have been more
serious to them; and they, being liberal
men, were rc:uly to acknowledge good
service of whatever kind.
While Phil-) was deep in explanations
to Mr. Starkie, and feeling an occasion­
al slight shiver as there started across
his mind a sense of what was awaiting
him when tlie excitement should be
over, and he alone with himself and his
thoughts, in the midst of this Mr. Grej
entered. Mr. Gic was a handsome,
broad-shouldered, distinguished looking
young man of about thirty, said to be
somewhat reserved and distant, but
whom Philip had :wa-s liked in the
slight and rare intercourse he had ever
had with him. He greeted Philip with
cordiality, entered into conversation
with him, and interested in what Philip
told him, invited him to return with him
that afternoon to his house, spend a
couple of nights with him, and be in­
troduced to his wife.
At an- other time the prospect would
have been distasteful to Philip, or
rather, his heart, which was warm and
simple, as true men's hearts are, would
have rebelled at the idea of going to
strange houses, and visiting strange
persons, while he hail scarce spoken
half a dozen words to his favorite sister,'
and his father and mother, at home at
Foulhaven, did not even know that he
was again in his native land. But these
circumstances were quite abnormal.
The idea of getting into completely now
scenes and places was a tempting one.
He accepted Mr. Gre3''s invitation, and
sent to Grace the note which has al­
ready been spoken of.
Calliards, Mr. Grc3's place, was
some eight or nine miles out of Irkford,
a pleasant spot in the fresh, unpolluted
countn, with purple moors and green
woods around it. Mr. Grcj' drove there
when bu-iness was over, and the drive
through the April evening was pleasant
the air was cool, the sun was setting
with clear beams and casting long
shadows; they bowled swiftly along the
pleasant country roads, and"" turned in
before it w:is dusk along a limestone
diive with a fir plantation on e'thcr
side, and up to a large, pleasant, irregu­
lar gra- stone house. Thev- entered
through'a tiled hall into abright-looking
sitting-room, in which a lady sat
embroidering, to whom Philip was in­
troduced this was Lad Elizabeth
Gre3
Philip's troubles really seemed, for
the time to melt into the background as
he stood talking to this handsome, up­
right, unaffected girl, of some one or
two-and-twenty years of age.
""My dear,"" ""Mr. Grey had said, ""let
me introduce Mr. Massey, a gentleman
who has been doing great things for us
out in China Masse Ladv Elizabeth
Grey.""
""1 must reallv shake hands with you
ESSctf-
,. r.-i. .

if vou have been doing great things,""
said Lad' Elizabeth, pleasantly. ""Has
Mr. Masse' come to stay, Dick?""
""He can stay a couple of days, he
says, and I dare say he can tell -ou ad­
ventures enough to satisfy even you,
for he has been in a wild part of the
world. Is that the t-ressing-beli? We
are later than I thought.""
""It is the dressing-bell, and by the
way, there, are some people coming to
dinner. I wonder who I shall give you
to take in to dinner, Mr. Massey. what
sort of young ladies dp 'ou like?""
""I shall be sure to like an' 3-oung
lady you may choose for me,"""" replied
Philip, with a sudden flush and a sud­
den spasm of pain at his heart; but he
found that this pain was still quite with­
in his control. He could bear it with­
out any contortions of countenance, and
even while it was gnawing most fiercely
could smile and talk as it at peace anil
charity with all men.
Then he was taken up-sfairs and left
to dress, which operation he hurried
over as rapidly as possible, dreading
ever' five minutes alone with himself
and that specter which was ready to
spring out upon him in the first un

guarded moment.
Next came dinner, and the pleasant,
sociable evening, during which Philip,
to his great surprise, found himself
quite a lion in a small way, and had
enough to do in answering the in­
numerable questions put to him by two
very engaging young ladies, who pro­
fessed to take a great interest in China
and all pertaining'to it, but whose chief
anxiety appeared to bo to learn what
specimens of pottery or other curiosities
he had brought with him from the
Celestial Land.
""I like your Mr. Massey, Dick,""
said Lady Elizabeth, in a moment's
aside with her husband. ""He has ono
of the best faces I ever saw, as well as
one of the handsomest.""
""Yes; I'm glad you like him, but I
think his manner is rather odd some­
times. Don't you observe how every
now and then he almost starts, and
looks suddenly around, as if it's diffi­
cult to describe the expression. And ho
has been gazing intently at Miss Wood­
side for the last two minutes, without
hearing a word she said.""
""Oh, yes, I have noticed it. But
didn't you say he had only arrived at
home to-day? And you have dragged
him oft"" here, when I dare say he would
much rather be somewhere else, orwith
some one else.""
"" Trne! I never thought of that. It
is likely euough.""
""Aud-etit is not a year since 3'ou
would have said it was very hard to be
dragged off' somewhere else, when -ou
might have gone to Clevely Park,"" re­
torted Lady Elizabeth, maliciously.
The evening came to an end very
soon, as it .-eemed to Philip, and when
the part"" had dispersed, and the others
retired, lie was naturally obliged to do
1 ne same, uiougn lie imgereu as long as
he could, accepted his host's invitation
to come and have a 1 igar in thesmoking-room,
and so on, so that it waspa-t
midnight when he at last found himself
alone in his room.
But once here, he felt that the an­
guish which had so long been as it were
staved olf at arm's length could be so
averted no longer. It all came over
him with a rush, and overwhelm'
him.
rO BE CONTINUED.
The Use of Salt.
We hav; received ftom a correspond­
ent a letter making some inquiries into
the u-e of salt, and we are given to un­
derstand that among other foll'es of the
da' some indiscreet persons are object­
ing to the use of salt and propose to dc
without it. Nothing could be more at
surd. Common salt is the most wide
distributed substance in the body; it ex­
ists in every l'.u d and in every solid:
and not only is everywhere present, but
in almost every part it constitutes the
largest portion of the ash when any
tissue is burnt. In particular it is a
constant constituent of the blood, and
it maintains in it a proportion that is
almost wholly independent of the quan­
tity that is consumed with the lood.
The blood will take up so much
and no more, however much we
mav take with our food; and, on the
other hand, if none be given, the blood
parts with its natural quantity slowly
and unwillingly. Under ordinary cir­
cumstances a licalthy man loses ""daily
about twelve grains by one channel or
the other, and, if he is to maintain his
health, that qtlantit is to be intro­
duced. Common salt"" is of immense im­
portance in the processes ministering
to the nutrition of the body, for not
onh' is it the chief salt in the gastric
juice, and essential for the formation
of bile, and may hence be reasonably
regarded as of high value in digestion,
bill it is an important agent in promot­
ing the processes of diffusion, and there­
fore of absorption. Direct ex­
periment has shown that it pro­
motes the decomposition of the
albumen in the body, acting
probably bv increasing the activity ol
the transmission of liuids from cell to
cell. Nothing can demonstrate its val­
ue better than the fact that if albumen
without salt is introduced into the in­
testines of an animal, no portion of it
is absorbed, while it all quickh- disap­
pears if salt be added. If any"" further
evidence were required it could be
found in the powerful instinct which
impels animals to obtain salt. Buf­
faloes will travel for miles to reach a
""salt lick""; and the value of salt in im­
proving the nutrition and the aspect ol
horses and cattle is well known to
eveiy farmer.
Tlie conclusion, therefore, is obvious
that salt, being wholesome, and, in­
deed, necessary, should bo taken in
moderate quantities, and that absten­
tion from it is likely to bo injurious.

Xerer Doze.

The London Lancet discusses the subject of
rising at the end of sleep. Dozing, it de­
clares, is not admißsable from any reasona­
ble or healthful point of view. The brain is
first to fall asleep, and is followed by the ac­
tive organs, and it is only perfect and natu­
ral when shared by all the several parts of the
organism. All the parts of the system are
not equally exhausted, and those least fa­
tigued soonest wake, while those most ex­
hausted are aroused with the greatest diffi­
culty. The several parts of the organism
should need rest at the same time. To bring
this about a person should ""wake early and
feel ready to rise; this fair and equal start of
the sleepers should be secured, and a wise
self-manager should not allow a drowsy feel­
ing of the consciousness, or weary senses, or
an exhausted system to beguile him into the
folly of going to sleep again when once his
consciousness has been aroused."" The
writer declares that a man who will not allow
himself to doze, will, in a few days, find him­
self almost unconsciously ""an early riser.""

they were, and all about them? Vesuvius
may have erupted 2,000 years before Pom­

she did for Pompeii.
Pompeii had been forgotten for ages. A

to secure It, he grasped the precious bags,
and turned to fly. At the very door the

the body was found, the bony fingers clasp­

At first the watch was about the size of a des­
sert plate. It had weights, aud was used as a
“pocket clock.” The earliest known use of the
modern name occurs in the record of 1552, which
mentions that Edward VI had “one larum or
watch of iron, the case being likewise of iron
gilt, with two plummets of lead.” The first
■watch may readily be supposed to be of rude ex­
ecution. The first great improvement was in
1500. The earliest springs were not coiled, but
only straight pieces of steel. Early watches had
only one liana, and, being wound up twice a day,
they could not be expected to keep the time of
day exactly. The dials were of silver and brass;
the cases had no crystals, but opened at tho back
and front, and were four or inches iB diame­
ter. A plain wateh cost more than $1,500, and
after one was ordered it took a year to make it.

LET NONE MISUNDERSTAND THE ISSUE
of the great conflict that is upon us.* It
involves a sweeping political revolution—
not merely the transfer of power from
one political party to another, but the
revolutionary overthrow of the worst
methwis and purposes of both parties and
the triumph of the best inspirations of
every political faith. It is not simply
whether there shall be a Republican or a
Democratic President,nor is it a struggle to
make James G. Blaine or Grover Cleveland
the Chief Magistrate of the republic. A
revolution *has dawned upon both
parties and it has been born of supreme
necessity. Its seeds have been lavishly­
strewn by the Republican abuses anil
Democratic follies of the past half genera­
tion, and they have been watered and
nourished and grown to apparent harvest
time by the distinctly opposite men and
measures declared by the two Chicago
conventions of ISB4.
Cleveland will lose many Democratic
votes for the single offense of typifying
practical, honest administration. The
blatant demagogues who bang on the
edges of every hopeful party by turn will
decry him and the leprous jobbers of all
parties will make common and exhaustive
battle against him. But more than one
hundred thousand men of sincere Repub­
lican faith in the debatable States will
openly espouse his cause and press the
result to successful revolution. New York
will be desperately contested, but the
more desperately it shall be fought the
more signal will be the Cleveland victory.
Connecticut and New Hampshire promise
to be Cleveland States, and Massachusetts
will tremble in the balance between the
Plumed Knight and the man who is known
only as a resolutely honest public ser­
vant.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015137/1884-07-14/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,gu_ace_ver02,"","","",true,ca,Savannah morning news.,"",Savannah,"","",16767,21732,2178,4578,1,22416,28848,0,gu_ace_ver02/data/sn82015137/00383342120/1884071401/0201.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savannah%2C_Georgia,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/gu_ace_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn82015137%2F00383342120%2F1884071401%2F0201.jp2/pct:74.799251,75.332779,9.716274,15.869384/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/gu_ace_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn82015137%2F00383342120%2F1884071401%2F0201.jp2/pct:74.799251,75.332779,9.716274,15.869384/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

SACREDNESS OF THE BALLOT.
This survey of our condition as a Nation re­
minds us that material prosperity is but a mock­
ery if it does not tend to preserve the liberty of
the people. A free ballot is the safeguard of
republican institutions, without which no
national welfare is assured. A popular election,
honestly conducted, embodies the very majesty
of true government. Ten millions of voters de­
sire to take part in the pending contest. The
safety of the republic rests upon the integrity
of the ballot—upon the security of suffrage to
the citizen. To deposit a fraudulent vote is no
worse a crime against constitutional liberty
than to obstruct the deposit of an honest vote.
He who corrupts suffrage strikes at the very root
of free goverement. He is the arch-enemy of
the republic. He forgets that in trampling upon
the rights of others he fatally imperils his own
rights. “It is a good land which the Lord our
God doth give us,” but we can maintain our
heritage only by guarding with vigilance the
source of popular power.
I am, with great respect, .: •

needle manufactory at Reddetch, and
represints the Trajan column in min­

A pele thirty feet long and four or
five inches in diatnater was laid down
with one-half its length secured on the
shore, the other half being over the
water. At the water end of the pole
a large box was susnendt’d with a
greased pig in it. Seven men tried
for half an hour to get at the pig by
walking the greased pole. They
would take a step or two and then
tumble head over heels into the water.
The crowd roared with laughter. Fi­
nally one of the men walked about
half the distance out and made a
jump, so that he was able to catch
hold of the string on the box, which
opened the trapdoor at the bottom
and let the pig into the water. Then
he had to jump into the water himself,
catch the pig and bring it ashore.
As the pig was greased, this was no
easy task; but Uie fellow finally suc­
ceeded, and walked oil' with the aui­
n al, which let everybody know it was
alive by shrieking all it could.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn98062948/1884-08-14/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,sdhi_imbe_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Hand County press.,Henry Miller,"Miller, Dakota [S.D.]","","",11131,2145,6723,30317,3,23572,34592,0,sdhi_imbe_ver01/data/sn98062948/00340581064/1884081401/0594.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miller%2C_South_Dakota,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/sdhi_imbe_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn98062948%2F00340581064%2F1884081401%2F0594.jp2/pct:47.221279,6.200856,28.521127,87.641651/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/sdhi_imbe_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn98062948%2F00340581064%2F1884081401%2F0594.jp2/pct:47.221279,6.200856,28.521127,87.641651/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

sensible man, no man whose affection is
worth retaining, is driven away by being
told by the lady of his choice that she
likes him, that she feels that in time she
may come to love him, but tbat her heart
is not yet his. If be really loves her he
will come back again, and it is pretty
certain that he will learn before a second
asking whether his affection is returned
or not. But a girl, if she cannot always
choose, can always refuse ; and generally
her difficulty is this?it is evident that
this man is making love to me, I do not
love him, but I think I might do so if I
choose; shall I choose or shall I forbear ?
It is here that the power of choice come
and it is here that the voice of pru?
dence must be &eardyif~tt is to rnr-bewd
at all. . In such circumstances a trirl will
act wisely' if she' /gives roqwder^bie
weight to the general opinion''tfifift-'J'is
held of the gentleman in question by his
professional brethren or bis business ac?
quaintances. It is, in short, not the man
who is agreeable among women, but he
who is well liked by his own sex, whx/is
the man to choose for a husband. There
are certain persons, however, of the op?
posite sex who are almost as good judges
of a man's disposition as those of his
own, and tbey are his sisters. A girl
can always tell how a man stands with
hia sisters: if they are really fond of
him, she may be almost sure that he will
make a good husband.. A mother, of
course always speaks well of .her son; it
is not what she says of him, but his
behavior to her, that is to be looked to.
And a lady may feel certain on this
point, that as a man nyw treats, his moth?
er and sister, so he will treat her six
months after marriage. All. this may
seem very cold-blooded, very far removed
from the tender feeling which courtship
induces. But, after ally a girl has a
choice to make?a choice upon which
the happiness of her whole, life will de?
pend ; and there is always a time wheth?
er she notices it or not, before she parts
with'the control of her heart, at which
she ought to listen to her judgment
Without better evidence than her own
feelings she is very likely to. make a
mistake ; but if she can .assure herself
tbat her lover is a man who is respected
and liked by bis male friends, and is a
favorite at home, she may be pretty sure
tbat in listening to bis love she is choos

A Parisian once remarked to Longfellow
that there was one American word that he
never could understand or find in any dic­
tionary. “What is it?” inquired the poet.
“Thateldo,” was the reply. “I never heard
of the word,” said Longfellow. Presently a
servant came in to replenish the tire. After
putting on a little fuel, Longfellow remarked
to him, “That will do.” “Ila!” exclaimed the
Frenchman, “that is the very word which
has troubled me.”

THE CONFEDERATE BATTLE
FLAG.
How the Stars and Crossbars Came to
be Adopted.
1 saw Gen. Joe Johnston on the street
to-day, says a Washington letter. He is
as straight as an arrow, and the only
sign of age is seen in his silky gray hair,
which flows in silvery curls almost to
his shoulders, and in his full gray beard.
Otherwise he might pass for a young
man. His dignified step is firm, his eyes
bright and his health apparently perfect.
He is now 77 years of age, but he does
not look over 60. He lives on Connecti­
cut avenue, one of the swell streets of
the capital, and is, I suppose, in com­
fortable circumstances. I called upon
him to ask him about the origin of the
Confederate battle flag now over a year
ago. He told me then that it was
only partially his design. Said he: “At
the battte of Manassas—you Northern­
ers call it Bull Run—the Stars and Bars
proved a failure because they were so
much like the Union colors. Indeed, both
armies mistook their enemies lor Iriends,
and vice versa. After the battle I re­
solved to discard this flag and called for
each regiment to procure its State colors.
This they were not able to do, aud I asked
the army for new designs. Among those
presented, one by Geu. Beauregard was
chosen, and I altered this only in making
it square instead of oblong. This flag
was afterward adopted by the Confeder­
ate armies generally. It was a Greek
cross ot blue on a red field, with white
stars on the blue bars.” This flag was
designed by a Col. Walton, of Louisiana,
and by him presented to Gen. Beauregard.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015137/1884-10-27/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,gu_ace_ver02,"","","",true,ca,Savannah morning news.,"",Savannah,"","",10309,18269,2239,4758,1,22707,29475,0,gu_ace_ver02/data/sn82015137/00383342120/1884102701/0684.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savannah%2C_Georgia,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/gu_ace_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn82015137%2F00383342120%2F1884102701%2F0684.jp2/pct:45.400097,61.981340,9.860395,16.142494/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/gu_ace_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn82015137%2F00383342120%2F1884102701%2F0684.jp2/pct:45.400097,61.981340,9.860395,16.142494/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Gildersleeve, of New York, as he took
his seat at the breakfast-table, remarked
that the day promised to be a fair one.
""I am going to the polls,"" he said, ""and
as I am 85 years old, it is not unlikely
that I shall cast my last vote."" Having
finished his breakfast the veteran pro­
ceeded to the election district where he
was registered. A friendly policeman

Like a soft carpet of the rhoestgreen;
Still leaps the fountain with ite light pulsation,
Brightening the scene.
Years have not changed it; now as then the river
* Winds in the distahee like a silver stream;
Through the old orchard still the sunbeams
quiver
And brightly gleam.
Ah ! but no voice of sweetest modulation
Nor rippling laughter greets my listening ear;
All the bright scene but breathes in desolation,
“ She is not here !”
Not bore! not here!” the murmuring elm trees
sigh it, . ' * k
Tiro rustling grass repeats it ’neath my feet,
Her cherished roses mournfully reply it

O’er the soft lawn the shadows westward creep­

To wake no more! .","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033295/1885-01-28/ed-1/seq-6,"","",6,"","",1,whi_dorothy_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Watertown republican.,J.W.

Fargo, D. T.. Feb. s.—An Argus special from
Standing Rock Indian agency states that by the
recent death of -Young Antelope, Stanley Hunt­
ley, a newspaper man who at one time was con­
nected with the Dakota press, and now in New
York, becomes chief of the Teton nation.
Tho manner in which Huntley becomes
■chief of all the Sioux tribes is like a fable.
Years ago, before Sitting Bull surrendered,
Huntley was sent by a Chicago paper to north­
ern Montana, to interview the warrior, who,-
tired of scouring the plains, crossed the border
and became the guest of Major Walsh, at Wood
mountain, in the British northwestern territory.
Here, camped around the Major's post, were
the old man and his braves, among
whom were Little Knife, hereditary chieftain of
the Tetons, who was too old for war and the
buffalo trail. Little Knife injured one of his legs
while dismounting from a pony, tho medicine
men failed to give any relief, and tho old chief
was given up to die. Huntley ap­
peared on tho scene, and with a
newspaper man’s extensive knowledge,
bound the wound with leaves and oil, and he
recovered. Huntley was adopted, and last fall,
when Sitting Bull and his troune went
East, an ndopted sister of Huntley’s was
with them and recognized Huntley. Lit­
tle Knife had two sons, Mountain Bull
and Young Antelope. The former
was killed some time ago, and now ,by Antelope’s
death. Huntley becomes chief, as a male rela­
tive by adoption is as strong as through blood
among the Indians. Huntley’s Indian name is
Waukpaywaukan, or Holy Loaf. Huntley is
the author of the Well known ’’Spoopendyke”
papers.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015679/1885-02-06/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,in_asimov_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Indianapolis journal.,Douglass & Conner,Indianapolis [Ind.],"","",14650,20277,4276,8202,2,28885,39341,0,in_asimov_ver02/data/sn82015679/00414210089/1885020601/0312.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indianapolis,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/in_asimov_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn82015679%2F00414210089%2F1885020601%2F0312.jp2/pct:50.718366,51.541649,14.803531,20.848479/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/in_asimov_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn82015679%2F00414210089%2F1885020601%2F0312.jp2/pct:50.718366,51.541649,14.803531,20.848479/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

after dinner, with H few congenial
friends anywhere, he was ready, inter­

when Genoa! Grant xvas President. It
xvas at a dinner-party he gave at the
White House. Among the guests were
a number of Senators and General
Sheridan. Mrs. Grant and the ladies
had retired from the! table ami xxe were
smoking our cigars. General Grant
talked a grent deal. He was in his

tinally we began to
talk of the time of life a man would
most care to live over again. F.aeh
one mentioned some particular age
when life seemed brightest und most
desirable, and a period he would enjoy
to live the second t me. Some turned
back to bovhood, others to early man­
hood, xxitli the plciisantest recollec­
tions, while to some the present was
most .satisfactory. 'And you. General;
w hat part of your life would you like
to live over again ?"" one of the gin sts
asked of tho President.
' General Grant dropped his chin on

it in his face, xvhii h, as usual, xv s a

xvoiihl choose tha' par; of his lite which
had been prosperous anil great. He
lifted his lead and said in a voice of

of real adversity to begin with. I think

To the Ftiitor of The kvknixo Star:
Smithsonian institction,
Washington d. C., June 15, 1885.
I aish to call tin attention of your readers to
the beneficial ette? t of boiling, in increasing the
potability of water, a fact which does not ap1-ar
to be generally appreciated or-understood.
Hail this practice prevailed on the first outbreak
of the typhoid disease at Plymouth, Pa,,
it is very probable that the number of eases of
illness and of deaths might have been very
greatly diminished. In cholera seasons this
treatment is especially important, as water is
largely the medium of introduction of the injur;
>t;s influences into the system.
1> irimr the Cemennial Exhibition I was stationed
in West Philadelphia, near the Centennial
buildlnvs for six months, and although
cases of diarrhoea were prevalent all around
toe, the use of Itoded water appear d to be an
ahsoiute preventive. We had several cases of
lllnefesof this class*>efore we begun to use this
itry - precaution, but none afterwards.
Ti?e fishy taste of the Potomac water at the
present time, due 10 the solution in it of decomposed
vegetation, or ot tresh-wau-r sr>onses ean
also be in great measure removed by tile same
process.
I iave usually enough water boiled in the
morning to last through the day. This is placed
in a large water-cooler, without ice. and drawn
trom when required to fill ice pitchers, Ac. The
water should boll actively for half an hour in
order to kill the germs of disease. Of course
hi 1^ i5i only effective in of organic imimrJty,
hs mineral poisons would not be destroved
thereby. sfkncek f. kaird.

THE BECENT CYCLONE
Jf^
The Ruin in Iowa.
Sibley, Iowa, Special Telegram, June 16
The tornado of Sunday night entered th
state at 9 p. m. at Onawa, Monona county,
tra-v elingfrom southwest to northeast at the
rate of about fifty miles an hour. It reached
f-ioux City at 10:15 and Le Mars at 1045.
This storm lasted about thirty minutes and
was accompanied by rain and hail. It ther
veered to the east and we have heard ol
damage being done as far east as Waterloo.
Until 12.15 a. m. it rained when anoihei
tornado from the northwest swept ovei
Le Mars more destructive than the first
lasting an hour and a half. This came
from Southern Dakota as far west as
Yankton. The track, as far as can be learned
at this time, was in the shape of a letter Y,
with the base of the letter pointing east, the
junction being in Cherokee county, -where
the largest amount of damage was done.
From Onawa by way of Sioux City to Chero­
kee it is neaily eighty miles from Yankton
to Cherokee it is 120 miles, and from Chero­
kee to Fort Dodge, it is seventy-five miles.
This will gi\ an idea of the storm's course.
The duration of the storms at Le Mars, was
about an hour and a half.
THE LOSS BY COUNTIES.
The damage in Cherokee county will
amount to $200,000 inWoodbury county,
$100,000 Plymouth county, $100,000
Monona county, $50,000, and Ira county,
$50,000. At this time there are reports ol
damage in Beuna Vista, Sac, Pocahontas,
Calhoun and Webster counties, but not
enough to form an estimate as to the loss.
Beyond Fort Dodge it was in the
form of ^ind and rain, v\ing spent
its fury. The number of casualties
60 far as learned is thirteen killed,
seven fatally and fifty severely wounded.
The following damages are in addition to
those already reported: At Sioux City, the
brick paint works are in ruin. The packing
house is damaged $7,000. The Plymouth
mills at Le Mars is damaged at 10,000, and
the gas orks $5,000. Four freight cars are
on their sides. The St. Joseph German
Catholic church is damaged $10,000 the ice
aouse $2,500, Adams skating rink $1,500
The Richards house roof is gone and the
rooms flooded. The opera house is unroofed
and nearly every house is more or less dam­
aged. The main loss of life and destruction
seems to have been in Cherokee county, and
the news is slow in coming in account of the
wires being down.

SUFFERING INSURANCE COMPANIES.
Des Moines, Special Telegram, June 16.
Reports sent to-day to thediflerent insur­
ance companies of this city show that the
damage is A ery much heavier than was first
reported in Ida, Woodbury, Monona, Dela­
ware, Johnson, Sac and Lynn counties.
The loss was the heaviest in Johnson and
Delaware counties. The largest and heavi­
est buildings were torn to pieces. In and
about Sioux City the damage is approxi­
mated at $150,000. The western por­
tion of the state, as far south as Potta­
wattamie county, and the two northern
tieis of counties A\ere badly damaged, and
houses, barns, corn cribs, fences and live
stock A\ ere scattered .ill over the prairies.
Seventeen lives were lost and a laige num­
ber of persons injured. The Hawkeye and
State Insurance Companies of Des Moines,
and the Home of Sioux City are the heaviest
losers in the northern and western part ol
the state, and the Phoenix and Continental
the heaviest losers in the eastern part.
Cars Ox erturned by a Cyclone.
By the wrecking of the Chicago, Milwau
kee & St. Paul train between Sioux Falls
and Sioux Ctty six of the passengers were
injured serio,uly and tw enty-one more or
less bruised ,or disfigured. L. M. Scott, the
express messenger, was badly hurt about
the head, and at last reports was still un­
conscious. Mail Agent Williams was also
hurt internally, and is in a critical condition.
Conductor McCall saj s:
The first warning I had of any trouble
coming was the appearance of a monstrous
black cloud which seemed to envelop the
whole sky and appeared to be appall­
ingly close to the earth. It was then about
6.30 p. m., and it had been raining heavily
for some time. We had been runni'ag on
full speed from leaving Elk Point, but as the
wind ros""e we slowed up some, and when the
squall struck us our speed did not exceed
ten or twelve miles an hour. The first
ehock we experienced was a heavy jarring,
which was felt clear from stern to stem of
thetrain, causing the cars to rattle a6 though
they were mere paper toys.* Then another
and more poAverful wind struck us and in lese
than a, moment the ears were blown from
the tracks and thrown upon their sides in
the ditch, and I found myself struggling be­
tween tke seats with a heavy passenger
p-abbing me for dear life. In falling I struck
on my left face laying the cheek bone wide
and toruising my right arm. Where
we went off, the track is almost level with
the prairie. The two coaches, baggage and
mail cars and tender were thrown on their
Bides in the diteh, and the engine was forced
from the track but remained standing.
There were about sixty passengers in all,
including train hands and a few section
hands in the forward coach. All were more
or less Bruised, but the most serious cases
are Express Messenger Scott and Mail Agent
Williams, who were hurt internally. Two
ladies also received,severe scalp wounds.
We got the injured ones to the'farm bouses
bear And to McCook by team.

lish actor as ho btood in front of the Wind

stream of cm luges that lolled toward the
paik. Neatly every Victoria that passed
was occupied by one or two ladies, and in
every instanio they held their parasols in

the tip of their noses. Their hands and
arms weio in precisely tho position in
which a soldier places hit when ho pre

that the para-ol will blow out of her hiuub
if she does not hold it firmly.
""Do you sco how common the fashion
is?"" continued tho actor. ""Well that is
all the lesult of the Prince of Wales' trip

He Unformed.
There is a youug mnn in Council Bluffs, a
good-looking young fellow, who hat a sweet­
heart out In the country a Mew miles, and be
spends two evenings every week In her so­
ciety. A lew nights ago he stayed to the
usual hour, and as be passed out the front
door be discovered that it was cloudy and
dark. He did not rtlLb tho Idea ot driving
alone through tbe gloomy nigbt, and hinted
about a good deal to get an invitation lo re­
main, but it was not forthcoming. Hut tbe
young man was equal to tbe emergency. Go­
ing down the Btcps he artfully contrived to
fall gently to tbe ground. Thereupon he sat
up a tremendous groaning. The ruse worked
admirably. Tbe girl screamed, the men-folks
jumped out of bed, and carried tbe young
man tenderly Into the house. His horse was
put up and be was assisted to undress and
deposited in tbe spare chamber. He bad
hardly begun to chuckle over tbe success ol
the statagem when the girl's mother put in
an appearance armed with a mustard platter
a fool square and Un-borse drawing p wer.
This the immediately proceeded to clap on the
small ot tbe young man's back, where be had
Incautiously located the damage to his frame.
Por two murial hours that woman sat by tbe
bed, and was not satisfied till the beheld with
her own eyes a blister an iucb dtep. Tbe
voting man is now a reformed liar.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87076916/1885-08-01/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,ohi_hotel_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Springfield globe-republic.,"Kinney, Nichols & Co.","Springfield, Ohio","","",11964,15924,2416,4032,2,20404,27380,4,ohi_hotel_ver01/data/sn87076916/00237289250/1885080101/0220.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Springfield%2C_Ohio,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/ohi_hotel_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn87076916%2F00237289250%2F1885080101%2F0220.jp2/pct:58.635562,58.159240,11.840816,14.726077/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/ohi_hotel_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn87076916%2F00237289250%2F1885080101%2F0220.jp2/pct:58.635562,58.159240,11.840816,14.726077/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

In political circles here the democrats profess
to be highly pleased at the course of the repub­
licans of Ohio and Iowa in ""falling back upon
the bloody shirt"" for a political Issue. The
democrats do not believe that the masses In the
north can be stirred again by sectional appeals.
An Ohio democrat said to-day: ""If the Ohio
canvass is fought out iu accordance with .Sena­
tor Sherman's keynote it will so disgust many
members of that party that they will stay
away from the polls. Sectionalism was buried
in Gen. Grant's grave. Why, at the recent
grand army reunion ex-coul'ederates were pres­
ent by special invitation. The people of Ohio
consider the war over, and if the republicans
make their tight on old war issues we will beat
tltfiin certain."" Other democrats talk in the
same strain. They do not conceal their gratifi­
cation at what they consider a blunder on the
part of the republican leaders of Ohio and
Iowa.

attack of rheumatism. He could scarcely hobble

he had little if any hope of ever recovering. We saw
him in cur town last week, walking about as lively as
any other man, and In the finest health and spirits.
Upon our Inquiry as to what bad worked such a on­

FOR BLACKN.IILIXU THE PBIXCE.
Mr*. Magree Set at Liberty and Her Hn*>
band Held for Trial.
London, Dec, 23.?A magesterial examina­
tion oi the case oi John aud Sarah Mage*-, who
weie arrested on the 18th Instant at Kenuing­
ton on the cha ge of attempting to procure
money from the Prince ol Wales bv writing
threatening letters, was held to-dav. The let­
ters referred to ;-tated that lour men had t?een
ap|)oinl.'d to murder the Prince of Wale- lor
?500 each, aud the Magees offered to inioriu
on the intended assassins, provided they were
given ?1,000 and a free pardon. The detectives
who were detailed to work up the case met the
Magees by appointment and gave them
a pack:iKC containing five hundred lar­
thuigs. This was done to lead the
prisouers into believing by the size of the parcel
that their request was being fully complied
with, so that the defectives might get the whole
story from the Magees and see If there was any
truth in it. On Magee discovering that the
package contained farthings instead ol pound
picces, he upbraided the prince for his treach­
ery, demanded ?1,500 and threatened to shoot
the policemen who arrested him. Thecrowu
prosecutor believintr that Mm. Magee was luno­
cent ot the crime, aud that she was entirely
under the intiuence of her husband, withdrew
the charge against her and she was discharged
from custody. It was proved by a draft ol the
letters found in Magee's pocketbook that the
letters were in iiis hand-writing. He was com­
mitted lor trial.

Anything to Beat a Railroad.
In speaking of the movement of the general
•passenger agents to head off the ticket-scalper*,
tbe Daily Indicator says:
“The railroads have not adopted the rule re
pairing limited tickets to be used only tor coa-

tinuous train rides, without excellent reasons.
The roads have no desire to preveut passengers
from stopping over at places along their lines.
On the contrary, they have heretofore made it
as convenient as possible for people to do this
very thing. But how has the traveling public
shown its appreciation of the courtesy? Simply
by trying, in every possible way, to swindle
the railroads whenever they saw a chance. A
man wants to go to Buffalo—what does he do?
Buys a ticket to Chicago, and when he gets to
Buffalo sells the unused portion of his ticket to
a scalper. The railroad is doubly
cheated. First, it carries the original
swindler to Buffalo for less than it
takes a passenger who is too honest to indulge
in the luxury of cheating tho railroad; and, sec­
ond, it carries another mau from Buffalo to Chi­
cago at less than the regular rate. The posted
traveler, who cannot arrange to buy more tick­
ets than he iuteuds to use. never thinks of going
to the railroad office for the tickets he wants.
He patronizes the scalper, and helps that one to
skin the railroad. So it goes, the railroads by
an extension of courtesy have been victimized
and robbed by the traveling public. The every­
day traveler at all times ha3 his eyes open to the
chance to beat the public. And so widely has
the influence spread that even staid, honest-go­
ing peopie, who travel only occasionally, have
come to think it quite the thing to deal entirely
with scalpers, and assist in whatever swindle
may be necessary to effect a saving for them­
selves of a few dollars. We are glad that the
railroads have decided at last to protect them­
selves from the dishonesty of people who claim
to be more than respectable.”

About two years before tbe war, near a

girl, about 14, was sleeping in a ham­

A novel flower has been found on the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec, at the San Jose
hacienda, some twenty-two leagues from
the City of Tehuantepec. This floral

chameleon has tha faculty of changing its
colors during the day. In the morning
it is white; when the sun is at its zenith
it is red; and at night it is blue. This
red-white-aod blue flower grows on a
tree about the size of the guayave tree,
and another peculiarity of this flower it
that only at noon does it give out any

made the demand so immense that, after eleven
months, twelve large factories are engaged in its

over 180.000 quart bottles are sold every week.
It is said by the apothecaries and wholesale deal­

From Gen. O. O. Howard’s article on I
“Stonewall Jackson’s Flank Attack at ’
ClianeellorsvUle,” in the Century for Sep­
tember, the following interesting extract
is taken:
“Somebody’s guns thundered away for
a few short minutes, and then came the
fitful rattle of musketry; and before 1
could again get into the saddle there
arose the ceaseless roar of the terrible
storm. I sent our, my chief of staff. Col.
Armussen, who was’ the first officer to
mount. ‘The firing is in front of Devens;
go land see if all Is in order on the :
extreme right.’ He instantly turned
and galloped away. I mounted and set
oil' for a prominent place in rear of
Schurz’s line, who was to change front to
the northwest of every brigade southeast
of the point of attack if the attack ex­
tended beyond Devens’ right flank; for fit
w-as divined at once that the enemy was
now west of him. I could see numbers of
our men—not the few stragglers that al­
ways fly like the chaff at tiie first breeze,
but scores of them—rushing into tbe open­
ing, some with arms and some without,
runniug or falling before they got behind
the covers of Devens' reserves, and before
Gen. Schurz’s walling masses could de­
ploy or charge. The noise and the smoke
filled the air with excitement, and to add
to it Dieckmann’s gttn*| and caissons,
with batterymen scattered, rolled and
tumbled like runaway wagons and carts
in a thronged city. The guns and the
masses ot the right brigade struck the
second lines of Devens before SlcLean’s
front had given way and, quicker than it
could be told, with all the fury of the
wildest hail storm,everything, every sort
of organization that lay'in the path of the
mad current of panic-stricken men had
to give way and be broken into fragments.
My own horse seemed to catch the fury,
lie sprang, he rose high on his hind legs
anti fell over, throwing me to the ground.
My aide-de-camp, Dessauer, was struck
by a shot and killed, and for a few mo­
ments 1 was as helpless as any of the
men woo were speeding without arms to
the rear. But faithful order­
lies helped me to remount. I rode quick­
ly to the reserve batteries. A staff officer
of Gen. Hooker, Lieut. Col. Dickinson,
joined me there. Mv own staff gathered
around me. I was eager to fill the
trenches which Barlow would have held.
Buscbbtck’s second line was ordered to
change front there. His men kept their
ranks, but at first they appeared slow.
•Will they never get there?’ Dickinson
said. ‘Oh. General, see those men coming
from that hill, way ofl to the right, and
there’s the enemy after them. Fire, oh,
fire at them, you may stop the flight.’
‘No, Colonel,’ 1 said, ‘1 will never lire on
my own men.’”

Gush.
Don't gush. Avoid extremes, superlatives
and?gusli. Don't exaggerate the
significance of trifles; don't describe
moltt-hills as mountains. If a raindrop
wets your face, don't say that
the storm was terrible; if a person is
polite to you, or does you a favor, don't
immcdiutclv conclude that he adores

: you and would die for you; if, on the
j other hand, ho seems somewhat uneffu;
sive, don't infer that he hates and would
' lik? to kill you. Appreciate all good
| things, but don't sentimentalize over
them. Don't run when walking would
be just as well, and probably better; and
| don't just pour yourself out when, perj
haps, it would be better to contain yourIself.
Gush is doubtless enjoyed by an
individual here aud there who is himself
effusive, but by the world in general it
I U usually received as one of the things
I to be endured with other afflictions.?

Oil Your Boots and Shoes—The efficacy of oil­
ing depends much upon tbe way in which it is
done.* In the evening brush tbe shoe clean, and
then wash it with lukewarm water, rather to rnois
Ben than to clean it. Set it where it will dry
slowly. It should not be perfectly dry the next
morning, wheD the oil is applied, but feel damp,
not wet, however. Tbe best mixture for oiling
shoes is made of one half of neat’s foot oil—be
sure you got the genuine article—one-third beef
tallow, and one-sixth castor oil. Mix thoroughly
over a gentle boat. Depend upon the rubbiDg
rather than the heat to get the oil in—to express
it differently, two parts of rubbiDg to one of beat.
If the shoes are pegged, as farmers’ shoes usually
are and always should be, get the oil in well be­
tween the uppers and the sole ; it will prevent the
sole pulling loose, or the leather breaking away
from the pegs. Shoes worn at farm work should
be oiled at least once a week. It requires only a
few minutes to do the work, and it is decidedly
profitable labor.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016368/1886-10-30/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,mdu_indianhead_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Baltimore County union.,H.C.

ANOTHER CONFERENCE LAST NIOIIT.
An Inquiry from the friends of Mr. Kandall as
to whether they could count on the sup­
port of their tariff and revenue bill by
the Morrison democrats was discussed
at some length at a conference of the last-named
faction, held last night. It was finally decided
that an answer should be made, to the effect that
the tariff-reform democrats were so anxious to
redeem their pledges to the people made at
the Chicago convention, that they would sup­
port any measure looking to the reform of the
tariff laws which seemed to be reasonable In its
terms. It was not deemed advisable to make the
reply more specific at this time.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1887-02-02/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,dlc_rottweiler_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Evening star.,W.D.

SHE WAS X0T AN ELOPER.
IIow a Pretty Married Woman of Logansport
ProYed Herself Innocent of Suspicion.
A Logansport lady, en route home from Jeffer­
ville, had a somewhat trying and rather ludicrous
experience in this city, a few days ago. She is
married and thirty-two years old, but her beauty
is of the fresh type (that gives her the
appearance of being ten years, jounger. The
story of her experience is well told
by the Logansport Journnal, which says,
""Although the ubiquitous drummer attempted
to get one glance from her, and the brakeman
on the train attempted to get into her good
graces by asking her if he'couldn't do something
to contribute to her ease and pleasure, she
heeded them rot, and religiously obeyed the in­
junction to ""speak to no one but the conductor.""
All went well until the train arrived at Indian­
apolis. As soon as it came to a stop there three
policemen boarded tho train and walked through
the cars, eyeing all the female passengers close­
ly. They eyed the lady bound for Logansport
more closely than anyone else. They walked
through the car again, and then again, and then
they consulted, and two of the policemen took a
seat in front of the fair woman and one of them
behind her. At last one of them looked her
squarely in the face and inquired her name, her
residence, ber age, her destination and a
hundred other questions that police and news­
paper reporters alone can think of. These in­
quiries were all answered truthfully. Then the
police held another consultation, and although
the conductor hollered ""all aboard,"" at the de­
mand of the officers he held the train for fifteen
minutes. At last one of the blue coats ap­
proached the lady, and in a voice saturated with
beer and authority, demanded:
' "" 'Aim' your name Mary Allen? .
No, sir, it's not'
"" 'Didn't you elope this morning with a young
man from Louisville?'
"" 'No, sir.""
"" 'Well, we are looking for this girl. She is
eighteen and described as very pretty, and you
answer the description exactly.'
""The lady smiled one of her sweetest smiles,
and, after thanking the officer for the charming
compliment that had been paid her, went down
into her carpet-sack and fished out a handful
of credentials that proved beyond the shadow of
a doubt that she was not on an eloping expedi­
tion. She showed him letters addressed to 'Mrs.
So-and-so,' a photograph of her husband, a pair
of yarn socks that wanted 'darning,' and las
but not least, a pair of pantaloons with two por
holes in the seat, and a marble, two skate keys
and a Snnday-school lesson-leaf in one pocket.
These she said belonged to her twelve-year-old
boy, and she had taken them with her expecting
to find time to mend them while she visited her
brother's folks. She offered to eo deeper into the
recesses of her grip and bring additional
evidences of her identity to the surface,
but the officers called a halt. They were
satisfied. There was no sign of"" 'love's
young dream' in that erip. Down ""deeper there
might be cold mince pie, but there were certainly
no orauge blossoms. They apologized and
smiled, and the lady accepted the apology and
blushed and smiled, and the conductor smiled.
and as soon as the passengers learned the facts
they smiled, and the engine whooped and the
cars fairly shook their sides. It was a-joke, and
the pretty lady bound for Logansport was the
bright particular star on that train.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015679/1887-02-08/ed-1/seq-8,"","",8,"","",1,in_indianapolisolympians_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Indianapolis journal.,Douglass & Conner,Indianapolis [Ind.],"","",9420,4684,4012,14308,8,27400,37804,4,in_indianapolisolympians_ver02/data/sn82015679/00271745680/1887020801/0392.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indianapolis,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/in_indianapolisolympians_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn82015679%2F00271745680%2F1887020801%2F0392.jp2/pct:34.379562,12.390223,14.642336,37.847847/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/in_indianapolisolympians_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn82015679%2F00271745680%2F1887020801%2F0392.jp2/pct:34.379562,12.390223,14.642336,37.847847/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

HOW THS MALAKOFF WAS TAKEN.

Diplomatic Spying The Story of
a JOis-
f patch That Brought 613,000.
Diplomatic espionage rendered a great ser­
vice to tho Second Eiudu-o in 18.)5 byen-
! abling t he French to get into Sebastopol. Tho
credit for tho fall of that stronghold was
duo, it has just transpired, to the lato SI. de
lloustier, who was in tho year above men­
tioned at the head of the French embassy at
- Berlin. At that time CoL von Munster was
military attache of Prussia at St. Petersburg,
and in high favor at court Tho wife of the
' Czar Nicholas was a princess of Prussia,, and
i was fondly attached to her native laud. All
I the representatives of her brother were tre.it
ed by her with a kindness verging on famil-
iarity. The councils of war, when the siege
of Sebastopol wa3 going on, used to bo held
in her sitting room. CoL von Munster was
i given tho minutes of them. No detail of the
campaign which the military authorities at
St. Petersburg could givo him was' withheld.
: He sent confidential reports of thoinforma­
' tiou so obtained to Berlin for the king's solo
perusal.
j Frederick William kept them a secret from
1 every one but Gerlach a kind of seer belong­
; iivgtothe feudal party, who regarded Man­
teuffel as an apostato because he advised the
; king to keep on good terms with Napoleon
: III., and who discovered"", when Queen Vic-
toria went on a visit to St. Cloud, that she
; was the scarlet lady of tho Apocalypse. Man­
; teuffel was furiously jealous of the royal
favor in which Gerlach stood, and took means
to intercept the Munster correspoudenca so
. as to read it and have it copied. Iu one of
these letters there was a dispatch from Todle­
; ben informing the czar of the weakness of tho
j Malakoff, which could not hold out against
a strong assault
How, Mauteuffel's copying clerk was in the
pay of De Moustier, aud, when they were
thinking at tho Tuileries of ordering the siege
of Sebastopol to bo raised, a copy of Todle­
ben's dispatch was sold to the French em­
bassy for 60,000 francs. Orders were seut to
Pelissicr to attack the Malakoff. He, not
wanting to be pestered by his incompetent
emperor and the gong about him with mili­
tary instructions, ordered the telegraph wires
to be cut. Marshal Vai'daut was then packed
off to the Crimea with the secret paper in his
pocket. It was a revelation to Pelissier, aud
ail that remained was to get tho English to
attack the Redan whilo the French were try­
ing to storm the Malakoff. The general won
a ducal titie, a big grant of money and a pen­
sion, and became such nn importantpei-sou-age
that tho empress gave to him the hand of
her beautiful cousin, who was presented by
her imperial majesty with a suitable dowry
and trousseau of regal magnificence. Paris

The dream troubled him, and ho went to that
spot on the bank of the river where ho had
stood in his dream, and sure enough there
was tho ripplo in tho shallow stream. Ila

leading to the home of the doomed animal.
Thou the fuse is fired, and tho result is that
all the ground hogs iu the hole aro killed by
the concussion.

""I'll tell yon a dream I had last night,
That is. It yon care to hear
About it,"" he said ""you'll think it is quite

Absurd, 'twas so very queer.1'

""Do tell me, I really am fond of dreams*
Although I have very few
A dream very often a warning see ma,""

She said ""waa it all about you?""

*'Well, hardly upon me wore bent
All eyes, but I haughtily carried
My head quite high, for I dreamt I went

Down the aisle of a church to be married.

uThe

wedding-march pealed out clear and loud
Aud flowers sweet and rare,
Low trampled by the curious crowd,

With perfome filled the air.

""There shyly walking by my side,
Ihe sweetest girl 1 knew,
Was soon to be my own dear bride

How queer, that girl was you.""

""Me?"" and her eyes so bright and clear*
She slyly veiled.from view
""I don't think it is so very queer*

LANGUAGE OP HORTICULTURE.
What droll things are to be met with*
in Gardeners' Gazettes, or in Half-hours
with Horticulture, or in Conservatory
Chronicles, or in whatever other blue­
apron and pruning-knife journal falls
under the non-teohnicaleye! Here is a
peep into one of them, just to show its
fruits of learning and flowers of speech.
In it we read of an orchard-house in full
swing of a stage in a conservatory of
melons having a collar of a primula
getting a habit of gloxinias wanting a
shift of all plants requiring to be
dressed of peaches forming elbows of
potatoes having well-ripened eyes of
icurrants having spurs of pines wanting
hot-water pipes under their beds of
specimens being starved to rest of roses
being impatient of sap being inclined to
rush away of azaleas not liking tobacco­
smoke: of figs running riot of grapes
that can stand sulphur-fumes, that are
well out of the way, that are no end of
trouble, that may not be left to them­
selves, that will not be hurried, that can
get rusty, that are grosshabited, that
dislike to be buried, that refuse to be
finished off, that rob one another, stono
themselves have warts and:can color,
and swell, and bleed, and start! Gar­
deners, also, are directed to do dreadful
deeds. They are to pinch the vines, to
stake the carnations* to strike
veronicas, to behead winter greens, to
turn out bouvardias, to reduce climbers,
put endive into cold-pits, prick out
-celery, and stick peas! The territories
in which all this is to be done are as
uninviting as possible. They are full,
so we read, of red spiders,' greenfly,
earwigs, mealy bugs, wireworms,
caterpillars, carrot grubs,onion mag­
gots, mildew, snails, ants, slugs, scale,
-club, and cats. Nor are the weapons
with which war is to be waged against
t^ese any sweeter to the imagination.

Gardeners are to arm themselves with
clay, tar, chalk, soot, lime, bran,
sulphur, sweet oil, wood ashes, gas
lime, resin, soapsuds, softsoap, nicotine
6oap, tobacco dust, tobacco paper,
guano, quassia, paraflme, hellebore
powder, fir-tree oil, brewers' grains,
and red-lead. In such perpetual battle
against garden pests—as they are
called—the only pleasant thought is
-that all seems to be greatly in favor of
""the gardener.—Chambers1Jourual.

TO TEST SEEDS.

To test seeds place 100 of them be­
""tween sheets of blotting paper laid on
.sand, and keep the paper damp in a
3lace where the temperature^ is- about
78 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. The
/number of seeds germinating will indi­
cate the percentage good. Place the
teeds on a piece of flannel in a-saucer,
with sufficient water to moisten it
thoroughly. After scattering the seeds
(100) on the flannel, put a piece of
damp blotting paper over the whole
and place in a warm room. Keep it
-continually damp, and in a short time
the seeds will germinate the number
«prouting will be the percentage of
.good seed. For examining seeds as to
purity, scatter them on apiece of black
•cardboard, and the foreign grains are
leally observed. If a good collection
of seeds, true to their kind, is kept for
comparison, the impurities can be easily
identified.

TO CLEAN CARPETS.

To one quart of warm water add five
ounces of borax, pulverized. When
•old add two ounces of aqua ammonia,
•one half-ounce of sulphuric ether, one
half-ounce of glycerine, and one half­
ounce of spirits of wine. Take two
tablespoonfuls of the mixture and put
In one quart of warm water-—or same
proportion—and with a cloth or sponge
rub the carpet briskly. It is not ne­
cessary to use the liquid very freely, but
a liberal amount of foam or suds will
""be developed, and rubbing this briskly
over the carpet appears to be the most
effective agency in cleaning and renova­
ting it. After a few square feet of the
•urface has been thoroughly rubbed
with the foam dry with a dry cloth or
•ponge. Do not use the liquid too freely
or get your carpet too wet. This ap­
plication does not injure the most deli­
cate colors, but on the contrary revives
and brightens them and restores the
dirtiest carpet to almost its original
teauty,removes grease-spots and smears
almost every kind, and is easily
applied without removing the carpet
from the floor.

FURNITURE FOLISH.

Ona and a half ounces of alcohol and
Ibe same weight of butter of antimony,
©ne-half ounce muriatio acid, eight
ounces linseed oil, and one-half pint of
vinegar. Mix thoroughly and apply a
thin, even coat. What is known as
French polish is made by puttiug half
an ounce of shellac, the same quanty of
gum lac, and one-quarter ounce of gum
fadarac Into a pint of spirit® of wine.

Put them together in a stone bottle,
shaking frequently until the gums are
all dissolved, when it is ready for use.
Boiled linseed oil rubbed on with a cloth
is a very good substitute for polish.
And here is another cheap and very
tiseful. polish and which will work wond­
ers with dingy furniture: Equal parts
of linseed oil,* turpentine, and vinegar,
well rubbed in and polished with a *eo
of chamois leather.

STOVE POLISH.

Mix lampblack with waterglass (a
solution of silicate of soda) to about the
thickness of sirup, and apply to tho
stove with a brush, giving a thin evon
coating let it stand for twenty-four
hours to dry. Then mix graphite or
black lead with gum water and
apply evenly, after which a beautiful
and durable polish may bo obtained by
rubbing briskly with a polishing brush
in the usual manner. Ordinary stove
polish mixed with turpentine and applied
in the usual way makes a blacker, more
glossy, and more durable polish than
when put on with any other liquid,
The turpentine prevents rust, and the
odor soon passes off.

POLISHING POWDER.

One ounce of Paris rouge (oxide of
iron) and six ounces of carbonate of
magnesia, thoroughly mixed. It is best
used with a small piece of soft cloth
dampened in water or alcohol and then
rubbed, until nearly dry, the article
afterwards being polished with chamois
skin. It is equally good for silver,
copper, gold, steel, iron, or tin. The
powder has a pink color and is largely
sold under different and high sounding
names. It was first suggested by the
German chemist Thomas Weigler.

TO CLEAN A PAPERED WALL.
Take a loaf of stale bread—
rye bread is the best— cut in into six
or eight pieces, and, taking a piece
begin at the top of the wall and rub
gently downward, going over the entire
wall in this way, and the paper will be
well cleaned and greatly improved. Be­
fore beginning operations use a bellows
to blow off the loose dust. If gr&ase
spots appear put blotting paper over
them, and press with a hot flatiron.
Another excellent way to clean wall­
paper is to put about two quarts of
wheat bran in a coarse flannel bag and
rub the wall with it as directed. Such
an application will make the paper look
almost like new.

HOW TO TAINT BUTTER.

A correspondent of the Rural New
Yorker says: I worked at a place where
the milk was set in pans in one corner,
piled on the flour, one above the other.
The stove was at one side of the pans,
and at the other a place was made for
old boots and shoes. One pair of rubber
boots were particularly offensive. They
were placed with the others at times,
and whenever this was done the odor
was plainly perceptible in the butjter.
This was not a pleasant experiment,
but it was remarkably forcible. There
are hundreds of kitchens where butter
is madeunder such circumstances.

A writer in the American Dairyman
gives his experience: A few weeks ago
we saw a large dairy farmer, whose
butter brings a price high above the
market, carting
out manure. The carts
went within sixty feet of the dairy, and
so they were covered with hay caps, or
canvas covers, which enabled them to
pass and make very little smell. A gen­
tleman farmer has' been furnishing a
fashionable district in this city with
really most excellent butter from his herd
of fancy. cows,the demand for the butter
was in excess of the supply and—""the
goose hung high."" Suddenly the but­
ter was a way—way off. What could
the matter beP The grass fields near
the daiiy had been manured and the
butter had taken the odor straight to
the tables of the city consumers. So
we live and learn, but experience is a
rough teacher sometimes.

HEMP AND FLAX. 1

The large amount of binder twine
used by self-binding harvesters has
raised the brice of hemp, and it is quite
likely that increased culture of both
hemp and flax will result. It is long
since Western New York grew much
flax. It is hard on land, and especially
sounder the old processes of rotting
the fibre in running streams where its
valuable manurial properties were
washed away. By newly invented
processes a large amount of fibre can be
got from the stalk and the remainder
which contains much gluten, can be
used for manure. The seed is valuable
for feeding after all its oil has been
extracted, and when fed to any kind of
stock make rich manure. Flax and
hemp both require very rich soil, but
if the oil meal from the seed is fed at
home most of the fertility required in
growing the crop may be retained on
the farm. The making of twine re-'
quires less labor than the manufacture
of finer fabrics, and it should seem that
this essential for securing our harvests
ought to be furnished at home.

KAXDOARDEN PLOW.

It will j.iy anyone having a fourth
acre of garden to have a hand plow, as
by its use three-fourths of the hoeing
can be saved. Ihave used different
kinds, and have npt been without one
for twenty-five years* but have discard­
ed all complicated arrangements of
knives, harrows and cultivator teeth,
and now use but tw^ tools on my ploW,
and.never but oiwyjft a time. These
are a small share op ..turning plow and
a little bull tongue not more than an
inch wide. I find it is easier and does
better worlt to go twice rapidly across
the garden than to try to work a wider
space aud go once laboriously through.
The secret of good work in the gap­
den is to cultivate at the right

:w,':iiilSi6'

which is ju&t as soon after a rain as the
land can be worked, and the great
value of the hand plow is that it enables
one to do the work so quickly that it
can be done at the best time. I can
break the crust on an acre of garden
with one of these implements in two
hours but it would take two or three
men a day with hoes to do it. When
^neof these implements is to be used,
everything must be planted in rows tho
length of the garden.

FOR THE FARMER.

Fowls will eat a great deal of granu­
lated charcoal. As a preventtive of dis­
ease it is invaluable.

In sowing small seeds of feeble growth
for growing plants cover by sprinkling
earth on them with a seive and then
press it down gently with the back of a
hoe or shovel.

The old time yields of 800 or 400
bushels of potatoes per acre were most­
ly grown on olover sod freshly plowed
down. Better not lose sight of so good
a practice.

Farmers who plowed their oats
ground last Fall now see their fields
covered with grain before their neigh­
bors have sown a kernel.

Plant no more corn than you can at­
tend to in the best manner, and plow
no moire ground than you can manure
well,

A geod way to teach hens the habit
of egg-eating is to throw shells about
where they can get them. The best
way to cure them of the habit is to put
them under a pot lid.

Mr. T. B. Terry enumerates among
the advantages of leaving manure to
accumulate on the floor of stables under
horses that the animals have a com­
fortable, soft place to stand on. But a
soft place is just what is bad for hoofs,
and ospecially so when there is ammonia
in it.

Hoe your fruit garden frequently. It
is easier to hoe the ground over once
in ten days than it is to hoe. it over
once in thirty days. The s'ecret of cul­
tivating is to never let a weed get be­
yond the seed leaf. A stroke in time
saves ninety nine.

A little time spent in filing or grind­
ing an edge upon the hoe will save a
good deal more in rapid and efficient
work, not to speak of making labor
lighter.

The great mistake, says Mr. Cheever
that most of us make in feeding young*
animals is in giving too much at a time
and making the time to long between the
feedings. ""A little and often11 should
be th6 rule to observe in feeding calves,
pigs and chickens.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85025431/1887-05-25/ed-1/seq-7,"","",7,"","",1,mnhi_quasar_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Mower County transcript.,Colwell Bros.,"Lansing, Minn.","","",832,1401,8068,24015,7,18231,26334,0,mnhi_quasar_ver01/data/sn85025431/00212479809/1887052501/0190.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austin%2C_Minnesota,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/mnhi_quasar_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85025431%2F00212479809%2F1887052501%2F0190.jp2/pct:4.563655,5.320118,44.254292,91.193894/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/mnhi_quasar_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85025431%2F00212479809%2F1887052501%2F0190.jp2/pct:4.563655,5.320118,44.254292,91.193894/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Better to be despised for too anxious
apprehensions, than ruined by too confi­

The greatest event in a hen's life is
made up of an egg and a cackle. But
eagles never cackle.
He that cannot forgive others breaks
the bridge over which he must pass him­

Good temper, like a sunny day,- sheds
a brightness over everything. It is

The best ant trap for those who are
troubled with this little red or black in- i
scct is a large sponge washed well and j
tressed nearly dry, leaving the cells well j
ipcned. Sprinkle over it some tine white j
sugar and place it where the ants are the

nost troublesome, nicy win soon cuicct
upon the sponge and take up their
ibodein the cells. Then it is only necessary
to dip the sponge in scalding water
which washes them out dead by the tens
)f thousands. Put on some more sugar
ind set the trap for a new haul. This
process will soon clean the house of every
int.
The Care of Linen.
One of the most important departments
n household management is the care of
he linen. It is not enough to see that
t is well washed and ironed; it must
jc first looked over,broken places mended !
md stains removed. After it has come {
Tom the hands cf the laundress it
nust be put carefully away to secure it l
Tom the moisture of the atmosphere j
which will cause it to wrinkie, or from
nsccts which may destroy it. A judicious
mixture of aioinatic leaves or shrubs
;ut up and sewn in bags or sprinkled in
he closet or drawer where the linen is
ivill keep out most insects. Rosemary,
lavender, thyme, cedar shavings, rose
eaves, powdered sassafras and cassia
nay be used separately or together for
his purpose. In all cases it will be found
:hat linen will be economised by being

jxammeu anu wnere necessary cnraunj
cpaired previous to being put into the
ivash. It is a good plan to liave table
inen numbered so that er.ch piccc may
lave its regular turn in domes'ic use. If
inen is scorched?as is frequently the
?ase in doing it up?repeated applicaions
of a mixture of vinegar, the juice
)f an onion, a little soap rasped down, a
ablespoonful of fillers' earth, a little
oda. boiled together and laid on the
icon-lied place pretty thick and allowing
t to dry on. will remove the scorch unless
lie Hbre of the texture has been in jured.
Jnen scorches more easily than cotton
foods and laundresses should bear this
n mind.

“DIDN’T KNOW IT WAS LOADED.”
The young man fell dead!
A friend had pointed a revolver at
him.
“He didn’t know it was loaded!”
We often hear it stated that a man is
not responsible for what he does not
know. The law presupposes knowledge
and therefore convicts the man who ex­
cuses crime by ignorance!
“If T bad only known” has often been
an unfortunate man’s apology for some
evil unknowingly wrought, but in the
matter of general interest—as for iu
stance that laudanum is a poison, that
naphtha is a deadly explosive, that
blood heavily charged with a winter’s ac­
cumulations of the waste of the system,
—it is one’s duty to know the fact and
the consequences thereof. Our good old
grandmothers knew for instance, that
the opening of spring was the most peril­
ous period of the year.
Why?
Because then the blood stream is slug­
gish and chilled by the cold weather, and
if not thinned a good deal and made to
flow quickly and healthfully through the
arteries and veins, it is impossible to
Lave good vigor the rest of the year.
Hence, without exception, what is now
known as Warner’s Log Cabin Sarsapar­
illa, was plentifully made and religions
ly given to every member of the family
regularly through March, April, May
and June. It is a matter of record that
this prudential, preventive and restora­
tive custom saved many a fit of sickness,
prolonged life aud happiness to a v:gor
ous old age, and did away with heavy
medical expenditures
Mrs. Maggie Kerchwal, Lexington.
Ky., used Warner’s'Log Cabin Sarsapar­
illa “for nervous sick headache of which
I had been a sufferer for years. It has
been a great benefit to me.” Capf.
Hugh Harkins, 1114S. 15th., Philadel­
phia, Pa., says “it purified my blood
end removed the blotches from my skin.”
Mrs. Aarea Smith, Topton, Berks Cos.,
Pa., says she “was entirely cured of a
skin disease of the worst kind,” by Log
Cabin Sarsaparilla. But the skin indi­
cates a very bad condition of the blood.
If you would live and be well, go to
your druggist to-day and get Warner’s
Log Cabin Sarsaparilla and take no other,
—there’s nothing like it or as good,—
and completely renovate your impaired
system with this simple, old fashioned
preparation of roots aud herbs.
Warner, who makes the famous Safe
Cure, puts it up, and that is a guarantee
of excellence all over the known world.
Take it youself and give it to the other
members of the family, including the
children. You will be astonished at its
health giving and life prolonging pow­
ers. We say this editorially with per­
fect confidence, because we have beard
good things of it everywhere, and its
name is a guarantee that it is first class
in every particular.

But the oblong form lias some special
advantages, as every farmer knows, sav­

ing and working with the cultivator.
Country iientleman, in commenting on
tho above, calls attention to the fact that
(n portions of tho country like many of
tho westenj states, where the land has
boen surveyed into squares and right
angles, it is oasy to lay out farms in sym­
metrical fields, a form which may be
adopted being represented by Fig. 1,
where the fields are twice as long as
wide, and evory one is entered from the
Central lane or farm road through a gate.
On the left of this road is a barn, orchard
and long vegetable garden cultivated with
a horse. Ou the right is a dwelling, car
riage houso and smaller fruit trees. The
six principal fields may bo brought into a
convenient rotation of corn, barley, oats
or peas, wheat and clover and timothy for
two or three years in meadow and pasture.
WO. 2 SQUAKK KIKLDS ON A ByiJAHB
LOT.
Fig. 3 represents a farm of the same
vfaape laid out with square fields, which
would obviously bo less convenient than
the one shown in Fig. 1.
When, from uneven, hHly land this
symmetrical form cannot bo adopted, the
authority quoted from suggests that tho
lan may bo modified or varied to suit cir­
eumstancos. For instance, if a hill is in
tho way of tho farm road, it may be made
to deviate and to pass around it, shaping
the direction of tho oblong fields accord­
ingly; and a dep depression in tho land
may bo avoided in a similar way, or by
turning to the right or left and securing
a moderate grade.
f'frtunnent Pasture.
Numbered with the many cxcollent
papers read at tho New York institute's
meetings this winter was ono by Mr.
Gold, of Connecticut, on ""Treatment of
Porraanent Pastures."" In this paper Mr.
Gold called attention to the important
fact that tho way in which pastures are
fod, whether closoly or otherwise, has
much to do with their permanence in
value. It is possible to feed a pasture so
closely as to dwarf the grass roots and
kill tho largo growing specios. Too light
stocking favors tho growth of coarso and
useless vegetation, choking out sweeter
and richer grasses. Dairy cows, unless
fod some grain, impoverish pasture more
than young stock or fattening animals.
Tho fields are apt to be too flush in June
and too bare in August. Rather than
theso extremes, food some grain or sowed
corn in the scant season and do not allow
pastures to run into seed in June. Past
ure is ofton benefited by a change of the
live stock kept upon it. Sheep will eat
and destroy tho white daisy and wild car­
rot. The tread of shoep has a marvelous
Influence on the physical condition of cer­
tain light lands. Horses may be profit­
ably changed around with cattle consum­
ing much rank growth that is refused by
neat stock. Young cattle may be advan­
tageously pastured in connection with
dairy cows, which have' a habit of spend­
ing their time about the entrance to the
pasture. It is well to have trees in the
more elevated parts, thus encouraging tho
animals to leave their droppings where
they are most needed.
For a real permanent pasture we must
aherish and retain the very best grasses
that are fitted to the soil, the climate and
the treatment our pastures receive. Some­
times plowing and roseeding is the only
resort. But consider other remedies first.
Cut the bushes, trees and destroy such
weeds as can be banished without plow­
ing. Drain and irrigate. Dress with bono
or ashes, and do not expect very sudden
improvement.
Flower Seeds.
A very common mistake in sowing
flower seeds, as well as other seeds, la in
covering too deep. As a general rule,
cover only to the depth of the thickness
of the seeds, or with medium sized
seeds like balsams, zinnias, etc., a
half an inch or so is none too much.
Such fine seeds as portulacos need only to
bo pressed Into the aoil with a piece of

wood, or the p,lm of tho honrl. Always
press the ean h down firmly after sowing
all flower see's, else there is danger of
their drying np before the roots can get a
firm hold of tho soil. Seeds of the hardier
annuals may Iw sown where these are to
grow, but, as a rule, it is preferable to
transplant, as the plants are generally
stronger and stand tho drought better.
During very dry weather, and when the
seedlings are first set out, they should bo
watered frequently. Provide some sup­
port for all such annuals as require it, or
the plants will become weak and straggling
and do not make tho show they other­
wise would. The weeds should bo kept
down and the ground loosened often, so

that the plants will receive tho full
benefit of the rains and dews, which they
will not if tho ground is allowed to bo­
come hard and baked.
The Currant Worm.
Tho best known remedy for tho currant
worm, which infests both currant and
gooseberry bushes, is whito hellebore.
Now white hellebore is an altogether dif­
ferent drug from bluck hellebore, so re­
member and use the former. The cheap­
est and easiest mode of application is to
mix tho hellebore in water. Place a heap­
ing tablospoonful of the powder in a dish;
add gradually a quart of boiling water,
stirring all the while to make certain that
tho hellebore is thoroughly saturated.
Turn this mixture into a pailful of cold
water, stir well and apply with a garden
syringe or ordinary watering pot. The
object is to wet every leaf; make two ap­
plications, a few days apart. While white
hellebore is poisonous there is littlo or no
danger from its use, as above directed.
The chances are that before tho fruit is
ripe enough to eat the rains will have
washed off all traces of the hellebore, and
should any remain on the clusters the
fruit will present a soiled appearance and
bo rejected in consequence.
The Graaaes.
The grasses, for convenience, may be
ranged in two general divisions. Tho
first division comprises all the true grasses
or plants with long, simple, narrow leaves
and a long sheath divided to the base
which seems to clasp the stem; or, rather,
through which the stem appears to pass.
The artificial grasses are mostly legu
minous plants with a few stems which
are cultivated and used like the grasses,
although they do not properly belong to
that family. The clovers of all the va­
rieties, the alfalfa, etc., belong to this
latter class.
In general, grasses ought to be cut not
long after the time of flowering, for al­
though there is a great deal of nourishment
in the ripe seed, it is hardly enough to
make up for the loss in the stalks and
leaves, which are most valuable before the
soluble materials, snob as starch, gum and
sugar, are gradually changed into woody
fiber.
Fertilising Corn.
The injury often done to the germ of
the seed corn comes from contact with
manure applied at planting time. De
composed stable manure or well rotted
compost will not generally do harm. Cot­
ton seed meal seems to be very hurtful to
small seeds, as we have learned at some
cost in our gardening operations. In ap
plying all concentrated manures, it is
generally best to drop a little on each side
of the seed corn as planted, not nearer
than two or three inches. We prefer al­
ways to apply, at least, some portion of
the fertilizer at the time of depositing the
seed corn, and very close at hand, so that
the young plant may be supplied at once
with nutritious and soluble food, and
pushed into vigorous growth from tho
very beginning. Southern Cultivator.

This new carina is pronounced by Peter
Henderson as being tho most distinct and
beautiful of all the recent French vari
eties. Like most of this class it is dwarf,
rarely exceeding four feet in height, but
in profusion of bloom is said to bo quite
remarkable. The flowers resemble orchids ;
tho general color is canary yellow, mottled
and streaked with crimson and scarlet.

Shall Women be Allowed to Yotef
The question of female suffrage has agi­
tated the tongues and pens of reformers ror
many years, and good arguments have been
adduced for and against it. Many of the
softer sex could vote intelligently, and many
would vote as their husbands did, and give
no thought to the merits of a political issue.
They would all vote for Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription, for they know it is a boon to
their sex. It is unequaled for the cure of
leucorrhea, abnormal discharges, morning
sickness, and tho countless ills to which
women are subject. It is the only remedy
for woman's peculiar weaknesses and ail­
ments, sold by druggists, under a positive
guarantee from the manufacturers, that it
will give satisfaction in every case, or money
will be refunded. See guarantee on wrapper

that the whole of the new embankment of
the Yollow River a^ChangCbou begun last
autumn and carried on at a coat equal to
over nine millions of dollars has been com
pletely swept away by the recent flood. 01
the 8,000 lineal feet of river wall recently
completed not one inch remair.a and the
waters are pouring through the immense
gap into Honan, unchecked. From 800 to
1,000 laborers who were on the bank were
swept away and drowned.
A disastrous flood in the province of
Moukden, about 350 miles northeast of Pe­
kin, caused tbe death of hundreds of the
catlves, tbe utter annihilation of very maDy
homes, destruction to crops and prospects of
a general famine for the coming winter.

An interesting feature ot the Paris
Exhibition of next year will be a
group of 49 structures intended to
give a history of the human dwelling.
The different types of dwellings rep
resented will include those of the pre­
historic period—under rocks, in caves,
on water, and on land; and in later
times those of early historic civiliza­
tion, of Aryan civilization, of Roman
civilization in the East and in tho
West, and of rude civilizations discon­
nected from the general process of hu­
manity—such as the Chinese, Eskimo,
Japanese, African, Aztec, etc. The
int<riors and surroundings will be
those of tlie different epochs studied,
and it is intended to people the dwell­
ings with figures in representative
costumes.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86091172/1888-10-19/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,idhi_cather_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Wood River times.,T.E.

SCRAPS OF SCHOOL GOSSIP.
IOWA has ten women county school superr
intendents.

CousELt, UNIVERSITT has a freshman
class numbering four hundred, and claims
that this breaks the record.

EIOHT millions of children were in aver­
age daily attendance in the public schools of
tbo South during tho past year.

THE University of Southern California
wonts a telescope with a forty-inch lens so
as to outdo the great instrument at the
Lick observatory. Mr. Alvan Clark, of
Cumbridge, saya that the cost of such a
lens would be between 8400,000 and 5500,000.

FAAXCB leads in the matter of affording
opportunities for the higher education of
women. The school of letters was tho first
department of tho University of France to
admit them. Now the Paris Medical School
and the Law School are both open to women
students.

PCXDITA RAMABAI, tho high-caste Hindoo
woman who has been soliciting funds in
this country for the establishment cf a
school in India for widows, has returned to
her native country with (50,000. She ob­
tained more money in San Francisco than
anywhere else.
""THERE is an admirable sentiment fast
gathering in the West,"" tho Boston Journal
observes, ""against the continuaoce of the
custom now in vogue in some of the larger
cities of devoting a considerable portion of
the time in public schools to a study of for­
eign languages.""

DFRIXO tho year (89,000 was expended by
the New ""West Commission the erection
of buildings and in the support of thirty
schools and four academies in Utah and
New Mexico, and 2,725 pupils, 1,500 of them
of Mormon parentago and connections,
were taught by sixty-four teachers.

IN 1869 there wore in Moscow but 5 com­
mon schools, with an attendance of only
250. Tun years later the schools had multi­
plied to SO and the pupils to more than 4,000.
Sinco then tho numbers have doubled. In
St. Petersburg there wore in 1876 only 13
common schools, with 800 pupils. These
numbers have since multiplied more than
fifteen fold.

WITH tho reappearance of the sealskin

""On, you have come first at last you

greeting a schoolmaster gave to the first
boy at school.
""WHAT are you doing with my microscope,
George?""' ""I've been shaving, father and
I.want to see if there are any hairs in the
lather as yet.""
""How DID you contrive to cultivate such
a beautiful black eye?"" asked Brown.
••Oh,"" replied White, who had been prac­
ticing upon a bicycle, ""I raised it from a

London, Nov. 20.?The Paruell commission
j resumed its sittings to-day. Attorney-General
! Webster, counsel for the Times, complained of
' the difficulty experienced in bringing forward
I witnesses from County Kerry. He called the
judge's attention to an article in the Kerry
! Sentinel (Mr. Edward Harrington's paper;,
which stated that ""the judges compiling the
: Parncll commission were showiug signs of
measles now. although at the opening of the
inquiry they had appeared to be spotless. The
judges were creatures of the conspiracy entered
into by the government and the Times, and
I were manifestly unable to veil their preju­
dices."" The attorney-general appealed to the
I court to tukc action in the matter, as such pub­
lications tended to defeat justice and amounted
' to the grossest contempt.
Mr. Beid. in behalf of Mr. Harrington, com­
plained that no notice of a charge of this char*
acter had been given them and it wa* absolutely
impossible to make au answer at present. He
asked that the matter be adjourned until to­
morrow. Presiding Judge llaunen and the
attorney-geuur.il both agreed to this aud the
i mutter stood over.
The examination of witnesses was then re­
sumed. Farmer Culloty. of Castle Island,
County Kerry, testified that because he had
served notices on tenants in 1482, two men
visited him aud one of them struck him with a
spade and the other shot him in the leg. The
leg had to be amputated. He was afterward
boycotted.
On cross-examination he said the quarters of
the nearest branch of the league wa* six miles
I distant from his lurm. He considered that the
J rents throughout Kerry were too high. He
denied that the two men who attacked him
were relatives of a servant girl whom he had
wronged.

Bengal army in 1704. A battalion of Se­
poys had seized and Imprisoned Its
English officers and vowed that It would
seivo no more. A strong hand arrested

the mutiny at Its beginning. Twenty-four
Sepoys wcro Jtrled by a drum-head court­
tuurtlal, found guilty nnd sentenced to
bo blown away from tho cannon.
On tho day of tlio oxccutlon tho troops
wcro drawn up, iingnsu anu Sepoys, 1110
guns were loaded, nnd tho prisoners led
forth to suffer tho terrlblo penalty.
Tho word of command was given for
tho first four crlmlnnls to bo tied up to
tho inuzzlos of tho guns. As tho men
wcro being bound four tall,stately grona­
dlois stepped forward from among tho
condemned ScYoys, saluted tho comman­
der, Major Hector Munro, chief of tho
Bengal army, and nshed that as thoy had
always held tho post of honor in llfo
thoy might bo given tho procedonco in
death, as it was their due. Tho request
was granted. Tho grenadiers Vtoro tied
to tho guns aud blown to pieces.
A murincr ran through tho Sepoy
battalions.who greatly outnumbered tho
English troops, nnd it seemed a If they
wcro about to rescue tholr companions,
the twentv condomed men.
Tho olliccrs of tho native regiments
approached Jlunroo nnd told htm that
their men wcro not to bo trusted, as they
had determined not to permit tho execu­
tion to proeced. Tlio chief know that
on tho Issue of that parade for oxccutlon
depended tho fate of the Bengal army.
Tho English troop t were fow.aml there
was scarcely n man among them not
moved to tears by tho. fearful death of
tho four grenadiers. But tho comman­
der knew thoy could bo trusted to dofond
tho guns, whlch.turned upon tho Sepoys,
would defeat any attempt to roscuo tholr
comrades.
Major Munro closed the EngliBh on In
tho battery the grenadiers on one side,
tho marines on the other and loadod
tho pieces with grape. Then ho sent tho
Sepoy officers back-to their battllion and
gavo tho native regiments tho word of
command, ""Ground armsl""
They know it would be madness to dis­
obey in prcsenco of tho loaded guns and
laid down their arms.
""Right about face! Forward march!1'
was the next command.
The Sepoys marched a distance from
their grounded arms and the English
soldiers with guns took ground on tho
intervening Bpaco.
Tho danger had passed away. Tho
native troops were at Munro's mercy and
the execution went on to its dreadful
close. Tho sacriflco of a fow lives saved
thousands.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82000195/1888-12-18/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,dlc_harry_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Evening post.,Washington Post Co.,"Washington, D.C.","","",4144,1620,2556,9120,2,20152,26880,4,dlc_harry_ver01/data/sn82000195/00100492866/1888121801/0197.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Washington%2C_D.C.,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_harry_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82000195%2F00100492866%2F1888121801%2F0197.jp2/pct:20.563716,6.026786,12.683605,33.928571/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_harry_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82000195%2F00100492866%2F1888121801%2F0197.jp2/pct:20.563716,6.026786,12.683605,33.928571/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

The following, from an unknown source,
contains advice which experienced business
men indorse and young men will do well to
follow:
Have but one business, know it thorough­
ly, and attend personally to its minutest
details. Be self-reliant, concentrate your
energies in a determination and supreme
effort to conquer success. Keep your own
counsel, attend strictly to business, and
never dabble in anything foreign to it. cur­
tail your expenses, never sacrifice safety to
prospective large returns, cut short your
losses and let your profits run on, and make
your prime movers industry, economy, and
fair dealing. It is the merest rant and
bosh to rely on Luck. He is always indo­
lent and whining, folding his arms, drink­
ing and smoking, waiting for big prizes in
lotteries, or lying abed expecting a letter
with news of a legacy. On the contrary.
Labor and Pluck are the invincible heroes
who conquer success; they strike out new
paths, create, contrive, think, plan, origi­
nate, take all legitimate risks, toil to sur­
mount obstacles, push forward, win renown
by success. The glorious galaxy of suc­
cessful business men and illustrous authors
have alt been bard workers. Shun bad
company and the prevalent vices of the
day, never loan a borrowing friend more
than you are able to lose if he cannot pay,
and never take a loan on importunity.
Never borrow money to speculate with.
Acquire knowledge. It is only enlighten­
ed men who successfully hold their own
with the surging masses who throng the
road to riches. Avoid law and legal squab­
bles of every kind. In discussing business
: disagreements, keep cool. Make all the
money you can and do all the good you can
with it. remembering that he who lives for
himself alone lives for the meanest man in
creation. If engaged in public business,
advertise it: be punctual in meeting promis­
ed payments; keep short accounts; settle
often; be clear and explicit in making bar­
gains. Be civil and obliging as well as de­
cisive and prompt with customers, and do
not overtrade your capital. Finally, in the
maturity of life, don't rust out by retiring
I from business; keep bright by useful effort,
remembering that industry and happiness
are inseparable.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038292/1889-01-12/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,mdu_douglass_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Democratic advocate.,William H.

Berlin, Feb. 17.—1 t is stated that the
government is willing to effect a settlement
of the Samoan question upon the basis of
the United States government’s proposal at
the Washington conference, namely, the
establishment of j 1 iut American, German
and English control over the Samoan gov­

SOME GERMAN DEMANDS.
London, Feb. 17.—The Standard's Ber­
lin correspondent says ho understands that
the German government is disposed to sus­
pend hostilities in Samoa during the
Samoan conference, b it only on condition
that tho estates belonging to German sub­
jects be evacuated by the Samoans, and
that the boundary lines of the bellig­
erents’ possessions bo marked and
respected. This cannot bo done offi­
cially, however, because Germany
regards Maraafa as a rebel leader and not
as king. The Frankfort Gazette suggests
that all three governments interested should
recall their present Samoan agents on the

His philosophical mind was singnlarly freo fiom

in tho people, which was accepted by but few of
his compatriots. Upon his famous axiom of the
quality of all men before the law, ho constructed
his system. It was the trip-hammer essential
for the emorgency to break the links binding

to write tho Declaration of Independence, and

beholding long, shining ringlets, miln white
skin and star-liko eyes, such as had reward­
ed the girl in tho story book, my own plain
little face looked at me in grieved surprise
from the mirror. I was, indeed, a sorry
enough sight with my frill awry, my hat on
exactly backwards ! And this, after my ef­
forts of weeks. 'Twas then I learned that
""the world was hollow and my doll was
stuffed with saw-dust."" That childish ex­
perience was not without its influence on
my character. I became a small cynic.
Now I have learned tho true meaning of
tho fairy tale.
Tho world of women pays too much heed
to its looking-glass the mere physical
beauty is gazed upon and thought of to the
neglect of all else, because there is a popular
belief afloat that only beautiful women are
attractive. Women who aro plain, beyond
all possibility of ever becoming handsome,
still devote their time to their personal
adornment, under tho impression that by
so doing they will become better looking
and more charming, when in reality if they
would turn their backs upon their mirrors
they might indeed far outshine the beauti­
ful women around them. If they would de­
vote the time they now waste in vain en­
deavors for physical improvement to culti­
vating their minds, improving their man­
ners and conversation, they would find, like
the maiden of the fairy tale, that the mirror
was ""a delusion and a snare.""
The most attractive women in society to­
day arc not tho acknowledged beauties in
many instances. Often wo see the homeliest
girl in an assemblage the recipient of tho
most favors, because of her bright manners,
her brilliant conversation, or her keen wit.
Such a one reigns supreme when tho in­
sipid beauty of the season is no longer ad­
mired. Beauty is of itself attractive; it
pleases tho eye and charms the beholder
for awhile, but beauty alone will not make
, a woman popular.
Women are much like flowers ; the. ones
that have beauty and mind, well cultivated,
are like tthe flowers with beauty and fra­
grancethey aro never-ending sources of
delight. OthtVrs are fair. to look upon, but a
close Inspection discovers a thorn. The
third kind aro like the homely wall flower,
neither handsome or graceful, but so full of
sweetness that to be near them is joy inex­
pressible. So maty girls, who are brought
up with the knowledge that they"" aro gifted
with forms and faces of unusual loveliness,
depend too much upon these advantages for
their success In hfo. They never rcaUco
tho necessity of applying themselves to tho
acquisition of knowledge vthcy grow to
womanhood with meager educations, no ac­
complishments, and a much ""exaggerated
opinion of their charms. Tho result Is that
they enjoy oifly for a brief time tho prestige
for which they are so ambitious.
Some of the plainest women I ever knew
were the greatest favorites. Their presenco
in a room was tho signal for good humored
enjoyment. Time never flagged when they
were of the party. The lack of mere facial
symmetry was forgotten Ttien under tho
spell of their genial influence. It is not un­
usual to see a handsome man wedded to a
homely woman. Wo have all heard, and
perhaps mode tho remark, ""Why, what did
such a good-looking man ever see in that
woman to lovei"" Wo aro thinking of only
the outward appearance, when, in truth, tho
character of such a woman may bo so love­
ly and attractive to those who know her that
none would have her different if they could.
It is a great pity when a girl allows herself
to grow discontented and unhappy about
her looks. Whon this is the case it is timo
for her to heed the fairy's warning and
shun the mirror by thinking less of appear­
ances and more of other things.
I know a most attractive girl, who is far
from pretty. I heard her once say in reply
to a remark that &ho was always so jolly
and pleasant: ""Yes, I have to be so or bo
considered a nonentity, for you know I
haven't Madge's beauty to take me over
dull places."" Andthi3 plain girl, by her
own efforts to ploasc, succeeded in. winning
friends and warm admirers on every hand.
She realized her lack of beauty, and know­
ing that she could never remodel the phys­
iognomy God had given her, she bent her
energies' in another direction, and made the
most of the heart and mind which it is pos­
sible for all to develop and improve. In
Europe to-day the Princess Mctternlch is
always greeted with enthusiasm and ad­
miration because of her gracious and win­
ning manner, although sho is universally
considered one of tho homeliest women in
society.
All women are capable of being attractive
if they would only exert themselves suffi­
ciently. Thero is whero the charm of the
homely woman lies in her desiro to make
the most of her capabilities. Realizing that
she has no beauty of feature, sho turns her
attention to becoming a fine conversational­
ist (a most delightful accomplishment, by

Now, if you only knew how to cook a
steak to make it good that would do, but
it always makes me sick to see a woman
cook a steak. She invariably puts her
frying fan on the stove, and puts in a
chunk of grease about as big as my list,
and when It is hot enough to begin to
crackle she puts in her beef, and never
thinks of covering it. The smoke and
steam from it goes up to the very ceiling.
After she cooks it this way until it begins
to look like an old rubber shoe sole she
calls it done. When you go to eat it there
is no more taste in it than a chip. Now,
if you want a good bit of steak, have a
clear, hot Are, set your clean, empty pan
on a spot, cover it up, theu pound your
steak, and when your pan is very hot lay
in your steak, and cover quickly.
As soon as it has crisped enough to let
go its hold on the pan, turn over and
cover quickly, turn again as at iirst, and
continue to do so about every two min­
utes until you have turned it about six or
eight times. Have a hot buttered dish
ready for it and lay it in; add a sprinkling
of pepper,_ salt and sugar, and cover
tightly. jSiow, if you wish a gravy, put a
bit of butter in your pan. When hot, rub
in a pinch of ilour, and a small teacupful
of boiling water, let it boil a few minutes,
then put in a gravy boat instead of put­
ting it over your beef to draw out the
juice. Now try this plan just once and
vmi will HPR vnii wnmpn know nothincr

about cooking a good steak.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87068097/1889-09-20/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,njr_ginger_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Jersey City news.,City Pub.

Riding in the Engrincer%€ab.
H. G. Frout says in the September
Scribner's:—We cannot tell^fisom the
timetables how fast we travel. The
schedule times do not indicate the
delays that must be made up by
spurts between stations. The travel­
ler who is curious to know/just how
fast he is going, and likes the stimu­
lus of thinking that he is ii& a little
danger, may find amusement in tak­
ing the time between mile posts and
when these are not to ba seen, he
«an often get the speed very accurate­
ly by counting the rails_p»ssed in a
given time. This may bet- done by
listening attentively at an open
window or door. The regular clicks
of the wheels over the railjoints can
usually soon be singled oufcirom the
other noises, and counted.. The num.
ber of rail-lengths passed! in twenty
seconds is almost exactly the num­
ber of miles run in an hour.

But if one wants to g©t a lively
sense of what it means to rush
through space at fifty GB- sixty miles
an hour he must get ©»a locomo­
tive. Then only does he- begin to re­
alize what trifles stand between him
and destruction. A few weeks ago a
lady sat an hour in th» cab of a lo­
comotive hauling a fast express traini
over a mountain roaeL She saw the­
narrow, bright line oi the rails andi
the slender points &i the switches*.
She heard the thundfer of the bridges,
and saw the track shut in by rocky
bluffs, and new perils suddenly re­
vealed as the engine swept arouad
sharp curves. Tb& experience wa&to
her magnificent* but the sense- oi
danger was almost appalling. To
have made her experience complete,
Bhe should have taken one engine
ride in a dark sad rainy night. In a
daylight ride on a locomotive* we
come to realize how slender is the
rail and how fragile its fastenings,
compared with the ponderous ma­
chine which they carry. We see what
a trifling movement of a switch
makes the difference between life and
death. We learn how short the look
ahead must often be, and how close
danger sits on either hand. But it is
only in a night ride that we learn
how dependent the engineer must be,
after all, upon the faithful vigilance
of others. The hpad-light reveals a
few yards of glistening rail, and the
ghostly telegraph poles and switch
targets. Were a switch open, a rail
taken up, or a pile of ties on the
track, we could not possibly see the
danger in time to stop.

Gulling Youthful Britons,
A Cedar Eapids, Iowa, dispatch to
the Chicago Herald says a sensation
has been created there by the publica­
tion of an article entitled ""A Great
Swindle,"" detailing the fleecing of
English boys out of sums of money
varying from $250 to $500 for the
privilege of working a year in this
country on a farm. There are in that
city more than a score who have
been duped by English firms and
placed by the local agents here. Be­
ing ashamed ot their verdancy they
never mentioned the matter, and it
was only through the confession of
Percy Cook.sixteen years old,who was
recently placed, that the whole mat­
ter came to light. The article gives
the names of twenty young men in
various positions in Cedar Bapids
now who came to this country under
the impression that they were to be­
come gentlemen farmers in a year.
The firm of Ford, Rath bone & Co.,
with headquarters at 21 Finsbury
payment, London, is the one that
has duped most of these boys. I
undertakes to provide a practical
instruction in farming in Canada, the
United States of America and Tas­
mania for gentlemen's sons who can
pay from fifty to one hundred and
fifty pounds."" The agents induce
these boys to believe they will have a
delightful time, with little work and
much sport, taking life moderately
as becomes a gentlemen's sons. This
was the impression given them, and
they came only to find that they had
the hardest kind of work and a total
absence of the luxuries which tney
had been led to expect. United States
Deputy Marshal L. M. Healy after
carefully looking up the law, has de­
clared the business to be a violation
of the contract labor law, each in­
fringement of which subjects to a
fine of not less than $500. I is un­
derstood that the marshal will take
legal steps against the local agents
who have been receiving fees for find­
ing places for the boys.

He Squanders a Quarter of a Million in
Less Than Six Years.
New York, October 14th—Another for­
tune has slipped through the fingers of
John L.Sullivan like water. The $20,000
which he received as a reward for his vic­
tory over Kilrain is gone, and Sullivan,
with a mistress and thousands of dollars of
debts on his hands, is dependent once more
on his friends for enough to get a drink.
All he wants now is a chance to make an­
other pile, and with the usual string of
good resolutions he has started in once
more to replenish his pocketbook. When
the articles of the Kilrain fight were signed
in Toronto Sullivan had to borrow $1,000
to get there. His training expenses were
paid by his backers. ""When the fight was
over he left New Orleans with $4,800. At
Nashville he was arrested, and ii took
$3,G00 to free him-$2,500 to lawyers who
talked wisely and $1,100 to the Court of­
ficials and the boys who did the real work.
Chicago's great spree cost him $000, and his
pocket was picked of nearly $4uo. He had
to borrow money to get to New York.
When the stake money was received by
him in New York John L. began the
princely act again. It was commonly sup­
posed that John L. got the whole of the
$20,000 of stake money, but Charley John­
son and Jim Wakely failed to present
Sullivan with their winnings on the stake.
Jim Willett, of the Illustrated A'eivs, how­
ever, did give his $5,000 stake and win­
nings. This made Sullivan's receipt from
the stakes only $15,000. The champion
established himself at the Vanderbilt
House with eleven retainers, all of whose
expenses he paid, and nothing was too
good for them. Sullivan was arrested by
Governor Lowry's minions, and, accom­
panied by a chosen few, returned to his old
battle-ground. He paid all the expenses
of the trip. He returned to the Vander­
bilt and enjoyed the same high living.
He returned to Boston with $2,000, all
that remained of his small fortune. As
soon as he reached Boston his creditors
presented their bills, but John L. could not

Hi $ old that Luna and lunacy have
an intimate relation appears to be not
wholly without foundation. This, at any
rate, is demonstrated by the commission­
ers in lunacy for Scotland—that the sea­
sons have a distinct influence on asylum
statistics. The tables of admissions dar­
ing the years 1880-7 show that there ore
two well marked periods—one in which
the number rises considerably above the
average, and the other in which it falls
considerably below. The average monthly
number for the eight years was 1,699.
During the three montiis of May, June
and July the number was 628 above what
it would have been if the average num­
ber only* had been admitted. On ths
other hand, during the months of Octo­
ber, November, December and January
the number was 402 below what it would
have been if the average number had
been admitted. The table shows further
that this rise and tiiis fall are preceded
by a gradual rise and a gradual fall, the
rise taking place during February. March
and April, and the fail taking place dur­
ing July, August and September.
“The special frequency,"" the commis­
sioners say, “with which asylum treat­
ment is resorted to during the period
from the middle of April to the middle
of July corresponds with what has been
olMserved by asylum physicians—that
there is a tendency to an exacerbation of
the mental disorder of patients in asy­
lums during tho early part of summer;
and it is interesting to notice also that
the statistics of suicide in the general
population show that this occurs most
frequently during the same period.”
The greatest number of recoveries take
place during June, July and August, and
they are fewest during tho months of
November, January and February. The
regularity in the rise and full of the num­
bers is twice interrupted. The rise is in­
terrupted by a fall in April, and the fall
is interrupted by a rise in December. “It
is considered probable that these inter­
ruptions are duo to some causes which
recur regularly at these periods, because
they are well marked in character; and
it is suggested that tho December rise is
occasioned, in part at least, by the an­
nual statutory revision of the condition
of patients in asylums during that month.
This revision is made by medical officers
of asylums with a view to determine
whether they can properly give the cer­
tificate of tho necessity for further deten­
tion in the asylum which is annually re­
quired to legalize the continued residence
of all patients who have been three years
in an asylum. The occurrence of the!
large number of recoveries during the
months of June, July and August is
probably due to the large number of ad-1
missions during May, June and July, as
more than 48 per cent, of all the recover­
ies which take place during the first year
of residence occur within three months
of the date of admission.”—Pall Mall

Brooklyn. February 9. The Bev. T.
De Witt Talmage, D. D., resumed preach­
ing in Brooklyn this morning, after his visit
to the Holy Land, and the Academy of
Music was crowded. Thousands of people
were not able to get into the bnilding. The
subject of his discourse was ""The House on
the Wall."" Dr. Talmage took for his text
Joshua vi, 23: ""And the young men that
were spies went in, and brought out Bahab,
and her father, and her mother, and her
brethren, and ill that she had."" He said:
When, only a few weeks ago, I visited
Jericho, I said, can it be possible that this
dilapidated place is the Jericho that Hark
Antony gave as a wedding present to Cleo­
patra? Where are the groves of palm trees?
Where are Herod's palaces that once stood
here? Where is the great theater from the
stage of which Salome told the people that
Herod was dead? Where is the sycamore
tree on the limb of which Zaccheus sat when
Jesus passed this place? Where is the
wreck of the walls, that fell at the blowing
of the ram's horns? But the fact that all
these have disappeared did not hinder me
from seeing in imagination the smash of
everything on the fated day, save one house
on the wall. That scene centuries ago
comes back to me as though it were yester­
day.There is a very sick and sad house in the
city of Jericho. What is the matter? Is it
poverty? No. Worse than that. Is it lep­
rosy? No. Worse than that Is it death?
No. Worse than that. A daughter has
forsaken her home. By what internal plot
she was induced to leave I know not; but
they look in vain for her return.
HOPE CBUSHED TO EABTH.
Sometimes they hear a footstep very much
like hers, and they start up and say: ""She
comes!"" but only to sink back again into
disappointment. Alas! Alas! The lather
sits by the honr, with his ftce in his hands,
saying not one word. The mother's hair is
becoming gray too fast, and she begins to
stoop so that those who saw her only a little
while ago in the street know her not now as
she passes. The brothers clench their fists,
swearing vengeance against the despoiler of
their home. Alas! will the poor soul never
come back? There is a long, deep shadow
over all the househoold. Added to this
there is an invading army six miles away,
just over the river, coming on to destroy the
citv; and what with the loss of their child
and the coming on of that destructive army,
I think the old people wished that thev
could die.
That is the first scene in this drama of
the Bible. In a house on the wall of the
city is that daughter. That is her home
now. Two spies have come from the invad­
ing army to look around through Jericho
and see how best it may be taken. Yonder
is the lost child, in that dwelling on the
wall of tne city. The police hear of it and
soon there is a shuffling of feet all around
about the door, and the city government de­
mands the surrender of those two spies,
first, Bahab for that was the name ot the
lost child first, Bahab secretes the two
spies and gets their pursuers off the track;
but after awnile she says to them: ""I will
make a bargain with you. I will save your
life if you will save my life, and the life of
my lamer ana my mother, and my brothers,
and my sisters, when the victorious army
comes upon the city.""
HOME SEVER FORGOTTEN.
O, she had not forgotten her home yet,
you see. The wanderer never forgets home.
Her heart breaks now as she thinks of how
she has maltreated her parents, and she
wishes she were back with them again, and
she wishes she could get away from her sin­
ful enthrallment; and sometimes she looks
up in the face of the midnight, bursting into
agonizing tears. No sooner have these two
spies promised to save her life, and the life
of her father, and mother, and brothers, and
sisters, than Bahab takes a scarlet cord and
ties it around the body of one of the spies,
brings him to the window, and, as he clam­
bers out nervous lest she have Dot strength
to hold him with muscular arms such as a
woman seldom has, she lets him down, hand
over hand, in safety to the ground.
Not being exhausted, she ties the cord
around the other spy, brings him to the
window, and jnst as successfully lets him
down to the ground. No sooner have these
men untied the scarlet cord from their
bodies than they look up, and they sav:
""You had better get all your friends in this
house your father, your mother, your
brothers and your sisters; you had better get
them in this house. And then, after vou
have them here, take this red cord which
you have put around our bodies and tie it
across the window; and when our victorious
army comes up, and sees that scarlet thread
in the window, they will spare this bouse
and all who are in it. Shall it be so?"" cried
the spies. ""Aye, aye,"" said Bahab, from
the window, ""it shall be so.""
SECOND AND THIRD SCENES. ""
That is the second scene in this Bible
drama. There is a knock at the door ot the
old man. He looks up, and says: ""Come
in,"" and lol there is Bahab, the lost child;
but she has no time to talk. Thev ratner
in excitement around her, and she says to
them: ""Get readv quickly, and co'with
me to my house. The army is coming! The
trumpet! Make haste! Fly! The enemy!'
That is the third scene in this Bible
drama. The hosts of Israel are all around
about the doomed city ot Jericho. Crash !
goes the great metropolis, heaps on heaps.
The air suffocating with the dust, and hor­
rible with the screams of a dying city. All
the houses flat down. All the people dead.
Ah no, no. On a crag of the wall the
only piece of the wall left standing there
is a house which we must enter. There is a
family there that have been spared. Who
are they? Let ns go and see. Bahab, her
jaiuer, uer mumer, ner Drotners, her sisters,
all safe, and the only house left standing in
all tbejeity. What saved them ? Was the
house more firmly built? O, no; it was
built in the most perilous place on the
wall; and the wall was the first thing that
fell. Was it because her character was any
better than any of the other population of
the citv? O. no. Why then was she spared,
and all her household? Can you tell me
why? O, it tras the scarlet line in the
window. That is the fourth scene in this
Bible drama. When the destroying angel
went through Egypt, it was the blood of the
lamb on the door-posts that saved the Is­
raelites; and nowthat vengeance has come
upon Jericho it is the same color that as­
sures the safety of Bahab and all her house­
hold. ITTST BE MEANS OF RESCUE.
My friends, there are foes coming upon
us, more deadly and more tremendous, to
overthrow our immortal interests. They
will trample us down aud crush us out for­
ever, unless there be some skillful mode of
rescue open. The police of death already
begin to clamor for our surrender; but,
blessed be God, there is a way out It is
through the window, and by a rope so satu­
rated with the blood ofthe cross, that it is
as red as that with which the spies were low­
ered; and if once our souls shall be deliv­
ered, then, the scarlet cord stretched across
the window of our escape, we may defy all
bombardment, earthly and satanic.
In the first place,' carrying out the idea of
my text, we must stretch this scarlet cord
scrossthewindowofourrescue. There comes
a time when a man is surrounded. What is
that in the front door of his soul? It is the
threatening of the future. What is that in
the back door ot his soul? It is the sin of
wepasi. no cannot get out oi eitntror I

those doorways. If he attempt it he will
be cut to pieces. What shall, he do? Escape
through the window of God's mercy. That
sunshine has been pouring in for many a
day. God's inviting mercy. God's par­
doning mercy. God's all-conquering
mercy. God's everlasting mercy. But, you
say, the window is so high. Ah there is a
rope, the very one with which the cross and
its victim were lifted. That'was strong
enough to hold Christ, and it is strong
enough to hold you. Bear all your weight
upon it, all your hopes for this life, all your
hopes for the life that is to come.
THE BEST ALTERNATIVE.
Escape now through the window. ""But,""
you say, ""that cord is too small to save me;
that salvation will never do at all for such a
sinner as I have been J' I suppose that the
rope with which Bahab let the two spies to
the ground was not thick enough; but they
took that or nothing. And, my. dear
brother, that is your alternative. There is
only one scarlet line that can save you.
There have been hundreds and thousands
who have been borne away in safety by that
scarlet line, and it will bear yon away in
safety. Do you notice what a very narrow
escape those spies had? I suppose they
came with flustered cheek and with excited
heart They had a very narrow escape.
They went in the broad door of sin; but how
did thev come out? They came out of the
window. They went up by the stairs of
stone they came down on a slender thread.
And so, mv friends, we go easily and una

bashedly into sin, and all the doors are
open; bnt if we get out at all it will be by
being let down over precipices, wriggling
and helpless, the strong grip above keeping
us from being dashed on the rocks beneath.

some of the bird-shot got in on each and
every one of the gang, and we had to tap
one of the end-men with an axe-helve in
addition. We haven't any one in this
town who makes a specialty of digging
lead out of the human system, and at
noon they started for Tombstone to give
a man there a week's job. Hie jacket !
which is Mexican for saying : The Kicker
is always loaded.
We Told You So. Six weeks ago a
man named Scott opened a grocery store
on Comanche street, and when we cas­
ually dropped in and mentioned the fact
that the Kicker was the best advertising
medium in the West, he didn't enthuse.
We knew there was something wrong
about him, and we sent his description to
the sixty-f our sheriffs and chiefs of police
who are constantly in communication
with us.
Last Thursday, just after we had gone
to press, a detective arrived from Louis­
ville and collared Mr. Scott, who is a de­
faulting county treasurer. He has left
us, and we bought the stock of groceries
at about 22 cents on the dollar. Had Mr.
Scott advertised he would doubtless have
built up a large and profitable business,
but he took a wrong view of at and will
probably go to State prison for fifteen or
twenty years.
Poor Old Palsy ! We never refer to
our contemporary down the street if we
can avoid it. In the first place, he hasn't
got enough brains or office to deserve the
title, and in the next he is a poor palsied
old man who is gradually dying of envy
and starvation, and we shall have to foot
his burial expenses when he does go.
The other week we mentioned our private
graveyard and its five occupants. This
so excited the jealousy of the old relic of
the seventeenth century that he borrowed
a revolver and took a trip around town
yesterday in search of blood. He finally
found one of Col. McCracken's Digger
Indians asleep in the sun, and opened fire
on him from a distance of four feet. He
didn't even wake the redskin up, and
Judge Tillman, who objected to so much
noise around his house, went out and
drove poor old palsy away with a broom.
We are sorry for him. They say he
cried while going back to his one-horse
alleged newspaper, and no wonder. He
should never have come West. He came,
as we ascertained, to evade arrest for
bigamy, but he should have taken some
other route. When nature fits a man to
raise hollyhocks in New Jersey, he has
no business coming West to try to raise
that other product.
Not His Fault. A number of our
towns-people have expressed the hope
that we would pitch into Dr. Staghorn,
the popular druggist, for killing old man
Slew by putting up arsenic for quinine in
a prescription. We shall do nothing of
the sort The doctor has not only in­
creased his advertising one-half this week,
but has subscribed for five copies of the
Kicker to send away. While this of
course does not influence us in the least,
we know from personal observation that
the doctor is a very busy man, and that
the room in his store is limited. He has
no choice but to keep many different sorts
of powders in the same drawer and it is
only to be expected that a mistake should
happen now and then.
Furthermore, who was old Slew, any­
how? A lazy, dissipated vagabond,
whom the boys would have hung in the
course of a few weeks at best. In foot­
ing his f unt-ral expenses the doctor has
shown himself very liberal and fair­
minded, and he has shown himself in
various ways to belong to that class
wanted in this town to build it up.

work digging potatoes in a field in the
valley of the Rimac. A team of oxen
plowed up the hills with a light plow,
leaving the tubers exposed on the
ground. Six Indian workman picked
up the potatoes, and carried them to
a pile in one corner of the field, while
the overseer, a Spaniard, stood watch­
ing the work. The men who were pick­
ing up the potatoes had neither pail
nor bag nor box in which to carry
them. Two of them put the potatoes
in their hats, and the others carried
them in their hands, each one going
from every part of the field to the pile
in one corner, carrying five or six po­
tatoes each trip.

Jackson, Miss., June 21.?A conference of
colored men of this state yesterday promul­
gated an address to their race in which they
declare that the constitutional convention to
assemble here August 12 is designed bv the
democratic party to abridge, if not to practi­
cally destroy, their liberties. They de­
clare that the negroes as a race should
be represented in the convention and urge that
negro organizations be atonco formed iu every
county where they are in a majority or have a
chance of election, with the view to the elec­
tion of negro delegates. Where negroes stand
no chance of election they are urged to vote
for white men who they think will extend jus­
tice to their race.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1890-06-21/ed-1/seq-5,"","",5,"","",1,dlc_otterhound_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Evening star.,W.D.

Dyspepsia
Makes the llrei ot many people miserable,
and often leads to self-destruction. Distress
after eating, sour stomach, sick headache,
heartburn, lots ot appetite, a faint, ""all gone""
feeling, bad taste, coated tongue, and irregu­
larlty of the bowels, are
Distress soma of the more common
Aft Or symptoms. Dyspepsia does
t, not get well of Itself. It
Kaimg requires careful, persistent
attention, and a remedy like Hood's Barsa­
Iiarula, which acts gently, yet surely and
efficiently. It tones tbe stomach and other
organs, regulates the digestion, creates a
good appetite, and by thus Sink
overcoming the local symp- ' 7 i r
toms removes the sympa-HSQCiaCn
thetle effects of the disease, banishes the
headache, and refreshes the tired mind.
"" I have been troubled with dyspepsia. I
bad but littlo appetite, and what I did eat

""uurl little good. In an hour
OUrn after eating I would expe­
rience a talntness, or tired, all-gono feeling,

The development of the American col­
onies, their rapid growth in the century
preceding the American revolution, de­
pended in a large measure on a botanical
accident, viz., ou the introduction of to­
bacco into the commerce of the world. No
contribution from newly discovered lands
has ever been so welcomed as this so-called
noxious weed. No new faith has
ever traveled so fast nud far among
men as tho habit of smoking. In scarce a
century from tho first introduction of the
fdant in Europe, its use had spread to near­
y half the peoples of the old world. Tho
Eastern coast of America, from the Hudson
southward to South Carolina, is peculiaily
well suited for the growth of the tobacco
plant, and the rapid extension of the Brit­
ish colonies in America, which brought
their population at tho time of the revolu­
tion to a point whero they numbered about
one-sixth part of the English people, was
largely duo to tho commerce which rested
upon the use of this plant.

All valuable matter to be sent by mail should
be registered. It will thus receive such protec­
tion as it is always possible to give to matter
sent in the ordinary mails. Money should be
sent by money order or registered letter.
Proprietors of hotels should omit the return
request from envelopes supplied gratuitously
to their guests; uud guests using envelopes
furnished by hotels, should be careful to de­
signate what disposal should lie made of letters
sent by them in ease of non-delivery.
On mail matter to foreign countries, es­
pecially Canada and England, in which many
post offices huvo the same name as offices in the
United States, the name of the country, as well
as the post offices should be given in full.
In sending packages and parcels—books,
pamphlets, and other articles—by mail, the ad­
dress should be placed on the article inclosed
as well as on the wrapper.
Should the wrappers become detached, as
they frequently do, through the h nailing in­
cident to mail transportation l>y sea or land, it
may still be possible to restore the article if
this precaution is taken.
While the efficiency of the postal system and
service has attained high standard, the public
may materially aid in the fuller and more com­
plete delivery of its mail matter, or the prompt
return of the same to the sender in eases where
delivery from any cause cannot be effected, if
the foregoing suggestions are conformed to.

both within the home and without, what
problems, what complications, what vicis­
situdes, what dangers do we perceive en­
vironing them! As the best beginning we
know how to make, we educate them in all
the learning of the schools; we send them to
college; they become linguists and musicians
and artists. We recognize the significance
of personal attractiveness, and encourage
them to pay attention to all those adorn­

nity. If, while the bloom of youth is still
fresh upon their cheeks, the good and
faithful son of some other parents offers
his lore and his hand, and that love Is
reciprocated, we perhaps think for a little
that the problem is solved. The normal
destiny of a young woman is apparently
accomplished, we say, when she becomes
the wife of the man whom she loves and
who loves her. A home, wifehood, mother­
hood, tender love of husband and children—
what have wo left to desire for our daugh­

A great mistake perhaps was mado when
Dr. Sherman namec his great remedy Prick­
ly Ash Bitteks; but it is presumed that at
that time all remedies for the blood, etc,
were called Bitters. Had he called it Prick­
ly Ash 'Regulator,"" ""Curative,"" or almost
anything but Bi'ters, it undoubtedly -would
have superseded all other preparations of
similar character. The name Bitters is mis­
leading; it is purely a medicine, and cannot

Wages and the extension of tlie inheri­

FACTS F011 THE FARMEK.

VALUE OF INTELLIGENT EXPER­
IMENTS IN FARMING.

A Single Tost Is Not Euougli It Must be Bepeated
—Farm Mints—Lire Stock Items—Too
Many Varieties—Valaable Point­
era Tor the Agrlcntturlst.

Value of Experiments.

In a majority of cases in order to be
of practical value, experiments con­
corning different plans of farm man­
agement must be repeated often sev­
eral times. Often because this is not
done, serious mistakes are made.
Often a new method of planting1 or
cultivating is tried, not alongside of
another that is being managed by the
old pi m, so that the tost can be made
bv itself. If the result is favorable
the plan is often taken to be an im­
provement without considering the
other circumstances that may have in­
fiueiK-ed the result. Every year new
plans or methods of fighting insect
pests, that are injurious to farm, gar­
den or fruit crops are sent out, nine­
tenths of which are of no value wherev­
er the pests appear. They work first
rate where there are but few if any
pests, the remedy that proved a success
where there wa9 nothing to fight, is of
no value.

Because success has seemingly been
obtained one year, the remedy is sent
out as being reliable. The same holds
good with many new plans or methods
of farm work one trial is made, and
if success is obtained the method is
duly rccomended. Failures are but
little spoken about, but if a second
trial is given with better results, how
quick tho fact becomes known. With
farm work, tho real facts can only be
learned by successive experiments
carefully carried out. What may be a
success one year under certain condi­
tions, will often prove a failure the
next under different circumstances.
Wo have learned thoroughly that what
will bo a success on one kind of soil,
or with one plan of planting, or culti­
vating, is no proof that it will answer
under unlirely different conditions, so
that success in one locality is no
criterion that it is just the thing to do
in another. Varieties of fruit, grain
or vegetables that thrive well and
yield good crops in one locality, will
prove a failure in another because the
conditions are different, and in many
cases, especially with grain, the second
crop will give better results than the
first, because tho variety is becoming
acclimated. New varieties often prove
successful because of the extra care
given. The seed has been purchased
at a high price, and tho farmer is dis­
posed to secure the best possible re­
sults and because of the extra pains
taken, succeeds. Another trial with
average p: eviration and cultivation,
and the remits are not so satisfactory.#
In many eases a better plan is to
make comparative tests, planting some
of tho new varieties along side of an
old standard, one that lias been fully
tested give as nearly the same soil,
preparation and cultivation as possi­
ble, and save the best of each for seed
and give a second trial the results the
second year while not always con­
clusive, may at least be instructive.
In many cases more satisfactory re­
sults and considerable practical in­
formation can be secured if the same
plan is followed with new methods of
planting and cultivating. Farm ex­
periments are always interesting, pro­
vided they are of such a nature as to
be practical, and aro conducted in
such a way as to be reliable.

Farm Hints.

A paint brush is a handy implement
in oilinjr harness. If there is no
shade in the pasture put some there.
It is not a good pasture without it.
lhe buggy and tool house should not
be built against the stable. Ceilings
that have been smoked by a kerosene
lamp should be washed off with soda
water. Over-working butter makes
it whiter as well as softer—Don't.
If we breed our colts in the autumn
we reduce their cost, us the mare can
do team work all summer. Tan some
lamb skins to put in the bottom of the
carriage for warm feet. It takes the
best kind of brains to make a good
farmer. If you have a dull boy edu­
cate him for a profession. It is a good
time to dig a well when the waters are
low, for if found then the supply will
be likely to bo permanent. The man
who grows into any special branch
oi farming is more likely to succeed
in it than the one who goes into
it. Many a fence is maintained to
protect crops from stock, the combined
value of which would not equal the
cost of the fence. Teach tho colt some
usoiul lesson every week this winter—
something that will have a bearing
upon their life work. Never ""break
them."" Remember that a colt is only
a boy horse. If all the grain sacks are
put into one and then suspended by a
wire from a joist overhead, the mice
will not gnaw them. The surest way
to renew an old pasture is to scatter
manure over it in the autumn and sow
the seed right afterward. Red top and
blue grass are the surest to grow and
to bo permanent. Leather may be
blackened with tho following: Powder­
ed fine extract of logwoodand bicromate
of pot sh, each one ounce, in half a
pillon of boiling rain water. Ia a
corked bottle this mixturo will keep
safely.—l'arm Journal.

Too Many Varieties.

Nearly all fruit growers plant at
first mainly for home use, and often

with limited ideas as to the fitness of
any one variety for their locality and
market. As a consequence, when the
tree come into bearing it is found that
there are too many kinds, and some of
these never likely to be profitable.
There was wisdom in the remark of
an old farmer that if he hud 100 apple
trees to sell the fruit, ninety-nine of
them should be Baldwins. ""And what
should the other tree be?"" he was
asked. After thinking a moment, he
replied, ""That would be Baldwin loo.""

Live Stock Items

A lazy acre of land is as costly a
possession as a lazy, balky horse or a
dry cow. It costs something to keep,
interest on money, taxes, repair of
fences, etc., and brings nothing in. A
lazy acre of land always points to a
lazy owner.

Sugar beets are the most valuable
of all feeding roots. They contain
nearly us much sugar as potatoes do
starch, but as the starch in tho food is
always converted into sugar before it
is digested, the sugar is the more
valuable food. Every particle of the
sugar beet is digestible and can be
fed without loss when fed with hay.

A farmer should count, weigh or
measure everything he buys or sells.
A platform scale will save its cost in
two or three years. Every time a
farmer sells by guess he loses, because
he cannot be as good a guesser as a
buyer who is continually at it, and
the odds are against him in the pro­
portion of the more experience of the!
buyer.

One acre of good pea vine clover
and timothy if pastured will summer
one cow or one horse. But if the
clover is] cut and fed to the animals,
the acre will summer two head. Sup­
posing that a little more labor is, re­
quired to do this, is not a saving of
one half the feeding worth it when
one man can thus supply thirty head
of cattle?

The animal system contains seventy­
five per cent, of water, the rest is
solid matter if the water is impure,'
seventy-five per cent, of the system be­
comes vitiated and as tho water ia
dispersed through the whole system,
the animal becomes completely im­
pregnated with impuritiesi It is not
at all strange therefore that the most,
serious diseases are caused by impure
water.

Farm Notes.

Grooming tho horse aids to keep1 the
pores of the skin open, and in this way
aids materially to keep the animals in
good health.

If sheep are fed on the ground they
will run over and trample down more
or less of their feed, and then will re­
fuse to eat it.

In all feeding it is the food that is
digested that affords the nutriment'
and not the amount of food that is
taken into the stomach.

By feeding bran and oil-meal to
stock on the farm the objection to sell­
ing grain is partly overcome, as both
these materials return to the soil al­
most their full value as fertilizers.

In marketing poultry quality, is
quite an item, and the highest prices
at any season can- only be realized by
taking the necessary pains both in
feeding and preparing for market, to
have them of the best quality.

The question of profit and economy
in the production of beef cattle is one
that every farmer should study. They
must be made ready for market at as
low a cost as possible, without lower­
ing the quality of the product.

When the cow's hind legs are so
close together that you cannot have
full view of the udder from behind, or
rub against it so as to make the udder
swing backward and forward, you ean
depend upon it she is not correctly
built for a first-class cow. The teats
should be full size and set well apart,
says the American Dairyman.

Bereaved*

Let mo come in where you sit weeping­
aye,
Let mo, who have not any child to die,
Weep with, you for the little one whose
love

I havo known nothing of.

The little arms that slowly, slowly loosed
Their pressure round your neck—the hands
you used
To kiss. Such arms, such hands I never
knew,

May I not weep with you?

Fain would I be of service—say something
Between the tears that would be comfort­
in.?,
But ah! so sadder than yourselves am I,

Who havo no child to die.

How Stonewall Jaskson

D.ed.

Historians always stop to describe
the dying of Wolfe-and Montcalm, tho
two opposing commanders in the bat­
tle of Quebec. But their deaths were
simply horoic compared with the
Christian death of Stonewall Jackson.

About 1:30 on the day of his death
he was told that he had about two
hours to live, and he answerod feebly
but firmly: ""Very good it is all
right.""

A few moments before he died he
cried out in his delirium: ""Order A.
P. Hill to prepare for action. Pass
the infantry to the front rapidly.
Major Hawks then stopped
ing the sentence unfinished.

Presently a smile of ineffable sweet­
ness spread itself over his pale face
and then he said quietly and with an
expression of relief: ""Let us cross
over the river aud rest under the
shade of the trees."" And then, with­
out pain or the least struggle, his
spirit passed.—Philadelphia Press.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88076144/1890-12-05/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,ndhi_carbon_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Oakes weekly Republican.,Ellis & Buxton,"Oakes, Dickey County, D.T.

A TRAGEDY OF ERKOES.
It was after Mrs. Jeffreys, still a
young and pretty woman, was dressed
for dinner, and silting at the window
with, her embroidery, that she saw a
messenger boy crawl up the street,
stop to throw a stone al another boy,
and finally ring her door bell.
A moment after this, Bella, the ""up-
stairs girl,"" brought her a note. It
was from Jo friend, Edwin Jones,
familiarly Ned, who had come from
afar to pay her a visit, and being tim­
orous, had decided to wait at the
depot until she came to meet her.
There was no time to lose. Mrs.
Jeffries gave a few directions to her
cook, and hurried away.
Half an hour after she had gone Mr.
Jeffries returned home and let him­
self in with his latch key, wondering
that his wife did not come to meet
.him.
Mr. Jeffries had been a very jealous
man before he married. He confessed
it Ho would not permit any one to
pay the least attention to his Emma
Jane. Even cousins of the first de­
gree made him suffer pangs of grief
unknown when they called of Sunday
afternoous, and an uncle, who was
unusually young for that relationship,
while as yet unknown, had driven him
to the most serious thoughts of suicide,
for Emma Jane had kissed him in the
front hall.
'Do jou really think, Jefferson
Jeffries, that I can endure such con-
duct.'1""
hib Emma Jane had remarked.
""Is, it possible that any one can be put
up with being followed around like
that, and stared at like that? Do you
think I will?"" and then she had given
him back her ring, and he had ground
it under foot.
However, he bought her another in
a month or so, and they made it up
and married and Mr. Jeffries, warned
by the past, had behaved himself very
well, indeed, and ho had never \et
been jealous of his wife, when one
afternoon August he came home
Barly to dinner and found her ""gone
out""
""Bella, diddshe say where she was
going-01
1
Hfr
aske Mr Jeffries
""1N0, sir,"" said rJella. ""She gave
out the things for desert and went out
in a hurrv loike, in her best- things,
just after she got a note loike, brought
by a boy dressed like a tallygraph.""
""Ah!"" said Mr. Jeffries. ""I trust
her mother is not ill. It really seems
as though something must have hap­
pened.""
He went up stairs when he had said
this, and looked about him for the
message, which, doubtless, she had
left lying somewhere. He could see
none. He opened the drawer in which
Emma Jane kept her trifles of lace
and ribbon and quilted muslin and
-still saw nothing. But, glancing into
4he waste-paper basket, he discovered
a twisted paper, and, as it was the last
of the little heap, picked it out and
enfolded it.
Spreading out the wrinkles, he put
his glasses on his nose and read. And
as he read his cheeks grew pale, for
these were the words:
DEAREST EMMA AXE Meet me on the
New York side of Twenty-third-street
ferry. I long to see you after our long
parting Yours very, very fond, NED.
""Ned!"" ejaculated Mr. Jeffries
""Ned!"" He ground his teeth and
clenched his fists. He could have
howled with rage, but for the propri­
eties, which we generally observe in
our greatest agonies. This was the
2nd of it all, then Emma Jane had
gone to meet her old beau. Old or
new, who could tell? A lover, any­
how. He tried to be calm but he
could not believe himself mistaken.
He knew her brothers and cousins
well. They were Peter. Paul, Wil­
liam, Elias, Samuel and James. Even
her father, who would not have signed
ihis first name, Adoniram. There was
no way out of it.
""No end but one,"" thought Mr. Jef­
fries as he sought for the pistol gener­
ally kept on hand for possible burg­
lars. ""I must follow them, find them,
shoot him first, her next and myself
last No one shall know why but the
traitress will know as she dies!""
He put the pistol in his pocket,
crowded his hat over his eyes and
rushed out of the door. A Twenty­
third-street car was passing, he jump­
ed into it and retired to a corner, fold­
ing his arms.
""Fare!"" cried the driver. Mr.
Jeffries mechanically deposited some­
thing in the box and sank into his
*eat again. A volley of shocking re­
proaches from the driver aroused him.
He found the passengers glaring at
him.
""I've had this trick played on me
before!"" cried the driver through the
door. ""You're a nice one, ain't you,
at your age, to put a coat button into
the box?""
Mr. Jeffries received the remark
without an answer, and repaired his
error by putting a quarter into the
same aperture into which he had
dropped the button.
""My belief is you are crazy,"" re­
marked the driver.
""Oh, yes!"" responded an old lady,
shaking her head.
Mr. Jeffries only groaned. What
was silver to him? He rode on, the
object of much comment
Shortly after a friend entered the
-car. He was a mm of jovial disposi­
tion, and, as he said, fond of hia joke.
After nodding and smiling in vain, he
bethought himself to poke Mr. Jeffries
via the ribs with tbe immense knob of the handle of his umbrella,. Taking
the passengers into his confidence by
a knowing wink, he stole forward and
perpetrated his joke.
The ""punch"" was a hard one the
result an explosion. If any one had
tried to fire the pistol iu that manner
he would have failed. Accidentally
Mr. Joblins hud done it
Mr. Jeffries gave a groan, started up
and foil forward on his face, blood
trickling over his stocking. The car
stopped, and policemen carred Mr.
Jeffries into a drug store. The peni­
tent Joblings was in custody, having
voluntarily delivered himself over to
justice. The wound was not perhaps
a dangerous one, but Jeffries remained
unconscious. Joblings accompanied
him to his home in a cab, and having
told the tale in a court of justice, was
permitted to go free on his own bail.
And just as Jefferson Jeffries opened
his eyes his Emma Jane arrived at her
door in a cab, with a trunk fastened
on behind marked ""E. J.,"" and a young
lady within in a plum-colored cloth
traveling suit.
""My dear, dear Jeffy hurt!"" cried
the poor wife, as Bella told the tale.
""Oh, let me go to him!""
Away she rushed up the stairs to
the bedroom above and bent over her
husband's pillow.
""Jeffy, dear!"" she sobbed but, to
her consternation, Jefferson opened
his eyos, looked at her, and said:
""Leave me, woman'""
""It isn't a woman. It's your own
Emmy,"" sighed Mrs. Jeffries.
""Take her away!"" said Jefferson.
""Is he delirious, doctor?"" asked
poor Emma Jane, trembling.
""No, madam,"" replied that gentle­
man, gravely.
""Then what does this mean?"" asked
the poor woman.
""Madam,"" said the doctor, the most
solemn of his profession, which is say­
ing much, ""madam, I have no desire
to pry into your domestic difficulties.""
""My domestic difficulties? 1 never
had any. Oh, dear, dear Jeffy, speak
to your Emmy,' sobbed Mrs. Jeffries.
But her Jefferson only replied by
saying in deep chest notes:
""Crocodile! Take her away! The
sight of her is madness. Will no one
rid me of her presence?""
""Oh, Mr. Joblings, tell me what he
means!""
""Beg pardon, madam, I must request
you to retire."" answered Mr. Joblings,
all his nature apparently turned to gall.
""You alone know the meaning of those
awful words.""
Poor Emma Jaue. She rushed down
stairs when the door of her own room
had actually been closed upon her, and
told her incoherent story to her friend.
""I've seen him je ilous before,"" she
said, ""but not like this. What can
it mean?""
""What did you do? Whom is he
jealous of?"" asked the other woman.
""Oh, Ned, I don't know,"" sobbed
Emma Jane.
And Edwina Jones concluded very
naturally that Emma had been flirting
terribly with several individuals.
Thus, wronged by all, even her girl­
hood's friend Mrs. Jeffries abandoned
herself to despair.
A bullet in the calf seldom kills,
and, as was extracted promptly, the
wound healed and Jefferson Jeffries
began to recover, but he still refused
to see his wife and on the first day
of his convalescence he summoned his
lawyer and sent him to Emma Jane
empowered to effect a separation.
""This letter is my reason,"" he said,
with a dreadful groan, thrusting the
crumpled note into his hand. ""I was
on my way to shoot the fellow when
Joblings managed to shoot me. She
shall keep the house if she likes, but
I never wish to see her again.""
With this message the lawyer sought
the unhappy lady, and in the presence
of Edwina Jones interviewed her.
""One comfort at least I shall get
from this,"" said Mrs. Jeffries, with
dignity. ""I shall know my crime.""
""Mr. Jeffries opines that this will
explain,"" said ""the lawyer, presenting
her with the crumpled letter, which
with its signature suggested very
dreadful things indeed.
Emma Jane took it in her hand,
looked at it, and then handed it to her
friend.

lawyer elevated his
'Ned' at home,"" said
""Surely Mr. Jeffries
knew that Oh, Emma Jane, how I
have wronged you in my heart.""
Explanations followed.
The lawyer, choking down his
laughter, returned to Mr. Jeffries'
apartment, and gave them to that
gentleman with dramatic effect. Never
had he more trouble in preserving the
grave dignity proper to his position,
when Jefferson Jeffries, clasping his
hands together, ejaculated:
'Edwina Jones!' Of course I knew.
But I forgot her very existence. How
I have wronged my wife! Wretch
that I am, can she ever ""forgive me?""
""Never!"" Emma Jane decided.
""You have disgraced me before your
friends, before strangers, cast sus­
picion on me and insulted me by word
and deed. I demand a separation.""
Then she went home to her parents,
and Jefferson Jeffries was left alone
to reflect on his ridiculous conduct.
He was obliged to explain to tho
doctors, to Joblingo, to everybody,
and he suffered agonies of shame. He
longed for his Emma, whom he loved
raore than ever, and he writhed under
thu reproaches of her mother and
father and the menaces of her big
brothers. When he was able he used
to go along at midnight and stare up
at h's wife's window, and by day haunt
her steps unseen when she went out
walking. At Inst he followed hov to
church one Sunday. She was alone in
her pew. He entered and sat down
beside her. When the hymn was
given out he offered her his hymn­
book. Over it their heads met.
""Oh, Jefferson, how could you?""
she whispered, but that evening
went back home again. She felt that
Mr. Jeffries had had his lesson and
would profit by it for the rest of his
existence.

A SIMPLE MAN.
Portrait of a Kontucky Minister of tho
Time.
Olden
A tall, thinnish man, with silky pale
brown hair, worn long and put back
behind his ears, the high tops of
which bent forward a little under the
weight, and thus took on the most re­
markable air of paying incessant at­
tention to everybody and everything
set far out in front of those ears, as
though it did not wish to be disturbed
by what was heard, a white, wind­
splitting face, calm, beardless, and
seeming never to have been cold, or
to have dropped the kindly dew of
perspiration under the serene peak of
this forehead a pair of large gray
eyes, patient and dreamy, being
habitually turned inward upon a mind
toiling with hard abstractions having
within him a conscience burning al­
ways like a planet a bachelorbeing
a logician therefore sweet-tempered,
never having sipped the sour cup of
experience gazing covertly at woman­
kind from behind the delicate veil of
unfamiliarity that lends enchantment
being a bachelor and a book­
worm, therefore already old at
forty, and a little run down
In his toilets, a little frayed out
at the elbows and the knees, a little
seamy along the back, a little deficient
at the heels in pocket poor always,
and always the poorer because of a
spendthrift habit in the matter of
secret charities kneeling down by his
small hard bed every morning and
praying that during the day his logical
faculty might discharge ite function
morally, and that his moral faculty
might discharge its function logically,
and that over all the operations of all
his other faculties he might find
heavenly grace to exercise both a
logical and a moral control at night
kneeling down again to ask forgiveness
that, despite his prayer of the morn­

the most abnormal, shameless, and un­
forseen thus, on the whole, a man shy
and dry, gentle, lovable, timid, reso­
lute, forgetful, remorseful, eccentric,
impulsive, thinking too well of every
human creature but himself an iLlogi­
cal logician, an erring moralist, a wool­
gathering philosopher, but, humanly
speaking, almost a perfect man.
James Lane Allen, in Harper's Maga­
zine.
Wholly Indefeacible.
In southern archipelagos he fought the
bloody cannibal
He skinned and tanned the crocodile and
found him very tannable
Not a word of fear he'd uttered, not a
word and not a syllable,
When he killed the Bengal tiger, and he
found him very killable.
He claimed his strength was very great,
for bears and lions suitable
He used to boot the grizzly bear, and found
him very bootable
He claimed in killing monstrous snakes
that he was very capable,
No boa-constricter could escape, for he was
unescapable.
In fighting hippopotami, he said he was in­
convmcible,
No jaguar could make him wince, because
he wasn't winceable
He made the ramping elephant no longer
recognizable,
And pulverized the roaring bull, and found
him pulverizable.
Just then his wife came in and said, ""I'd
thmk it quite commendable
If you'd come and tend the baby and
you'll find him very tendable.""
The way she took him by the ear will make
this poem readable
She pulled him out and led him home and
found him very loadable.
American Coins.
The gold dollar of the United States
weighs 25.8 grains. The silver dollar
weighs 412 grains. These weights
are based on the assumption that six­
teen pounds of silver are equal in
value to one pound of gold The
smaller silver coins are of less weight
than the dollar in proportionate value,
two half dollars, four quarters or ten
dimes weighing but 384 grains. The
purpose of this difference is obvious.
It is desirable to prevent the exporta­
tion of these subsidiary coins as bullion.
They rre really only counters, and are
legal tender for small amounts only.

Advantages of Plowing Undsr Stubble Instead
of Burning ItHow to Kill the I'cstlf­
erous Bed AntAgricultural
and Household ^tos.
Plow It Under.
The farmer who makes it a rule to
rake up and burn all the trash in the
cultivated fields will usually find that
in a short time the land will become
hard to plow and will require raore
work to get it into a good condition
for planting. Because in burning off
wheat or oat stubble or in raking and
burning the corn stalks, the soil will
seem loose and friable in plowing im­
mediately after, many are led to be­
lieve that burning in this way is bene­
ficial. Just how long the plan of
burning off each year to clean up the
fields can be followed before the effect
will be noticed, depends largely upon
the amount of vegetable matter in the
soil. There is not a very large
amount of manurial value contained
in dry stalks, weeds or trash, so in
plowing them under the effects is
mechanical rather thun chemical. It
is for the e/fect upon the soil rather
than the amount of plant food that
they contain, that they should be
plowed under rather than be burned.
One of the advantages of fall plowing
is that all the trash on the land can
be plowed under, and in doing this
the soil will be keot loose and more
friable. If turned under in the fall
in good season, a large portion of
it will rot during the winter, so that
they will not interfere with the pre­
paration and cultivation of the crops.
With cultivated crops of any kind
trash or coarse manure if on or near
the surface, will interfere consider­
ably with the cultivation and for this
reason they should be turned into the
soil sufficiently early to give them
plenty of time to rot before it is neces­
sary to cultivate, unless cultivation is
so shallow as not to disturb them after
plowing under. Instead of beiDg an
item to clean up and burn all of the
trash possible in order to have clean
land, the better plan is to manage the
plowing as far as possible so as to
turn under in such a manner as to de­
rive the largest amount of benefit
and at the same time interfere the
least in the work necessary with the
crops. When the plan has been fol­
lowed of burning up everything until
the character of the soil has changed,
in many cases it will be advisable to
use straw or stalks as litter iu the
sheds, stables or feed lots and then
haul out and apply to the land, plow­
ing under as soon as possible in order
to supply or put back vegetable mat­
ter, and in this way aid to loosen the
soil. If it cannot be done in the fall,
in many cases it can be done during
the winter and while earlier results
could be secured by applying in the
fall and plowing under, considerable
benefit can be derived if done in the
winter, plowing under whenever the
soil will admit
How to Kill Ants.
Ordinarily in households the red ant
is not a nuisance from the actual loss
whioh it causes by consuming food
products, but from its inordinate
faculty of getting into thingo. It is
attracted by almost everything in the
#house, from sugar to shoe polish, and
from bath sponges to dead cockroaches.
It seems to breed with enormous
fecundity, and the incidental killing
off of a thousand or so has little effect
upon the apparent number. A house
badly infested with these creatures is
almost uninhabitable. They form
their nests in almost any secluded spot,
between the walls, or under the floors,
or behind the base-boards, or among
the trash in some old box or trunk, or
in the lawn or garden walk just outside
the door. In each of these nests sev­
eral females will be found, each laying
her hundreds of eggs, and attended by
a retinue of workers caring for the
larvae, and starting out from dawn till
dark on foraging expeditions in long,
single files, like Indians on the war­
path.
Our first recommendation is to find
the point from which they all come.
They may have built the nest in some
accessible spot, in which case a little
kerosene oil will end a large part, if not
all, of the trouble. If the nest is in
the wall, or under the floor, and tak­
ing up a board will not bring it within
reach, find the nearest accessible point
and devote your energies to killing the
ants off as they appear. Where the
nests are outside nothing is easier than
to find them and to destroy the inhabi­
tants with kerosene or bisulphide of
carbon. The nests are almost always
in the vicinity of the house. Tho ants
are peculiarly susceptible to the action
of pyrethrum in any form, be it Per­
sian or Dalmatian powder or buhnch,
and a free and persistent use of this
powder will accomplish much.Dr. C.
V. RUey.
Better Highways.
One of the things that should be dis­
cussed by farmers' clubs during tho
winter is the topio of better highways.
A lively public interest in good high­
ways must precede any effective ac­
tion. We can not hope for better
highways until we and our neighbors
are thoroughly aroused and enthused.
The man that would better the high­
ways of his neighborhood must begin
by presenting the advantage of better
highways to his neighbors in a con­
vincing way. H^nce, he must study
up the gains of good highways, as
well as how to make them, and pre­
sent the facts to his neighbors and if
there is a good farmers' club in the
neighborhood, it will present the best
opportunities for bringing theso facts
before the neighborhood public.
Household Hints.
To beat the whites of eggs stiff with
ease they should be cold.
Cut a piece from the top of old kid
shoes and insert it inside the ironing
holder you are going to make,
Old paint stains may be removed
from clothing by i*ubbing the spots
with spirits of turpentine, which will
mostly evaporate.
If one wishes to cool a hot dish in a
hurry, it will be found that if the dish
be placed in a vessel full of cold, salty
water it will cool far more rapidly
than if it stood in water free from
salt.
Clean very fine lace with benzine.
'1 set delicate colors in embroider­
ed handkerchiefs, soak them ten min­
uteb before washing in a pail of water
in which a dessertspoonful of turpen­
tine has been stirred.
For earache and toothache, and
neuralgia in head and face, the surest
remedy is a hop poultice wrung from
hot vinegar and against such needs
one should keep on hand a half dozen
flannel bags of convenient size, stuffed
with strong, home-cured hops.
The prejudice prevails that plants
in the sleeping room are injurious,
because they are constantly throwing
off carbonic acid. Recent investiga­
tions have shown that ill effects are
altogether too slight to deserve con­
sideration. If a room is poorly venti­
lated, plants can do no harm, and even
if it is not, tho quantity of carbonic
acid exhaled by them will not- mater-
ially affect the purity of the air.
Agricultural Notes.
Young animals will thrive better if
they are not fed on corn exclusively.
Slice the turnips and sprinkle bran
and oil meal over them before feed­
ing.
Fall pigs need a dry, warm shelter
if they are kept growing during the
winter.
A good colt will hardly come from a
poor mare, even if she is bred to a
good sire.
Where cattle are kept a few head of
sheep can nearly always be kept to an
advantage
In breeding good horses you have
the advantage in always having a
good market for them.
Good care should be given the hens
now as through the winter is the best
time to realize a good profit from
selling eggs.
There is no economy in keeping
stock over winter unless they will
make a sufficient growth to pay well
for their feed.
One advantage in keeping the stock
in a good thrifty condition is that they
are ready to market any time that
may be desirable.
Without protection for every pound
of food giveu to produce growth
another pound must be given to
maintain animal heat
One of the best remedies to use for
worms in stock is to give a little tur­
pentine in their feed, it will relieve
them in a majority of cases.
Care should be taken in handling
young colts to be systematic. Train
them to do one thing at a time, but
have them learn that thoroughly.
To make the best success with farm­
ing, diligence in pushing the farm
work and care in feeding and hand­
ling the stock are very necessary.
Clean water and wholesome food
keep btock in a healthy condition. In
a majority of cases disease results from
filth, unwholesome food, or neglect
By keeping a few rusty nails or old
iron in their drinking water will fur­
nish a good tonic for the poultry, and
especially for the hens when they are
moulting.
Soils that are rich are benefited by
lime as well as soils that are poor. In
the former the lime renders the plant
food soluble. In the latter tbe lime is
itself an addition to the soil as plant
food.
Wood ashes seem dry, but President
Smith, of the Wisconsin Horticultural
Society, snys that his experience is
that iudry seasons there is no fertilizer
that produces better results on potatoes
or strawberries.
Experiments show that when hogs
are given a proportion of ashes and
bone meat they havo larger bone,
grow faster, and produce greater
weight in proportion to food allowed.
Ashes also assists digestion and pro­
motes health.
In general, it is probable, says Pro­
fessor S. W. Johnson, that 99 per cent
and more of tho soil, exclusive of
water, does not in the slightest degree
contribute directly to the support of
the present vegetation of our ordinary
field products.
It is estimated that the surface of an
acre of ground, one foot deep, contains
about 4,000 pounds of phosphoric aold,
8,000 pounds of potash and 16,000
pounds of nitrogen. Much of this,
however, may be beyond the reach of
plants by not being in an available
form.
Skimmed milk is now being recom­
mended for colts. Something depends
on how it is given. Nothing is so in­
jurious as a drink of ioe-cold milk to
a young animal in the winter. To
give milk to calves, colts or pigs is no
doubt an advantage, but it must be
fresh, and warmed before the animals
are allowed to drink it
FAMOUS QOOSE STORY.
How ""Chad'* Got Oat of a Very Clwe an4
Threatening Corner.
Wust scrape I eber got into wid ole

I also apply the word of my text to
those who would like practical comfort.
If any ever escape the struggle of life,
I have not found them. They are not
certainly among the prosperous classes.
In most cases it was a struggle all the way
up till they reached the prosperity, and
since they have reached these heights
there have been perplexities, anxieties
and crises which were almost enough
to shatter the nerves and turn the
brain. It would be hard to tell which
haA-e the biggest fight in this world
the prosperities or the adversities, the
conspicuities or the obscurities. Just
as soon as you have enough success to
attract the attention of others, the en­
vies and jealousies are let loose from
their kennels. The greatest crime that
you can commit in the estimation of
others is to get on better than they do.
They think your addition is their sub­
traction. Five hundred persons start
for a certain goal of success; one
reaches it, and the other four hundred
and ninety-nine are mad. It would
take volumes to hold the story of the
wrongs, outrages and defamations that
have come upon you as a result of your
success. The warm sun of prosperity

brings into life a swamp full of annoy
ing insects.
On the other hand the unfortunate
classes have their struggles for main
tenance. To achieve a livelihood by
one who had nothing to start with, and
after a while for a family as well, and
carry this on until children are reared
and educated and fairly started in the
world, and to do this amid all the
rivalries of business, and the uncer
tainty of crops, and the fickleness of
tariff legislation, with an occasional
labor strike, and here and there a finan
cial panic thrown in, is a mighty tiling
to do, and there are hundreds and
thousands of such heroes and heroines
who live unsung and die unhonored
What we all need, whether up or down
in life or half way between, is the in
finite solace of the Christian religion
And so we employ the word ""Come!""
It will take all eternity to find out the
number of business men who have
been strengthened by the promises
of God, and the people who have
been fed by the ravens when other re­
sources gave out, and the men and
women who, going into this battle
armed only with needle or saw or ax
or yardstick or pen or type or shovel
or shoelast, have gaineJ a victory that
made the heavens resound. With all
the resources of God promised for
every exigency, no one need be left in
the lurch.
A SUBLIME FAITH.
1 like tlie iaitn displayed years ago
in Drury lane, London, in a humble
home where every particle of food had
given out, and a kindly soul entered
with tea and other table supplies, and
found a kettle on the fire ready for the
tea. The benevolent lady said, ''How
is it that you have the kettle ready for
the tea when you had no tea in the
house?"" And the daughter in the
home said, ""Mother would have me
put the kettle on the fire, and when I
said, 'What is the use of doing so, when
we have nothing in the house?' she
said: 'My child, God will provide. Thirty
years he has already provided for me
through all my pain and helplessness,
and he will not leave me to starve at
last. He will send us help though we
do not yet see how.' We have been
waiting all the day for something to
come, but until we saw you we knew
not how it was to come. "" Such things
the world may call coincidences, but I
call them almighty deliverances, and
though you do not hear of them, they
are occurring every hour of every day
and in all parts of Christendom.
But the word ""Come"" applied to
those who need solace will amount to
nothing unless it be uttered by some
one who has experienced that solace.
That spreads the responsibility of giv­
ing this gospel call among a great
many. Those who have lost property
and been consoled by religion in that
trial are the ones to invite those who
have failed in business. Those who
have lost their health and been con­
soled by religion are the ones to invite
those who are in poor health. Those
who have had bereavements and been
consoled in those bereavements are the
ones to sympathize with those who
have lost father or mother or compan­
ion or child or friend. What multi­
tudes of us are alive today, and in good
health and buoyant in this journey of
life, who would have been broken down
or dead long ago but for the sustaining
and cheering help of our holy religion !
So we say ""Come!"" The well is not
dry. The buckets are not empty. The
supply is not exhausted. There is just
as much mercy and condolence and
soothing power in God as before the
first grave was dug, or the first tear
started, or the first heart broken, or
the first accident happened, or the first
fortune vanished. Those of us who
have felt the consolatory power of re­
ligion have a right to speak out of our
own experiences and say ""Come!""
What dismal work of condolence the
world makes when it attempts to eon­
dole! The plaster they spread does
not stick. The broken bones under
their bandage do not knit. A farmer
was lost in the snow storm on a prairie
of the far west. Night coming on, and
after he was almost frantic from not
knowing which way to go, his sleigh
struck the rut of another sleigh, and he
said, ""I will follow this rut, and it will
take me out to safety."" lie hastened
on until he heard the bells of the pre­
ceding horses, but, coming up, he found
that that man was also lost, and, as is
the tendency of those who are thus
confused in the forest or on the moors,
they were both moving in a circle, and
the runner of the one lost sleigh was
following the runner of the other lost
sleigh round and round. At last it oc­
curred to them to look at the north
star, which was peering through the
night, and by the direction of that star
they got home again. Those who fol­
low the advice of this world in time of
perplexity are in a fearful round ; for it
is one bewildered soul following anoth­
er bewildered soul, and only those who
have in such time got their eye on the
morning star of our Christian faith can
find their way out, or be strong enough
to lead others with an all persuasive
invitation.
""But,"" says some one, ""you Chris­
tian people keep telling us to 'come,'
yet you do not tell us how to come.""
That charge shall not be true on this
occasion. Come believing! Come re­
penting! Come praying! After all
that God has been doing for six thou­
sand years, some time through patri­
archs and sometimes through prophets,
and at last through the culmination of
all tragedies on Golgotha, can any one
think that God will not welcome your
coming? Will a father at vast out­
lay construct a mansion for his son,
and lay out parks white with statues
and green with foliage, and all a-sparkle
with fountains, and then not allow his
son to live in the bouse or walk in the
parks? Has God built this house of
gospel mercy, and will he then refuse
entrance to bis children? Will a gov­
ernment at great expense build life
saving stations all along the coast, and
boats that can hover unhurt like a
petrel over the wildest surge, and then
when the lifeboat has reached the
wreck of a ship in the offing not allow j

the drowning to seize the lifeline or
take the boat for the shore in safety!
Shall God provide at the cost of bis
only son's assassination escape for a
sinking world, and then turn a deaf
ear to the cry that comes up from the
breakers ?
THEN TOU HAVE PASSED FROM DEATH
TO LIFE.
""But,"" you say, ""there are so many
things I have to believe, and so many
things in the shape of a creed that I
have to adopt, that I am kept back.""
No, no! You need not believe but
two things namely, that Jesus Christ
came into the world to save sinners,

and that you are one of them. ""But,'
you say, ""I do believe both of these
things!"" Do you really believe them
with all your heart? ""Yes."" Why
then you have passed from death into
life. Why, then you are a son or
daughter of the Lord Almighty. Why,
then you are an heir or an heiress of
an inheritance that will declare divi
dends from now until long after the
stars are dead! Halleluiah! Prince
of God, why do you not come and take
your coronet? Princess of the Lord
Almighty, why do you not mount your
throne? Pass up into the light. Your
boat is anchored, why do you not go
ashore? Just plant your feet hard
down, and you will feel under them the
Rock of Ages.
I challenge the universe for one in
stance in which a man in the right
spirit appealed for the salvation of the
gospel and did not get it. Man
alive! are you going to let all the
years of your life go away with you
without your having this great peace,
this glorious hope, this bright expect­
ancy? Are you going to let the pearl
of great, price he in tne dust at your
feet because you are too indolent or too
proud to stoon down and pick it ui?
Will you wear the chain of evil habit
when near by you is the hammer that
could with one stroke snap the shackle ?
Will you stay in the prison of sin when
here is a gospel key that could unlock
your incarceration? No; no! As the
one word ""Come"" has sometimes
brought many souls to Christ, I will
try the experiment of piling up into a
mountain and then sending down in an
avalanche of power many of these gos
pel ""Comes."" ""Come thou and all","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84022871/1891-01-19/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,vtu_middlebury_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Orleans County monitor.,E.H.

Abbeville Times: There is an enormous
tree la the Ocmulgoe river swamp, near Ab­
beville, that rivals the famous giants of the
California forests. The tree is of the tupelo
gum variety, and towers above the sur­
rounding forest of immense oaka It is evi­
dently of great ago, and doubtless, was in­
habited by the Indians in the prehistoric
age of this country. The tree is hollow at
tte base with an aperture large enough to
admit a tall man. The hollow extends up­
ward for a distance of fifteen feet, affording
space enough for two stories. The hollow
at the base is twelve feet in diameter.

for company. Very likely, too, you may
be poorly paid for your time. I trapped
one whole winter and only caught four
marten by my land trapping. After I
had been at it for a time 1 saw that thero
were no marten in the country, and as I
happened to have i\,o N0.4 ti-;'.;>s with
me, 1 started trapping otter nna caught
thirty-seven during the winter.

Nothing definite can lie said abontthe

some odds and ends by steel traps and

a few dollars in addition to the regular

opportunity on his way down i\n- coast to

iuextion of how many cards to leave:

Wedding Anniversaries.
1'ullowiug is one way in which the list of
wedding anniversaries is enumerated: The
w.joilen wedding is celebrated on the fifth
anniversary of the marriage, the tiu wed­
ding on the tenth, the crystal wedding on
the fifteenth, the linen wedding on the
twentieth, and the silver wedding on the

Useful Hints.
A letter sent by one friend or acqnaint­
fince to another, through the haudt. of u
friend or acquaintance of either or both,
bhould always be unsealed.
Silver or linen given to a bride is mcrked
with the initials of her maiden name.
Temper has been called the ""dims te of
the mind,"" but people who keep others
waiting are the promoters of a blizzard.
Morally speaking, women should not juar­
rel with each other anywhere, but espe­
cially not in crowds. Every one respects a
woman who can smilingly keep her temper.
Olives should be taken from the dish
with a spoon or olive fork and not wit h the
lingers, though they are afterward eaten
by aid of the digits.
Good table manners are founded on hab­

Nr.w YonK, Aug. 9. -The Herald devotes
a page to Chili news this morning, its news
leader being the following dispatch:
Valparaiso. Chili, Aug. sa-Balmaceda's
. ... . . tTJ
power in unui is oroxen. wis
army has been crushed after five
hours hard fighting, and is scat­
tered beyond all hopo of reorganization.
Tbe revolutionists have , taken possession
of Valparaiso, The future of Chili tor the
time has been settled, and settled conclu­
sively on the hills to tbe east of tbo city
to-day by tho grim arbitrament of war.
With Balmaceda practically a fugitive,
without resources in men or money; with
tho principal seaports of the coun­
try in tbo hands of the Con
gressionalists, and a consequent shutting
off all income from customs receipts, with
President-elect Vicuna a refugee on board
a German war-ship and tho country flock­
ing en masse to the standard of the invaders,
it is a matter of only a few days when tho
capital will fall into tbo bands of tho revo­
lutionary loaders.
General Canto and his army won to-day's
battle by superior generalship, good hard
fighting, assisted by good fortuno in tho
killing of Balmaceda's generals, and tho
consequent demoralization of the army and
tho desertion of entire regiments,
Ever sinoe the arrival of the Congression­
alist army at Vina del Mar there has been a
constant series of maneuvers for position
on tbo part of both .generals,
as was indicated in these dispatches.
Every day and nearly every hour of the day
there have been , skirmishes, in ,somo in
stances amounting almost to battles.
In nearly, all of these the oppo­
sition has had tho better of it.
A close censorship of dispatches was estab­
lished by Balmaceda, however, and only an
inkling of tbe reverses to his arms could bo
got through,
tositions or the opposing aumies,
Tho position np to this morning was, m
brief: Balmaceda was not in & position to
make an offensive movement, and devoted
hia time and energies to making his de­
fenses as strong as possible. Then all was not
harmonious in tho military councils of tho
President. Both Generals Barbora and
Alserreea wanted to have supremo com
mand of the forces in tbo fight. This fric­
tion and jealousy resulted in almost an
open rupture yesterday, and tho two of­
ficers worked at cross-purposes.
General Canto waa in no hurry to move on
the enemy because he was receiving con­
stant accessions to his ranks from the
people in the surrounding country, which
is populated largely by those bound, by
ties of blcod or of interest to tbe leaders of
the revolution, many of whom are natives
of tho province. Then ho bad a strongly in­
trenched position and could well a fiord to
wait
Early this worclnt aa"" boom of cannon
announced to the people of Valparaiso
that a movement beyond the ordi­
nary skirmishes had begun. Tbo occasional
loud reports of tbo heavy guns soon
swelled into one continuous roar, and then
it was known that the iinal decisive strug­
gle, which, at the cost of thousands of
lives, perhaps, was to decide whether Bal­
maceda or the junta was to bo the ruling
power in Chili, had begun.
General Canto's position was on the hills
above the race-track at Vina del Mar,
outside of tbe city. Hia raiders
have boon getting bolder and bolder as
the time passed and have been making
excursions further in tbe country. He had
absolute control of the railroad to Santiago
and commanded tho ordinary roads. Hence
Santiago was practically in a state of
siege.
Affairs had come to such a pass that it
was necessary for President Balmaceda to
make some move, and a littlo after
daylight this morning the word was
given to attaok tho position held by
the revolutionists, and. led by Generals Bar­
bosa and Alzerreca. tbo government troops
left their breastworks and advanced on the
enemy nnder cover of a hoavy fire from
their batteries. As soon as the approaehing
column got within range of tbe rifles
of the insurgents a destructive fire was
opened by the intrenohed revolutionists.
THF. TIRE WAS TOO HOT.
Tho government troops advanced with
much steadiuess to tho attack. They
were soon near enough to do
effective work with their pieces, and
the engagement became general. Shot
and shell, grape and cannister, and rifle
bullets tore through the rsnks of tbe ad­
vancing troops nntil it became too hot, and
despite the efforts of the officers they
broke and retired almost in a panic
Officers worked like beavers to reform their
columns as soon as they got without the
danger of the deadly insurgent fire, and at
last succeeded.
Then came another attack. In steady
ranks tho government troops started on a
double-quick up into the torrent of
fire and lead, which blazed from
the ranks of -the insurgent army,
Early in the aecocd charge General Barbosa
was shot down and killed. Tho line wa
vered, but kept on. Then General Alzer
reca fell from his horse wounded nnto
death. He was removed from tne fiela and
died within an hour.
Another break and then General Canto
gave tho order to charge With a wild yell
the Congressionalist army left their de
fenses and charged on the retreat-
ing army, ineir artillery poured a
deadly fire into the ranks of Balmaceda's
army. The loss of their generals left them
without a head, and all the efforts of the
subordinate officers to rally them to meet
the onset of Canto's regiments and squad
rons were of no avail. The retreat became
a rout, the rout a panic, and then came
utter demoralization.
The government cavalry made a stand
but it was short. They were literally cut
to pieces.

In its November number the Cos­
mopolitan will publish a series of
letters written by Gen. W. T. Sher­
man to one of his young daughters,
between the years 1859 aud 1865
and covering most of the important
events of the war of secession. These
letters present graphic pictures of a
great soldier amid some of the stir­
ring scenes in which he was a giant
figure, and in them the patriotic
spirit of the Federal general is seen
to have been most attractively tem­
pered by a strong affection for the
Southern people. The fraternal
feeling which glows in these letters
is in refreshing contrast to the sec­
tional bitterness which characterized
the period, and they will constitute
an interesting and important contri
bution to the literature of the war.

A telegraph operator on one of the single
track roads leading out of Pittsburg had au
experience last week that will last him a
life-time. The young man become careless,
as dispatchers sometimes will, and he gave
orders for a freight and passenger train,
moving in opposite directions, to go to a
certain station. When the trains had
started, the operator suddenly remembered
that they couldn't reach the place without
a collision. It was too late to countermand
the order, and in his agony cold drops of
pcrsriiration ran down over"" his face. In de­
scribing his feelings afterward, he
said he lived years in the few
short minutes which would decide the
fate of the trains. He was' startled and re.
lieved by seeing the engineer of the freight
walk, into the tower. The engineer had re­
ceived his orders, but when he reached a
switch he had a premonition there was
f oraething wrong, and he turned in on the
side track. His train was scarcely out of
the way when the express thundered by.
The next dav the operator went to the
superintendent of the road, and told him
what had happened, at the same time hand­
ing in his resignation. The manager looked
at him for a moment, and then said: ""Go
back to your work, my boy. This experi­
ence has been a lesson for you. I don't
think it will occur in the future.""
The telegrapher, in telling the story, re­
marked that another such fright would drive
him crazy. He added that this is only a
sample of what narrow escapes people have
on railroads. ""There is something in luck,
but few understand how intelligent train
men often avert disasters.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024546/1891-11-15/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,pst_eisenhower_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Pittsburg dispatch.,"Rook, O'Neil & Co.",Pittsburg [Pa.],"","",868,20688,2632,5156,3,23832,29260,4,pst_eisenhower_ver01/data/sn84024546/00237282073/1891111501/0178.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pittsburgh,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/pst_eisenhower_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84024546%2F00237282073%2F1891111501%2F0178.jp2/pct:3.642162,70.704033,11.043974,17.621326/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/pst_eisenhower_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84024546%2F00237282073%2F1891111501%2F0178.jp2/pct:3.642162,70.704033,11.043974,17.621326/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

THE PRAISE OF YAWNING.
A Model I'liyslrnt Ixcrclso AVIilcli fillnin­
lutes unit liciresliei the Whole lloily.
To yawn is to do a good deal moro than
merely ""to open wide tho mouth through
drowsiness or weariness,"" as tho diction­
aries tells us. According to Mrs. Husscll,
of Delsnrtean fame, tho yawn is an invol­
untary exercise which nature suggests to
us when, ilLCoiisequenco of sleep or drowsi­
ness or ennui nr cold or hunger or indiges­
tion, something is needed to restoro the
system to a stnto of general activity.
Through it and the movements which ac­
company it the hole body, beginning with
tho muscles of the throat and face, is stim­
ulated and rcfrnhed, the successUo mo­
tions extending , hemsclves throughout tho
cntlro frnmo and reaching finally to tho
feet. ""A good awn,"" says Mrs. Huvsell,
""is always slow, and tho best uses every
articulation In tho body probably every
muscle- possibl j , n freshes every nerve.
Not all at once or in jerks, but slowly, in
perfect successions or rhythms, with the
best possible breathing. Certainly no gym­
nast, with the single exception of Francois
Deisarte, over so arranged tho samo ex­
penditure of force, nervous and muscular,
ns to result In an equal amount of invigor­
ating effect upon tho system."" And again
wo nro Informed that yawning ""embodies
all tho laws of growth needed for move­
ments that are t.igivo physic al growth and
refreshment, nnd soma of the laws which
aro necessary to tho higher growth, bo
called, of the motions nml tho intellect.""
Tho moral of theso observations would
appear to bo that wo ought all to yawn as
much as possible tho oftcner thu better;
and further, suite yawning comes so ne.ir
perfection as a modo of bodllj exercic,
that we should d well to discard such con­
ventionalities ns dumb bells and the hori­
zontal bar, and to cttltlvato our bodily
powers by merely lounging in our chairs
and yawning. Men ly to think about it or
to rend about it is t nougli to set somo peo

desired result can bo attained in a purely

In hygienic matters tho Japanese liav e

Tho Lancet. In their nightly bath and
morning wash the water is never cold,
never worm, hut always hot as it can bo

unci suppleness of tho skin, nnd by persons
inclined to rheumatism Is boon found to bo
altogether preferable to tho cold hath iu
every particular. Tho poorest of the Jap­
anese hear of n cold bath with amazement,
and would bo sure tho man who used it

""Talking shop"" may, lo a great extent,

To render it n selfish amusement it is

In Mindinac, the farthest southeastern
island in the Philippine group, upon one of
its mountains, the volcanic Apo, a party of
botanical and ethnographical explorers
found recently, at a height of 2,500 feet
above the sea level, a colossal flower. The
discoverer. Dr. Alexander Schadenberg,
could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw
amid the low-growing bushes the immense
buds of this flower growing like gigantic
cabbage heads. But he was still more aston­
ished when he found a specimen in lull
bloom, a five-petaled flower nearly a yard
in diameter, as large as a carriage-wheel, in
fact.
This enormous blossom was borne on a
sort of vine creeping on the ground. The
native, who accompanied Dr. Schadenberg,
called it ""bolo."" The party had no scale
by which the weight of the flower could be
ascertained, but they improvised a swing­
ing scale, using their boxes and specimens
as weights. Weighing these when opportu­
nity served, it was found that a single
flower weighed over 22 pounds. It was im­
possible to transport the fresh flower, so the
travelers photographed it, and dried a num­
ber of its leaves by the heat of a fire.

ffuld hardly be torn from his father, and
husband told me that long after the
hdd s shriek of utter misery, unoblldlike in
intensity, rang in his ears. For some
V"" after the command had marched across
.helow purple hills, out of the reach of lov­
-1 l .res Buster drooped and pined; but he
was child, and the old ohildish gayety
De back to his eyes, and his laugh, which
, out as happily as ever, almost jarring
~noa his young mother’s ear.
One warm June day at Fort Lincoln Mrs.
Wank sat sewing in her tiny parlor, her
habv creeping about the floor at her feet,
while she chatted with two or three more
lonely wives, perhaps of the belovod ones
far off across the plains and their possible
return. Suddenly Buster rushed in through
the open door, eyes sparkling, hair flying.
“jjamma,” he shouted, ""my papa’s s’oot­
ice his ’volver! I heard him!”
‘ Did you darling!” his young mother
paid stooping to kiss the little flushed, eager
f ee' “How very nice! I wish he could
cone home and s’oot it. Don’t you!”
• He’s s’ooting Indians,” the child went on;
“and he’ll s’oot ’em all, and zen he’ll tome
fcC“lm sure I hope he will,” sighed Mrs.
Blank. ""Run out and play, Buster, and
don’t go in the sun.”
■ How Buster does talk about his father!”
pome one remarked. “I often meet him
ruining along with someone, and, child or
mao soldier or officer, you can always catch
the words ’my papa’ if you listen to him.”
Then the talk wandered on, always in a
minor key. for there had been quite an in­
terval of time since the last letters, and
tc=re was always unacknowledged anxiety,
though all felt unbounded faith in the pow­
ers of the gallant Seventh.
Presently the sound of a child’s bitter ory­
j g brought them all to their feet, and
Buster ran into bis mother’s arms at the
door sobbing wildly:
Mamma,” he sobbed, “the Injuns has
dot my papa. He’s dot no more s’oots in
his Volver; ha’s s’ooted it all. O, I want
mv papa, and the bad Injuns has dot him!”
Mrs. Blank knelt down on the floor be­
tide her boy, drawing him close to her
heart.
• Hush, Buster.” she said, very gently,
but tirmlv, “you must not be such a silly
little boy the Injuns can’t get your papa.
f,eo. Custer is there; he will take care of
papa and all the men. Do you think F
troop would let the Injuns get papa? See,
you are making us all feel very bad, and
ja:a would say that you were not his brave
little lad. Now stop crying and go and
play; you could not hear papa’s ’volver so
far away.”
“Yes.” the child exclaimed, earnestly, ""I
tan hear my papa’s ’volver. and I know he’s
sooted it all!” But army discipline pre­
vailed, and the boy choked back his sobs,
nestling in his mother’s arms, and resting
there, strangely quiet, for the rest of the
long summer day.
That evening, when the children were
both sleeping, and the daily bulletin to her
absent husband had been written, Mrs.
Blank sat for some moments in silent
thought, then drawing a sheet of paper to
her, wrote down the date June 2t5, and
poured out to her only brother the aching
of her heart and the senseless anxiety caused
by the child’s foolish words, the memory of
which still stirred him in his sleep, for he
sobbed and tossed all nigbt.
On July 6, when the whole army
writhed and cried out in agony at the news
that had come to us, we, to whom Mr. B.
tad shown his sister’s letter, know that on
Ju.-.s 2ti Capt. Blank had dearly
sold his life, and had been found pierced
wth many wounds, his empty revolver
clasped in bis stiffened hand. And far
sway, in his quiet home, his baby boy had
teemed to know it.

pers of a notary in Paris several highly
interesting documents relating to the
affairs of the poet Racine. Among
them, says the Paris correspondent of
the London Telegraph, axe his certificate
of marriage and the inventory of his
property and of his library. It is hoped
that a careful examination of these pa­
pers will set at rest a long standing dis­
pute as to which of two houses that
both claim the distinction was the scene
of Racine’3 death. The documents com­
pletely refute the prevailing idea that
Racine died poor, as among them is an
acknowledgment of a debt of 20,000
francs from a prince. Curiously enough,
the inventory of the library shows that
at the time of hi3 death Racine did not
possses a single copy of any of his own

wuias.
Female Liberty in Africa.
Woman suffrage in Wyoming isn’t a
circumstance to the liberty of the gentler
sex in some parts of Africa. In the
oasis of Ghardaia, in the great desert of
Sahara, the women whon they marry
draw np their own marriage contract,
and if the man in any way breaks it the
woman is immediately free and will
have no more to say to him. The Ghar­
daians are Mohammedans, and by the
law of the prophet a man may have four
wives. The women, however, do not
allow more than one, and polygamy is
practically banished. They have also a
peculiar objection to drinking and
smoking, and in many contracts the
husband is told that if he falls into the
habit of “consuming liquors or using
tobacco” he will be divorced.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016025/1892-05-30/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,me_graftonnotch_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Portland daily press.,N.A.

Sacramento, May 31.—About 11 o'clock
to-night a highbinders' war broke out in the
Chinese quarter, not 50 yards from J street.
There have been several outbreaks of late,
but they have resulted only in the occasional
wounding of some Chinaman. )
To-night, however,' grim war came in
earnest, and for half a minute there was a
perfect fusilade on Third street in front of
one highbinders' den, and another on J
street in front of.the headquarters of an­
other society. Shots were exchanged
across the street tn rapid succession, like
the rattle of musketry during a battle—
which, in fact, It was, though on a small
scale. For a while perfect sheets of flame
shot from each side of the street aud the air
was full of flying bullets.

An electric car with a number of people
ou board happened to be on the track right
between the contending hosts, and a per­
fect storm of bullets whistled through the
open car and about the heads of the passen­
gers, who climbed out of the way as best
they could. The conductors and cripmen
put on their brakes and likewise abandoned
their posts in hot haste.
When the smoke of the battle cleared
away two dead -Chinamen were found and
one who bad been shot through the thigh.
How many others were wounded and got
away is not known and it may be that more
were killed and their bodies hidden by
comrades. One gang did its shooting from
a balcony and the other from the sidewalk.
One man, a peaceable Icigarmaker, who
has a wife and two little girls, was shot
while In his own place of business and died
while in the arms of his wife.

It was a pitiful sight to see the little girls
wringing their hands over their father's
dead body, while the wife's lamentations
were not Jess touching than would be those
of any white woman uuder similar tragic
circumstances.
The police have arrested seven China­
men, all of whom were armed with big
pistols, and several of these weapons had
recently been discharged.

effort* to prevent or restrain them. Neither
do they now promise us any substantial re­
form. They have agreed together to ignore
in the coining campaign every is^ue but one.

They propose to drown the outcries of a
plundered people with the uproar of a sham
battle over tbe tariff, so that capitalists, cor­
porations, national banks, rings, trust*,
watered *tock, the demonetization of silver,
and the oppression of the usurer* may all be
lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our
homes, wives and children on the altar of
mammon, to destroy the multitude in order to
eecure corruption funds from the miilioaaires.
Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday
of the nation and filled with the spirit of the
grand generation who established our inde­
pendence, we seek our independence, we seek
to restore the L-overnment of the republic to
the bands of ""the plain people,"" with whose
class it originated. We assert our purposes to
be identical with the purposes of the national
constitution: ""To form a more perfect union
establish justice, secure domestic tranquility,
provide for the common defense, promote the
general welfare and wcure the blessing* of
liberty for ourselves and our posterity."" We
declare that this republic can only endure as a
free government, while built upon the love of
the whole people for each other and for the
nation, that it cannot be pinned together by
bayonet-, that the civil war is over and that
every tssion aud resentment which grew out
of it must die with it, and that we must lie in
fact as we are in name, one united brother­
hood of free men. Our country finds itself
confronted by conditions for which there is no
precedent in the history of the world. Our
annual agricultural productions amount to
billions of dollar* in value, which must within
a few weeks or months be exchanged for bil­
lions of dollars worth of commodities con­
sumed in their production. The exhausting
currency supply iaj whollv inadequate to
make the exchange. The result* are
falling prices, the formation of com­
bines and ringa,S and the impoverish­
ment. of the producing class. We pledge
ourselves that if given power we will labor to
oorrect these evils by wise and reasonable leg­
islation in accordance with the tenet* of our
platform. We believe that the powers of gov­
ernment, in other words, of the p-ople, shall
be extended (as in tie case of the postal serv­
ice) as rapidly and as far as the good sense of
an intelligent: people and the teachings of ex­
perience shall justify, to the end that oppres­
sion in justice and poverty shall eventually
cease in the land.

While our sympathies, apart from reform,
are naturally upou the side of every proposi­
tion which will ten 1 to make men intelligent,
virtuous and temperate, we nevertheless re­
gard these questions* important as tu«y are,
as aub.»'.

ing for solution, and upon which not only
one's Individual prosperity but the very exist­
ent e of free institutions depvtuls. aud we a»k

Two Stage Robbers Taken From Jail and
Lynched.
EEDDING, Cal., July 25.—John D. and
Charles Ruggles, the two brothers who
robbed the Redding stage near here several
weeks ago, killed Express Messenger Mont­
gomery and wound. the driver and a pas­
senger, were taken Irom jail by about lorty
masked men at 2:30 this morning and
hanged. The recent sentimental attitude
of a number of women towards the pris­
oners, as well as the line of delense
adopted by their counsel, who has .been
evidently endeavoring to implicate Mes­
senger Montgomery as. a party to the crime,
had been denounced by a number of per­
sons in the county, and it is believed that
the lynching' was due to these causes.
About 1 o'clock this morning the body of
armed men, who had evidently rendez­
voused some distance from the town,
marched through a quiet street to the court
house. The sheriff and deputy were asleep
at home, but the men aroused the jailer,
compelled him to accompany them to the
sheriff's office and forced him to divulge
the tact that the keys ot the jail were in the
sheriff's safe. The men then spent nearly
an hour in opening the safe.

Finally they secured the keys and went
to that part of the building occupied as the
jail. The cells of the two men were opened
and the older one. John Ruggles, asked the
crowd to be lenient to his brother, saying
he was innocent. The brothers were hand­
cuffed and their hands tied behiiftl their
backs and re jjptl Irom the ja1!. The
party walked' several blocks and stopped
where a ross-oeaiii was suspended irom
two pine trees, he ends oi the ropes
which had been placed around the necks of
the two men were thrown across a beam
and the men were told they could make a
statement. The brothers had but little to
say, though John still persisted that the
younger one was innocent. In another mo­

STURM '
This Has No Uncertain Sound
Mat Does This Mean To Our
People?
It Rings With a Great and
Grand Hope, i
Something Thousands
Are Seeking For.
A Fact of Marvellous Import to
All.
Nkwburg, N. Y.—A telegraphic dispatch
from Newburg, N. Y„ reveals the fact that a
most marvellous change has taken place in the
person of one of its oldest and best known citi­
zens. H. S. Shorter, Esq., is an old man ot 75
years, and lives at 391 Broadway, Newburgj
N. Y. It appears that Mr. Shorter, who was
an extensive lumber dealer, began to grow lan­
guid, got tired easily, was nervous and debili­
tated, until at last he became so weak and ex­
hausted that he was just able to drag himself
around. He lost flesh and strength so rapidly
and became so alarmingly prostrated that his
friends and relatives despaired of his life.
Now came the marvellous change.
Suddenly Mr. Shorter was transformed from
his condition of extreme weakness to one of
strength; his nerves grew quickly strong and
steady, his muscles became vigorous, his blood
was revivified and enriched, he gained 15
pound in weight, and today is in sound and per­

xcub ucaibu.
Such a remarkable transformation in a man
of his age was a nine days’ wonder.
Of course the cause was eagerly looked for.
Your correspondent, determined to know the
truth for the paper’s readers listened to the
following astonishing facts from Mr. Shorter’s
own lips:
“I feel now like a new man !
“What do you think of taking an old man of
75 years, physically weak and broken down,
and mating him feel like a boy again/ Giving
him new life, health and strength, and adding
15 pounds of solid flesh to his weak and debili­
tated frame!
“And all in two months, with three bottles
of Dr. Greene’s Nervura blood and nerve reme­
dy! Well, that is just wl<at has taken place in
me. Instead of being weak, debilitated and ex­
hausted, just able to drag myself around, I feel
now like a new man!
“I advise all to use Dr. Greene’s Nervura
blood and nerve remedy !”
Surely this wonderful remedy is a most
marvellous health restored, and, without doubt,
the greatest medical discovery of the age.
If it can thus give back health and strength
to an old man, weakened and exhausted by
disease, how much more s'urely and certainly
will it cure the thousands who are run down,
weak, neruous and prostrated, who suffer from
poor blood, weak nerves, dyspepsia, indiges­
tion, constipation, malaria, kidney and liver
complaints, etc. For debility it is a speedy re­
storer of strength and vigor. If you are run
down in health and need a medicine to
strengthen the nerves, invigorate the blood,
tone up the stomach and regulate the bowels,
kidneys and liver, Dr. Greene’s Nervura blood
and nerve remedy, which is purely vegetable
and harmless, and is the best remedy known
in the world.
Use it, for it will retore your health and
strength. You can get it at any druggist for
$1.
It is the discovery and prescription of the
well-known and successful physician, Dr.
Greene of 34 Temple PI., Boston, Mass., the
eminent specialist in the cure of nervous and
chronic diseases, who can be consulted free,
personally or by letter.

E. B. Tamer, in considering the
Dr.
question whether youns: children between
the ages say ol 6 and 12, should be allowed
to cycle, and, Jf allowed, how much they
may indulge in the pastime without in­
curring the risk of injury, maintains that
tne subject is one on which no man can pro­
nounce dogmatically or lay down strict and
invariable rnles concerning. AVhat for one
small boy or cirl might be merely healthy
and beneficial exercise, for another might
mean physical rnin. But while each case
must be judged on its own merits, one
fundamental principle must be clearly
enunciated, namely, that no young child
with any organic weakness, whether of
heart, Jungs, joints or nervous system,
should be allowed to mount a machine
under any circumstances whatever.
Setting aside such natural disonalinca-
tions, the exercise of cycling, promptly
rrgniated and adjusted to the capabilities
ot the individual, is unquestionably one of
the best forms of recreation that can be
partaken of by children of both sexes at an
early age. It develops the body, and the
self-reliance and resource entailed by the
management of a maehine tend to
strengthen and enlarge the mental and in-',
tellectual faculties. A few simple precau­
tions, however, may insure good and avert
evil results. As to the age that a child
should begin: JJor most children six is
quite early, and even for some six is too
early. Great care should be taken in
choosing and fitting a machine to a young
rider; an old, ill-fitting crock may produce
deformity or disease. The machine should
be light, of course, the","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024546/1892-11-06/ed-1/seq-14,"","",14,"","",1,pst_eisenhower_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Pittsburg dispatch.,"Rook, O'Neil & Co.",Pittsburg [Pa.],"","",14304,3568,2656,5804,14,23240,28604,4,pst_eisenhower_ver01/data/sn84024546/0023728222A/1892110601/0079.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pittsburgh,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/pst_eisenhower_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84024546%2F0023728222A%2F1892110601%2F0079.jp2/pct:61.549053,12.473780,11.428571,20.290868/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/pst_eisenhower_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84024546%2F0023728222A%2F1892110601%2F0079.jp2/pct:61.549053,12.473780,11.428571,20.290868/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Washington, Nov. 23. Mr. Catch­
ings, a leading member of the House
Committee on Rules, is now in Washing­
ton. He is quoted in nn interview as
expressing the belief tlnit the present
Congress will do nothing to lessen the
burdens of the incoming administration
and that the new Congress will Ik: com
pelled to take necessary steps to increase
the revenues. He does not believe that a
revision of the tariff can be successfully
undertaken during the special session,
but he docs hold that in e special session
the new Congress might iopcrly repeal
the McKinley act, thus restoring the
duties of 1883. That would wipe out
the sugar bounties, effecting a saving of
$13,000,000 anuually, and, at the same
time, bv restoring the sugar duties udd
about $50,000,000 to the annual reve­
nues making the total increase of reve
nues approximate $05,000,000.
This increase, Catchings feels, would
prevent any deficiency until after the
next regular session and possibly for a
longer period.
Catchings would nlso pass tbe sepa
rate tariff bills that were passed last
session by the House only to remain un­
acted upon by the Senate, and he would
also add lumber and salt to tbe free list.
The reduced prices of the necessaries of
lile secured by the repeal of the McKin­
ley bill would, according to bis reason­
ing, reconcile the people to the reimposi­
tion of tbe sugar duties.
He tavors an early siiecial session of
Congresa; thinks that Crisp will be re
elected speaker without a protracted
struggle, and believes that the pension
roll could be revised with profit.
Catchings says there is no danger ol
wild cat moncv"" in the passage of a
bill to removethe tax on State banks' cir­
culation, and he favors that bill if States
are obliged to insure these banks of
issues.
lie also favors the admission, as
States, Arizona and New Mexico, and
local government for Utah and Okla
homa. So far as this Congress is con
cerned be thought it would do no more
than pass the regular annual appropri­
ation bills.

method. This base is soda, the predomi­
nating base of sea salt, where it is com­
bined with hydrochloric acid. Not only
is soda the most soluble of all the mineral
bases, but the miueral acid with which
it is combined forms a remarkably solu­
ble series of salts—the chlorides. Thus
the primary fact coucerning the salinity
of sea water is that it has selected from
among the stable chemical elements the
two which form the most soluble com­
pounds; Among the earthy bases is one
which is exceptionally soluble—that is.
magnesia—and this stands next to soda
in its abundance in sea water.
Modern research has shown that the
ocean contains in solution nearly every
element that exists upon the earth, and
that these elements exist in the water in
pro’K>rtions nearly corresponding to the
mean solubility of their various com­
pounds. Thus gold and silver and most
of the other heavy metals exist there.
Sonnenstadt found abont fourteen
grains of gold to the ton of seawater, or
a dollar's worth in less than two tons.
As the ocean covers all the lower valleys
of the earth, it receives all the drainage
from the whole of the exposed land.
This drainage is the rainwater that has
'fallen upon this exposed surface, has
flowed down its superficial slopes or has
sunk into porous land and descended
underground. In either case the water
must dissolve and carry with it any sol­
uble matter that it meets, the quantity
of solid matter which is thus appropri­
ated being projtortionafce to its solubility
and the extent of its exposure to the
solvent, [lain when it falls upon the
earth is distilled water, nearly pure (its
small impurities being what it obtains
from the air), but river water when it
reaches the ocean contains measurable
quantities of dissolved mineral and veg­
etable matter. These small contribu­
tions are ever pouring in and ever accu­
mulating. This continual addition of
dissolved mineral salts without any cor­
responding abstraction by evaporation

tion of fire is ascribed to the spite of a
cunning demon.
""Is it quite certain,"" asks M. Renan,
""that the ancients regarded the doom of
the inventive Titan as undeserved? If
a debating club of scholars should dis­
cuss the question whether fire has, on
the whole, been a benefit to the human
ra-ce it might surprise the audience how
strong a case could be made out on the
negative side.""
The progress of civilization is of course
inseparable from the use of fire. But
the problem whether the phenomenon
of combustion, in its various manifesta­
tions, has been a blessing rather than a
curse is a very different question, and
might be impartially answered as to
the interest of individuals and single
centuries, yes; as to mankind and the
result of a series of centuries, no. San

In wliieh they lay etnnei, and upon which they

then carefully rei love the coals: rutling a num­
ber of sapling th -y dick one end In the erounri,
bend them over and place the other end also la
the ground, these extend over the hot stones la
the nhape or a r,lf loop. Over these polea or
hoops the India n place skins of animals or
blankets. If the Russian"" or vapor bath Is de­
sired, they then throw wnter upon tha hot rocks,
thus generating steam. Those Ueslrina; the vapor

akin are opened a id thev profuselv perspire tbey
crawl out and an ther Indian dashes buckets of
cold water over tl em. or they plunge Into a nenr

with Klckapoo In Han Oil, and are given copious
drafts of Kickaroo Indian Sagwa; after which
they roll up la hl .nkels and bare a sound sleep.
Who can teich the Indians anything
about health? His own physique answers
for his superior knowledge.

A Newspaper Man's Careful and
Complete Investigations.
WHAT TWO MINISTERS v SAID.
A Searching; luquiry us to Mr*. Hen­
derson'* Pirn «Ud Present Condition,
and the Result* Which Were Ob­
tained.
A few days since there was pub
Itshed in this paper one of the most re­
markable letters ever written by any
woman. Some of the statements made
and facts It contained were so unusual
and the Interest, not to say excitement,
occasioned was so great, that an invest!
Ration for the benefit of the public
seemed a necessity. In the pursuit of
such investigation I visited Port Chester,
N. Y., and at the hotel, on the street,
and in the stores, I heard a great deal
of talk on the very subject I was inves­
tigating. Rev. Ernest L Scott, after I
bad explained what 1 wished, said:
""Nearly a year ago I first met Mrs. J.
Henderson, who resides at No. 315
Westchester avenue. I called to .. see
her in company with Hon. Addison John
son, and must confess that I have
seldom seen any one in so deplorable a
condition. My first view almost uu
nerved me, she was so weak, her nerves
so unstrung, and with the most danger­
ous dropsical condition. She told
how she had suffered, how her sister had
come to prepare the house for her
expected funeral,' and she continued,
'words cannot tell the story of my suf
ferings. ' 1 withdrew from the house
feeling that it was the last time I should
evèr see her alive.
""The next time I saw Mrs. Henderson
was early In the present year. I could
hardly believe what I saw. She was
well, healthy, had no trace of the drops)
cal trouble ; indeed, she seemed to be in
perfect health. Naturally 1 was
amazed and asked her the cause. She
'said, with tears streaming from her
eyes: T owe it all to that grand remedy,
Warner's Safe Cure'. Her husband spoke
up at once a-d said, 'yes, that is the
secret of my wife's recovery aud after 1
have seen what the Safe Cure has done
for my wife, 1 am confident that it will
relieve any case of Bright's""disease and
cure any one whose constitution Is not
wasted away.""
n .­

Rev. Samuel O. Curtice, pastor of the
Methodist Church at Port Chester, said
to me; ""Yes, I know all about Mrs
Henderson's troubles, which were caused
by a bad case of Bright's disease. She
had been given up and I was called In to
baptise her. Instead of that I talked
and prayed with her and then withdrew.
1 called again the next day and per­
formed the ceremony. Her rapid re­
covery to her present state of health and
strength is really wonderful.""
Hon. Addisuu Johnson, member of the
Board of Supervisors, aud their delegate
to the Aisembly at Albany, said : ""I have
known all about Mrs. Henderson's case.
Her death was expected daily for a long
time. She was the sickest person I ever
saw that lived. Certainly any remedy
that could perform such wonders must
be a marvelous one,""

The conclusions from my investiga­
tions are these, namely ; that one of the
most remarkable cures on record has
been accomplished in Port Chester. It
is that of a lady who, when taken ill
""went from bad to worse,"" until brought
to death's door by the worst of all
known dheases, and yet is to day well
and happy. The experience of Mrs.
Henderson should prove a valuable one
to all readers who may be treading the
same dangerous path, viz: treating
symptoms instead of what causes them,
aud not realizing their great danger
until in many cases too late for human
aid.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042354/1893-03-25/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,deu_arden_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Evening journal.,J.

Where Green-Backs are Redeemed.
With a ""pass"" from the Treasurer
we may walk through the Redemption
Division, as it is called, where the
worn-out bank bills are received and
cancelled and destroyed. You would
be amazed to see the skill with which
fragments of bills that have been
soaked in water nearly to a pulp,
scorched and crisped by fire, or gnawed
by rats, are pieced together on paper
the size of the original bill, so that
their value can be found. When all
is done, they are placed under a glass,
which is also of the same size as the
bill, and is divided into sections that
will show very nearly the precise frac­
tional part of the bill which is missing,
so that if a tenth part of a one-dollar
bill is gone, the bill is at once seen to
be worth but ninety cents. The wom­
en do this with surprising accuracy
and dexterity. It is not always pleas­
ant work, for the money is sometimes
fearful stuff to handle when it comes
in to be counted reeking with filth,
and having a shocking odor. That
which is to be destroyed or replaced
with new is put on a machine run by a
turbine wheel, which punches the pack­
ages in several spots so that it would
be nearly impossible to use the bills
again, and it is then taken to a pecu­
liar furnace to be burned, where the
coloring matter, chemical and metallic,
of its substance makes a curious vividly
tinted slag. Harriet","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83032011/1893-04-07/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,pst_irvin_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Columbian.,George H.

that was more like a feverish dream

“And yet those who fell at that time
are the happy dead,"" said Walter, the
young student, leaning forward and
speaking with suppressed enthusiasm.
“It is a graud thing to die for one's
country.""
""It is equally grand to live for one's
country bravely, loyally and worthily,""
replied the veteran. ""I sometimes feel
that the strongest purpose of my life,
now. is to impress that sentiment upon
the rising generation.”
“Mrs. Col. Copley is always talking
in that way."" said Walter's sister
Helen. “She is standing in the lot
just across the driveway—just look,
uncle. Issho not lovely?’’
“She is still handsome, but at eight­
een she was exceedingly beautiful."" re­
plied the gentleman, glancing across
the drive to a substantial granite mon­
ument. where, against the background
of a huge, thickly mussed evergreen
tree, stood a woman of fifty in widow’s
weeds placing a pillow of Ktiglish vio­

“Col. Silas Copley.""

nel's wife. He was only a lieutenant
then, poor fellow! The marriage was
one of the romances of the war.""
""Oh, uncle, tell us about it!"" cried
May, and the request was repeated
with acclamation by all the party.
So, in tin* intervals of music and
speech-making and greeting passing
acquaintances, this story was told with
the beautiful heroine in full view, sit­
ting in an iron arm-chair within the
shadow of the monument, and with a
look on her face as if she were holding
communion with the silent sleeper be­
low.
""I love to look at her."" said little
May. ""1 have often seen her here. She
lives in a handsome resilience over on
the avenue. I have been told that she
comes every day, ami 1 know there are
always bright flags and fresh white
flowers abotit the monument, almost
always white violets.""
“They were his favorite flower,"" said
the veteran. “The casket was lined
with them when ho was buried. Their
fragratiee always had power to calm
the violence of her grief. She said they
seemed to bring him near, and she could
believe that he was beside her, though
invisible.""
“When did you meet hpr first, uncle?""
reminded bertha, as the band rested at
the farthest gate, and the children flit­
ted hither and thither with their flow­
ers.
""It was in 'rtl. 1 had just received
my commission as chaplain of the
Twenty-third. I was full of Christian
enthusiasm and -patriotic zeal, as I left
; home to join my regiment at the front.
“The railway train was crowded. It
seems to me now. as 1 look haek. that
trains were always crowded in war
time, and that there wen* always
bright-fared young fellows in blue uni­
forms, of which they seemed very
proud. Often these l>oys in blue wore
or carried flowers, and, if there chanced
to be one not thus adorned, there was
always at hand a sweet young girl
wit’, a nosegay with which she was
only too happy to favor him. That
day f remember I had my seat to my­
self for some distance, ant' then at a
bustling station the most beautiful
young girl 1 had ever seen entered the
ear. and as there wa* no viwint seat I
offered her the place by my side, which
she graciously nr rpted.
""Although sh-* did not, as I expected
she Would, proffer me the Isuiquet of

long about falling into conversation,
and soon she was duly informed re­
garding my rank, name, nativity and

“ Oh. no. no. I am single.*
•••I didn't mean that. Hare you ever
performed the marriage ceremony?*
‘•'Some score or more of times.*

one portion, fastened another to her

to her own corsage.
“ ‘We will have a violet wedding,'
she said, gently. ‘This man Is a minis­

him our stoiy and lie will marry us here

“I stood before them; everyone was

ceremony was performed in low tones,
ami without attracting attention. I
gave up my place to them, and. as the
car was crowded. I sat on the aym ol
their scut with my back to them and
screened them from observation.
“At the next station we met the train
that was to take tin* sweet young wife­
back to her home. There was no scene
at parting. The fretting, mouiiiug ami
bewailing had all been gone through
with weeks before. They felt now that
they had conquered fate and all adverse
circumstances. During those blissful
moments true love hud triumphed in

manly fashion and looked at me. She

veil and took my arm.
“ '1 will send your certificate,’ I whis­
pered, us I handed her over to the con­
ductor of the up-going train, and could
have wept at the sad little smile that
accompanied her fervent ‘thank you.'
That include*! all the service I had Wen
able to render her.
“I took the place by the young lieu­
tenant and buried myself in my morn­
ing paper. Presently he threw back h^s
bead and looked in my face.

’Better is a neighbor that is near
than a brother far off,' he said. *1 want
to recognize yon should we meet again.
I can never thank you.’
""‘Don't try,’ I said. 'Tell me about
yourself- prove to me thut I have not
been indiscreet.’
“’You have acquitted yourself like a
friend ami a comrade,’ he replied.
‘There was no reason that we should
not marry only that our parents and
guardians set their faces like a flint
against it because we were second cous­
ins. We had been companions from
childhood, and our growing intimacy
was encouraged. “They will always
remain like brother ami sister,” hud
been said scores of times.
’* ‘Ilow strangely some people outlive
their youth, it was so with these. They
could not understand how the boy and
the girl who had romped together and
studied from the same book should,
after a separation of a half-dozen years,
fall desperately in love at first sight.
*’ ‘They laughed at us. They said we
were too young to tnarry; that it was
only a hit of sentiment enhanced by the
romance of the tune and my changed
appearance in my regimentals. At
length they said if 1 would give up tnv
commission anil remain at home we
might he married. Of course we both
scouted the idea. I was called away
from home on some business arrange­
ment, and while absent was unex­
pectedly recalled to the Held. 1 have no
doubt my wife s mother arranged it
with my colonel, who is her kinsman.
1 sent a message to my love that 1
should pass through-junction -,n
this train and she slipped away V> bid
me good by—and returns home as mv
wife.’
“’She will keep the marriage private,
of course.’

Not at all. We arranged that. She
will announce herself as my wife and
go at onee to-night to my house. Thank
heaven it will now ho home: it lias not
been so since my mother died.’
“Poor fellow, he went at once into
the thickest of the fray. In a week he
had been promoted to*the captaincy of
his company, and in less than a month
he earned a colonel’s commission; but
it cost him his life, and his Isaly was
carried home for burial. The por.r
young bride had »>oen having a stormy
time with relatives, hut nmv from an
object of indignation she became one of
intense compassion. Her quiet but pa­
thetic agony drew both families to he*
feet and held them there. Mo young, so
beautiful, so brave, and so constant,
she has hail a legion of admirers, and
it is true that one man at least has re­
mained single for her sake.

to have become general durinsr the time

ana lora. - r rom to 1646 its use is
exceedingly rare, and I hare never as yet
seen a book printed prior to 1625 in which
it appeared. - In the century immediately
preceding the Seventeenth it became the

interesting but perhaps unanswerable
query. . ' .
in a like manner the printers and lan
guage makers of the latter part of the Si x-
leenm . century began to recognise the
fact that there was a sound in snoken
English which was without a representa­
tive in the shape of an alphabetical, sign
or character, as the first sound in the
word wet. Prior to that time, it had
always been spelled as vet, they having
me long souna oi u or of two u s together.

sound they began to spell such words as
wet, weather web, etc., with two n's, and as
the u of that date was a typical y. the
three words in italics above looked like
this : wet, weather, web. . After awhile the
type founders recognized tbe faot that the

the two v's together and made the

the w are given. The first is the old

tbe last stroke of the first v crosses the

Parafflne Floors.

M. iiui-d, of Lyons, has stopped aliso­
luteiy the sweeping of floors in liospi:a
wards. He has the iloors covered with
a coat of a solution of paratine in pe ,,.
leum. which makes them impermeable to
anything and gives them a brown tint.
A single application lasts two years.
Thus prepared the floors stand verv well
wiping every day with a damp cloth,
moistened with some antiseptic solution.
The same process can be applied with
advantage to barracks, school room and
other places. Iu private dwellings, -.vhere
the fioors are covered with carpet, tlicrs
should be substituted for the ordinary
sweeping the use of mechanical brushes
which, instead of making the dust !v,
eollect it in special boxes, from wliitli'i:
can be thrown into the lire, the
destroyer aud perifier of all germs. This
mode of sweeping ia especially requisite
in the lower stories of houses, Mnn
microbean germs are found ia greite
numbers in the lower layers of the at­
mosphere. They are ten times more
numerous in the center of l'aris in tin
vicinity of the Seine, than on higher
grouud. Iu every house, considered
separately, the air of the upper stories
is incontestably purer and freer from
microbes than that of the lower stones,

■ SHOVING THE QUEER.-’
An Interesting Chat AA'ith an Officer
of the Secret Service.
Washington, Dec. 2—The sevivtary
of the treasury has completed his re­
port. which is ready for the public,
and deals ably with financial questions.
Uncle Sam. like other men, needs
filthy lucre, and the all-important ques­
tion of the day now seems to be how
to raise the needful,
AA idle there is a scarcity of the genu­
ine article your uncle keeps his eyes
open for those who coi&terfeit the
coin of the realm, and there is always
a force of detectives at work in that
branch.
The “secret service’’ is a bureau in
the treasury department, whose head
is an expert detective and whose sub­
ordinates are unknown to the outside
world. But the ramifications of this
service reach out to the different cities
of the union and explore the secluded
haunts in quiet country towns.
Up in one of the numerous rooms
id- the treasury department we find a
small chamber which is a museum
in which are collected the tools, pic
tures and work of the counterfeiters.
On one side is a ease of ugly pistols;
on the other, a frame full of photos
of famous “shavers of the queer,” while
behind a glass are numberless speci­
mens of counterfeit or ""bad"" money in
bills and coins.
To those whose curiosity is excited
by the queer exhibit the polite chief
clerk is always ready to give infor­
mation.
""The annual report of the secretary
is just completed,” ho explained, ""but
there are many little things of interest
in the service outside of dry statis­
tics. For instance, it is not generally
known that it is against the law to
print, photograph, engrave or paint a
lac-simile of a United States note or
coin, but such is the case. AVe have
there,” he continued, pointing to a
large placard bearing an engraving
representing a $2 bill. "" a picture which
was placed in a window to advertise
some .$2 shoes. This drawing was
seized by the officers. A photographer
had as an advertisement a representa­
tion of a $5 note, and this also was
confiscated. •
""This photograph of a man, seated in
a chair and held by two others, is
the picture of a famous counterfeiter,
lie was determined we should not
catch his face, so you see he has wrin­
kled it up so as to bo almost unrec­
ognizable.
""One of the easiest ways of counter­
feiting is to change a bill from one
denomination to another—say a $lO bill
to a SIOO note, or SIOO to S2OO. But
as a rule large bills are not those most
often counterfeited, for the reason that
it is much easier to pass a $2 note
undetected than it is one for SI,OOO.
A small note passes unnoticed where
a large one would be challenged.
“Of course the counterfeiters are
fine engravers, and their work is sim­
ply wonderful, still they never get off
as good a specimen as that put out
by the government. The lines in the
portraits are not near so fine.

“When a fellow has made false
money his first object is to give it an
old look, so it can more easily escape
detection. Some do this by rubbing
anew note in tlie sweat from an over­
heated horse, as this gives a soiled,
oily look, and others us coffee or tea
to effect a stain.
“We have in the department here
a lady who is remarkably gifted with
such a delicate sense of touch that it
is simply impossible to pass a coun­
terfeit on her. One bad note, which
had passed the sub-treasury in New
York, was detected and thrown out
while passing through her hands.
“Mutilating coins is a foolish habit
with some people and they do not seem
to realize that they are practically
withdrawing it from circulation. For
instance, the ten-ceut pieces used by
ladies for bangles, or on which initials
are cut, can only be redeemed as bul­
lion—they are money no longer, as
they no longer represent the coin of
the realm.”

TONS OF PUBLIC DOCUMENTS.
St. Louis Globe-Democrat: There are
between 700,000 and 1.000,000 public
documents piled up in the vaults of the
capitol. They have been accumulating
there ever since the government began
to be so prodigal with good white pa
per, printer’s ink and fast presswork.
Some of tnem are worth $25 a volume.
A man who makes a specialty in deal­
ing in government publications has of­
fered that. Most of them are not
worth 25 cents. Mr. Richardson of
Tennessee has undertaken to get the
whole accumulation cleared oxit. He
proposes to have those books distribut­
ed to libraries and institutions of vari­
ous kinds. He also proposes to regu­
late future printing so that only those
public documents for which there is a
demand shall be printed, and so that
such shall be distributed promptly.
Meanwhile, as he carries the load of
700,000 accumulated volumes, he grows
more and more round-shouldered.
SUICIDE FOLLOWS DISCHARGE.
Theodore Lindemann, a Brewing Co.’s
Bookkeeper, Kills Himself.
Quincy, TIL, Dec. 2.—Theodore Linde­
mann, five years book-keeper and as­
sociated with the local manager of the
Anheuser-Busch Brewing association,
shot himself through the head and died
instantly. Thanksgiving day the brew­

tiring book-keepers at various branches.
His discharge preyed upon his mind
and resxdted in his rash act. He leaves

CARLIN PARTY SAFE
ITS MEMBERS FINALLY REACH
KENDRICK. IDAHO.
RESCUED AFTER MOST SHOCK­
ING EXPERIENCES.
Terrible Sufferings of the Lost Humors
in Their M’auderiugs in the Bitter
Root Mountains—Cook Colgate Aban­
doned to His Fate.—Guide Spencer's
Story.
Missouri, Mont., Dec. 2—After days
of indescribable hardships, the Carlin
party, consisting of W. E. Carlin. M*.
L H. Himmelwright and J. Harvey
Pierce, of New York; Martin Spencer,
guide, and William Keeley, trapper,
arrived at Kendrick, Idaho, yesterday
under the care and guidance Lieuten­
ant Elliott's relief party, which more
than throe weeks ago started into the
mountains to save them and but for
whose energy and bravery they would
now be lying dead in the snowdrifts,
with the winds of the Bitter Root
whistling i requiem over their re­
mains.
The party was mot a few miles from
Kendrick by General Carlin, who had
been there for a week awaiting their
arrival. The meeting of father and
sou cannot be described. Although
worn and fatigued, the party were in
comparatively good condition, having
been carefully nursed by Lieutenant
Elliott.
As anticipated, Cook Colgate was
abandoned, and is by this time dead,
every effort to save him proving un­
availing. He was unable to walk, and
it being impossible to carry him the
pitiful parting was necessitated that
the lives of the remainder might be
saved. A more pathetic story of part­
ing has never been related and not
one of the little band can recount it
without bursting into tears.
Colgate’s home is at Post Falls. Ida­
ho. where he has a wife and four
children, whoso only hopes now are
that his bleached bones may be found
in the spring and given decent inter­
ment.
THE GUIDE’S STORY.
In talking of the hardships encount­
ered by the party from the time they
attempted to get out of what promised
to be at one time their snowy tomb.
Guide Spencer says:
“We arrived at Waim Springs,
which is on the North Fork of the Mid­
dle Fork of the Clearwater , sixty
miles from the mountains, on Septem­
ber 28. We had been here but four
days when I began to see snow at a
distance on the mountains, and 1 at
once advised the party that we had
better start back, but they declined,
having been there so short a time and
killed scarcely any game. It was their
desire to stay longer, so we stayed
until Oct 10, when we started ahead
to find the trail. After going lifteeu
miles we came to four feet of snow,
Colgate then became unable to walk,
and as we could not use our snow
shoes we went back and struck the
river. Our predicament now fully
dawned upon us, and while we did
not yet lose courage we readily realiz­
ed the fact that only the greatest of
luck could pull us out of the moun­
tains alive. M’e spent four days in
constructing two rafts and loading
everything possible on them.
“We started with Carlin, Ilommel­
wi-ight. Pierce and Colgate on the lirst
raft and Keeley and myself on the
second. Keeley is a trapper whom we
engaged to accompany us down. M'e
brought all the provisions he had, and
but for those provisions we would
have all perished, Keeley included, and
the self sacrifice that the noble old
man made in giving us all of his sup­
plies and risking his life for us wo shall
remember with gratitude to our dying
day. We had gone out about half a
mile when the first raft swamped,
striking a rock, and throwing Pierce
and Colgate inlo the river, and it was
only by the most perilous efforts that
either was saved. We finally straight­
ened up the rafts and started aga:n.
M’e worked without much food tr sleep
for live days and got twenty miles
further, when we struck swift rapids
which we could not possibly get
through. Here we landed our rafts
with great difficultly, but on the wrong
side of the river. This forced ns to
fell a large tree, five feet through,
across the river, and finally we ferried
cursclves across.

“During all this time Colgate was
getting worse, llis limbs were so
badly swollen that he could not walk,
and he had been delirious for some
time. After getting across the river
we knew we could do uothiug more for
him, aud it meant death to stay with
him longer. Fixing him as comfort­
ably as possible aud dividing our pro­
visions equally with him, which con­
sisted of forty pounds of flour, ten
pounds of beans and three pounds of
bacon, with plenty of tea, we knelt
beside him aud in forwent prayer we
bade him good-by. The snow fell piti­
less! 3' aud the weather was becoming
extremely cold. We made a fire,
placed wood within his reach and came
away, Colgate moaning and, amid sobs,
making us promise to tell his family
that he died like a man. He begged
of us that we should go and save our­
selves. And so we left. This was
on Nov. 13. We resumed our journey,
abandoning rafts and going overland.
The trip was as perilous as one on
water, for we constantly came in con­
tact with boulders and jagged rocks
and the embankments were so abrupt—
often from two to three hundred feet
above the river—that to miss our foot­
ing meant sure death. One of the
hardest day’s travel we had we accom­
plished only one mile.
“During our travel we killed five
grouse and caught eleven small trout.
On the seventeenth day our provisions
were all gone. We could no longer se­
cure game nor fish and were getting
too weak to travel. In the next three
days we had nothing to eat but a few
huckleberries and tea leaves. On the
twentieth day I was ahead of the party
about half a mile, when I met EUoitt
and party who said we were then 100
miles from civilisation. I informed
him of the condition we were in and
he at once prepared for our comfort.
Shortly the rest of the party came up,

• and 1 teli you ii was a most joyous
meeting autl you could plainly see the
tears trickle from our eyes. We set to
work attain building rafts and once
more startl'd down the river, reaching
the forks, on Tuesday morning.
“Colgate was nearly dead when we
left him and we knew it was of no
use to try to go up the river to find
him; it would have been an impossibili­
ty to have gone, so while Elliott of­
fered to make the venture, it would
have proved suicidal. There was no
way of getting back to the point from
whence we came without going miles
overland and with the snow falling at
the rate of a foot a day such an at­
tempt was out of question.”
Ihe entire party left this morning
for Spokane, where General Carlin
has taken up his residence, having last
week retired from active service in the
army. Himmelwright and Pierce will
at once proceed to New York, while
Mrs. Mill Carlin is coming westward
to join her husband, who will also
reside in Spokane with General Car­
lin. Keeley. the trapper, will remain
in Spokane this winter at the expense
of General Carlin, as it is now impossi­
ble for him to return to the hunting
giounds.
FROM DULUTH TO THE GULF.
An Important Railway Project As­
sumes Tangible Form.
Des Moines, Dec. 2.—The Lake Su­
perior. Southwestern and Gulf Railway
company, with a capital stock of $5,-
000.000, recently tiled articles of in­
corporation with the secretary of state
at Des Moines. The real object of the
company has been kept secret while
some important preliminaries wore be­
ing arranged, but it came to light to­
day.
The corporation has for its object
the construction and operation under
one management of one or more roads
in Minnesota, one north and south
line in lowa, with a system in Mis­
souri. which, with the construction of
200 miles south from Aurora in Mis­
souri, will give the new road access
to Little Rock, Ark., at which point
connections for New Orleans and Sa­
bine Pass will be made. The whole
system will give a direct lino of rail
communication from Duluth. Minn.,
to the gulf at Sabine Pass, an arrange­
ment long desired.

ft is understood that J. V. Far well,
General G. M. Dodge ami George W.
Cable, of Chicago, are among the back­
ers of the scheme. The new line Avill
relieve the milling, grain and lumber
interests of the northwest and trans-
Mississippi country of the arbitrary
demands of the trunk lines east of
Chicago, and afford them direct rail
and ocean connections with the mar­
kets of the old world.
The lines already built, together with
those upon which construction will
Boon begin, will shorten the distance
to the gulf from 128 to 150 miles and
will traverse the most productive por­
tions of the northwest and south.
From Aurora, in Missouri, to Little
Hock, in Arkansas, for a distance of
200 miles the proposed line will tra­
verse a thickly settled and prosperous
section of country with no competing
line within thirty miles on either side.
The president of the new line is E.
II Bristol who represents a number
of well-known capitalists in St. Paul
and Minneapolis. The vice president,
and general manager is Colonel L. M.
Martin general manager for live years
past of the Ties Moines Northern and
Western, with headquarters in this
city. Though Colonel Martin declined
to go into details of the new enterprise
it is understood that ids selection for
l the position of vice president and
general manager is largely due to the
1 confidence reposed in him as a railroad
I manager by Gen. G. M. Dodge and
other practical railroad men and capi­
talists.
.1. M. Miller, who until recently for
four years past was general auditor
for the Des Moines Northern and West­
ern and who resigned to accept his
present position, lias been appointed
secretary of the new company and is
at present located at Springfield, Mo.,
where he lias removed his family and
established an office.
L. S. Steadman has been appointed
locating engineer and right of way
agent, and with President Bristol is
im w out along the line in southern Mis­
sovri. They will return in a few days
and early next week, with Colonel Mar­
tin and a number of capitalists from
St. Paul. Minneapolis, Chicago, and sev­
eral railroad contractors from Omaha,
they will again go back to Missouri and
traverse the proposed route from Au­
rora to Little Rock, with a view to
receiving bids, preparatory to begin­
ning the work of construction from Au­
rora south within the next thirty
days. Colonel Martin will meet a num­
ber of capitalists interested in the new
line in Chicago Monday.

nal.""Another half hour passed away, and
still the trail led along this strange
rock ribbed groove in the desert, the
dry bed of some long ""lost stream.
When first met, it seer ted to be cutting
directly across their line of inarch, now
it had turned southward, and for sev­
eral miles ahead south or west of south
was its general course. The light was
now broad and clear, though the sun
had not yet peeped across the moun­
tain range to their loft. The pace was
rapid, Drummond frequently nrging
his men to the trot or banter. Out to
the front 400 or 500 yards, often lost to
view in tho windings of tho way, Ser­
geant Leo with a single trooper rode in
the advance, but not once had he sig­
naled a discovery worth recording.
Both wagon and hoof tracks here pur­
sued a common road. It was evident
that some horsemen had found it neces­
sary to rido alongside. It was evident,
too, that the outlaws were traveling at
full speed, as though anxious to reach
some familiar lair before turning to face
tHeir expected pursuers. Every one in
the gang, from Pasqual down to their
humblest packer, well knew that it
conld not be long before cavalry in
strong fcirce would come trotting in
chase. The squadron ' at Stoneman
would surely be on the inarch by the
coming sunset. As for C troop, they
had little to fear. Pasqual laughed
with savage glee as he thought how
he had lured them in scattered detach­
ments far up to the Gila or over to the
Christobal. No need to fear the coming
of the late escort of the paymaster. By
this time those not dead, drugged or
drunk were worn out with fatigue.
Over the body of his bandit brother, the
swarthy Ramon, he had fiercely rejoiced
that seven to one he had avenged his
death, and Pasqual counted on the fin­
gers of his brown and bloody hand tho
number of the victims of, the night
Ponoyan and his fellow trooper killed





. -.Aytc FMg





on the open plain; the paymaster and
his clerk, Mullan and the other soldier,
dead in their tracks and burned to
ashes by this tiznc, and, best of all,
""that pig of a sergeant, "" as Moreno
called him, that hound and murderer,
Feeny ha who had slain Ramon
bound, gagged and left to miserable
death by torture. Indeed, as he was
jolted along in the ambulance, groan­
ing and cursing by turns, Pasqual won­
dered why lie had not insisted that Har­
.vey, tot), should be given the coup do
grace before their start. It was an un­
pardonable omission. Never mind!
There in tho brand new Concord that
came clattering along was booty that
outrivaled all. Thero waB wealth
far exceeding tho stacks of treasury
notes old Harvey's daughters old
Harvey's daughters. It was with mad,
feverislt joy that when at last the sun
came pouring in a flood of light over
the desert of the Cababi he listened to
tho report of a trusted suhordinate.
""I could see every mile of tho road
with my glasses, capitan, from tho cliff
top yonder every milo from Moreno's
to where we struck the canyon. There
isn't a sign of dust thero isn't sigu
of a pursuing party. ' '
""Buenol Then wo rest when wo
reach tho cave. This is even better
than I hoped.""
Btit thero were two elements in the
problem Capitan Pasqual had failed to
consider Lieutenant Drummond's
scout in tho Christobal, Cochises' hflnd
of Chiricahuas in the Santa Maria.
Who could have foreseen that tho little
troop, finishing its duties at the north­
ern end of tho range and about turning
south to rescout the Santa Maria, had
ridden out upon tho plain, summoned
by the beacon at Picacho pass, and less
than two hours after their hurried start
from tho burning ruins at Moreno's
were speeding on their trail ? The best
fieldglasses ever stolen from the paternal
government could not reveal to the flee­
ing outlaw that, only two or three miles
back iu tho dim recesses of tho crooked
gorge, the bluecoats were following
in hot pursuit. Who could havo dream­
ed that a band of Apaches, cut off from
their native wilds by detachments from
Bowie, Lowell and Crittenden, and
forced to make a wide detour to the
southwest, had sought refuge in the
very gorge of tho Cababi whither Pas­
qual with all speed was urging his
men ?
""Wo rest when wo reach tho cave.""
Ah, even tho torment of his wound
could not have wrung from the robber
chief this longed for order had he
dreamed what was coming at his back.
""How are tho girls getting on?"" he
asked of his hot and wearied aid. ""Are
they tranquil now?""
'""They have to be,"" was tho grim re­
ply. ""Tho little one dare not open her
eyes, and Sanchez has his knife at tho
cider's throat. ""
And the sunrise had brought with it
new inspiration new purposo to those
who came trotting to the rescue. Just
as the dills on tho; western sido were
tipped and fringed with rose and gold,

from point to point, always carefully
peering around each bend before signal-

Abashed at nothing, a commercial traveler
In the south once propounded a question to a
couple of clergymen, whom he encountered
on a railroad train, whjch illustrates how
easily a man may be tripped on a simple,
little ""catch ' problem, says the New York
Herald.
ihe drummer enterad Into a conversation
with the ministers and entertained them
amazingly with his brilliant conversation
touebin: men and affairs. Gradually the topics
changed, until at last the talk was ol Dr.
•Talmage and his visit to the Holy Land. .
""Speaking of the Holy Land."" said the
graceless commercial man. ""1 was quite in­
terested to read in a New- York pa per recently
that a party of explorers in Palest ine had dis­
covered a huge heap of bones. Which, from
their size and quantity, are supposed to be of
the children which Herod ordered killed
They were found in a cave, which had been
closed for centuries, which accounted for
their preservation.""
""Indeed?"" replied one of the clergymen,
much interested. ""I had not heard of it. It
is'-ertalnlv n surorising discovery.""
“Yes,” continued the drummer, “and. oddly

looked at the drummer suspiciously.

About forty years ago the late Pr. Bene*
Jones was the leader of ail scientific or­
ganisations in England. To him came one
day. from Germany, a letter couched by
Trof. Dubois-Raymond in something like
these terms: ""You Kngiish are the oddest
people! Here, to our laboratories, comes
every year a young Irish schootmaster
called Tvndail, witfc the quickest brain,

MANY OF THEIR CUSTOMS ARE tHE
REVERSE OF OURS.
How They Compare With tfc* 1
Wlmt Constitutes an Education—So He­
reditary Aristocracy In Chian—The Peo­
ple Vary In Different Sections.
The samples we get of Chins in onr
country give us very inadequate ideas i
of the people. We have here to coutem- ;
plate a civilization entirely nnlike our
own. bnt in itseli much more complete
than ours. Irfthe presence of tho Chi­
nese. all Europeans and Americana aro !
parvenus. These people burned coal
before the Christian era. They invent­
ed printing 1,000 years before Gnten­
lwrg and Faust flourished, and they
knew the use of gunpowder when our
forefathers were using liows and ar­
rows. In most things which appear on
the surface they ate onr antipodes.
They mount a horse from the right side
instead of the left, read from left to
right, say west south instead of south­
west, their mariner's needle points to
the south, tli« men wear petticoats and
the women trousers, they shave the
fronts of their heads and not their faces,
shake their own hands instead of each
others as a greeting, write their family
names first and their given names aft­
erward, have their marginal notes at
the top of their books, place a distin­
guished guest on tho left and are care- 1
ful not to uncover iu his presence, wear
white for mourning, the men sew and
the women work ill the fields, and soon
to the end of the chapter.
We shall find in China the origin of
much that we have seen in Japan. The
position of woman in the family and so­
ciety is about the same, except that the
Japanese women do not cramp their
feet, and therefore call go about more
freely. The domestic architecture is
similar, so far as external construction
goes, lmt tlie Chinese houses have no
mats, and the people do not squat oil
the floor. Both wear loose, flowing
robes, which the Chinese button, lmt
the Japanese do not. Ill the conversa­
tion of the people the Chinese indulge
iu lionorifies as much as the Japanese.
It is the correct thing to ask your friend
to condescend to come from his elegant
house to your miserable hovel, or to al­
low ids distinguished cup of tea to de­
scend to your unworthy self. Tho Chi­
nese elaasics are also the classics in Ja­
pan^ and the Chinese ideagraphs are
ust'il* by Japanese writers. Education
is mainly etiquette. The Chinese have
3,000 rules of behavior, which the edu­
cated man must know. If a man have
bad manners, they say he is not edu­
cated.
The Chinese sages, like Confucius.
Mencius and others whose works are
classics, enunciated a high grade of
ethics. Confucius stated the golden
rule, though negatively, ttins: ""If there 1
is anythiug I do not want done tome. I
will not do it unto another.” His eth- |
ical teachings take rank with those of
the Greek and Roman moralists uml
the Hebrew prophets, bnt are without
reference to a Supreme Being who re­
quires ns to keep his commandments.
The family customs are similar to the
Japanese. Society is patriarchal. The
family, not the individual, is consid­
ered. Marriages are arranged as in Ja­
pan to ]>erpetuate the family, and go lie­
tweens are employed to settle the terms.
There is only one wife, hut concubines
are taken into the house at will. The
wife finds life burdensome when she is
the servant of the household, especially
of her father-in-law and mother-in-law.
lmt when she becomes a mother-in-law
she gets her own innings and makes it
warm for her daughter-in-law.
The Chinese have as many genuflex­
ions as the Japanese ami numerous
grades of obeisances to be employed ac­
cording to circumstances. Three prostra­
tions, each \Mtli three knockings of the
head against the floor, are supposed to he
about the extreme exhibition of resjiect.
The people vary a good deal in the dif­
ferent sections. The south of China is
mountainous, and the peojde there are
smaller, more volatile and brighter
than in the north, where the crowded
dwellers on the plains and paddy fields
are heavier, less excitable, not so quick
to see or act. There is no hereditary
aristocracy in China. All the people
are hound to obey the will of the em­
peror and have no rights he is hound
to respect. There is no caste, as in India.
The people are classified as natives and
aliens, the latter being subdued peo­
ple in the pmvinees; conquerors and
conquered, with special reference to
tne prohibition of marriages lietween
tile Mantchoo and Chinese, and freemen
and slaves. There are no laws against
slavery. Every native is allowed to
purchase slaves and retain their chil­
dren in servitude, but the number of
slaves is small, and their condition is
comparatively easy. Probably there are
lio better mannered people in the world
Ilian the educated Chinese. They are
Also very conqietent business men. and
as such enjoy an excellent reputation.—

Marriage Proposal Reform. ,
A suggestion is made tor a legal re­
form which, while retaining breach of
promise actions, would deprive them of
all their ornamental trimmings in the
shape of love letters and the other usual
incidents ot courtship. It is proposed
that no promise of marriage should he
held valid unless it is made in writing
upon properly stamped paper. Young
ladies might affix a sixpenny stamp to
the letter in which the swain declares
hia affections and ask him to be so good
as to cancel it with bis autograph.—

There are said to be about 69,000 min­
isters of religion in this country. About
50,000, 1 warrant, came from early homes,
which had to struggle for the necessaries
of life. The sons of rich bankers and
merchants generally become bankers and
merchants. The most of those who be­
come ministers are the sons of those who
had terrific struggle to get their every­
day bread. The collegiate and theolog­
ical education of that son took every
luxury from the parental table for eight
years. The other children were more
scantily appareled. The son at college
every little while got a bundle from
home. In it were the socks that mother
had knit, sitting up late at night, her
sight not as good as once it was, and
there also were some delicacies from the
sister's hand for the voracious appetite
of a hungry student.
A HARD PULL.
The years go by, and the son has been
ordained and is preaching the glorious
gospel, and a great revival comes, and
souls by scores and hundreds accept the
gospel from the lips of that young
preacher, and father and mother, quite
old now, are visiting the son at the vil­
lage parsonage, and at the close of a Sab­
bath of mighty blessing father and moth­
er retire to their room, the son lighting
the way and asking them if he can do
anything to make them more comforta­
ble, saying if they want anything in the
night just to knock on the wall.
And then all alone father and mother
talk over the gracious influences of the

day and say: ""Well, it was worth all we i
went through to educate that boy! It i

was a hard pull, but we held on till the
work was done. The world may not
know it; but, mother, we held the rope,

iidn't we?"" And the voice, tremulous
frith joyful emotion, responds: ""Yes, fa- ;
cher; we held the rope. I feel my work
s done. Now, Lord, lettest thou thy .
servant depart in peace, for mine eyes
have seen thy salvation."" ""Pshaw' says
the father. "" ""I never felt so much like
living in my life as now. I want to see

what tint fellow is going on to d 3, he

has begnn so well.""

Oh, men and women here assembled,

you brag sometimes how you have

Fought your way in the world, but

think there have been helpful influences

that you have never fully acknowledged

Has there not been some influence in
your early cr present home that the
world cannot see? Does there not reach
So you from among the New England

hills, or from western prairies, or from

nouthern plantation, or from English or
Scottish or Irish home, a cord of influ-

vnce that ha3 kept you rirjht when you

would have gone astray, and which, aft
tr you had made a crooked track, re

called you? The rope may be as long as

.30 years, or 500 miles long or 3,000 miles
long, but hands that went out of mortal

sight long ago still hold the rope.

You want a very swift horse, and you

need to rowel him with sharpest spurs,

and to let the reins lie loose upon the
neck, and to give a shout to a racer if
you are going to ride out of reach of
your mother's prayers. Why, a ship

crossing the Atlantic in seven days can't
sail away from them! A sailor finds
them on the lookout as . he takes his
place, and finds them on the mast as he
climbs the ratlines to disentangle a rope
in the tempest, and finds them swinging
on the hammock when he turns in. Why
not be frank and acknowledge it? The
most of ue would long ago have been
dashed to pieces had not gracious and
loving hands steadily and lovingly and
mightily lield the rope.
A TIME OP PERIL.
But there must come a time when we
shall find out who these Damascenes
were who lowered Paul in the basket
and greet them and all those who have
rendered to God and the world unrecog­
nized and unrecorded services. That is
going to be one of the glad excitements
of heaven the hunting up and picking
out of those who did great good on earth
and got no credit for it. Here the
church has been going on 19 centuries,
and this is probably the first sermon ever
recognizing the services of the people in
that Damascus balcony. Charles G. Fin­
ney said to a dying Christian, ""Give my
love to St. Paul when you meet him.""
When you and I meet him, as Ave will, I
shall ask him to introduce me to those
people who got him out of the Damas­
cene peril.
Once for 36 hours we expected every
moment to go to the bottom of the ocean.
The waves struck through the skylights,
and rushed down into the hold of the
ship, and hissed against the boilers. It
was an awful time, but by the blessing
of God and the faithfulness of the men
in charge we came out of the cyclone,
and we arrived at home. Each one, be­
fore leaving the ship, thanked Captain
Andrews. I do not think there was a
man or woman that went off that ship
without thanking Captain Andrews, and
when years after I heard of his death I
was impelled to write a letter of condo­
lence to his family in Liverpool.
Everybody recognized the goodness,
the courage, the kindness of Captain An

drews, but it occurs to me now that we

never thanked the engineer.; He stood
away down in the darknesaamid the
hissing furnaces doing his whole duty.
Nobody thanked the engineer, but God

recognized his heroism, and his continu­
ance, and his fidelity, and there will be
just as high reward for the engineer who

worked out of sight as the captain who

stood on the bridge of the ship in the
midst of the howling tempest.

ALL POINTED OUT.
A Christian woman was seen going

along the edge of a wood every eventide,

and the neighbors in the country did not

understand how a mother with so many

cares auti anxieties siiould waste bo

much time as to be idly sauntering out

evening by evening. It was found out
afterward that she went there to pray

for her household, and while there one

evening she wrote that beautiful hymn,

famous in all ages for cheering Christian
hearts:

I love to steal awhile away
From every cumbering care
And spend the hours of setting day
In humble, grateful prayer.
Shall there be no reward for such un

pretending yet everlasting service?

e go into long sermon to prove that

we will be able to recognize people in

God will introduce us. We shall have
them all pointed out. You would not
be guilty of the impoliteness of having
friends in your parlor not introduced,
and celestial politeness will demand that

we be made acquainted with ail the

heavenly household. What rehearsal of

old times and recital of stirring reminis

cences.

If others fail to give introduction, God

will take us through, and before our first
24 hours in heaven if it were calculat

ed by earthly timepieces have passed
we shall meet and talk with more heav­
enly celebrities than in our entire mortal
state we met with earthly celebrities.
Many who made great noise of useful

ness will sit on the last seat by the front
door of the heavenly temple, while right
up within arm's reach of the heavenly

tnrone win De many who, though they
could not preach themselves or do great

exploits tor Uod, nevertheless held the

rope. -

Come, let us go right up and accost

those on this circle of heavenly thrones.
Surely, they must have killed in battle a
million men. Surely they must have

been buried with all the cathedrals

Bounding a dirge and all the towers of all
the cities tolling the national grief. Who

J rt thou, mighty one of heaveitf ""I lived
by choice the unmarried daughter in a
humble home that I might take care of
my parents m their old age, and I en­
dured without complaints all their quer-

nlousness and ministered to all their
wants for 20 years.""
BEFORE THE THRONES.
Let us pass on round the circle of
thrones. Who art thou, mighty one of
heaven? ""I was for 30 years a Christian
invalid and suffered all the while, occa­
lionally writing a note of sympathy for
those worse off than I, and was general
confidant of all those who had, trouble,
and once in,awhile I was strong enough
to make-.a garment for that poor family
in the back' lane."" Pass on to another

.throne. Who art thou, mighty one cf
heaven? ""I was the mother who raised a
whole family of children for God, and

they are out in the world Christian mer

chants, Christian mechanics, Christian

wives, and I have had full reward of all
my toil."" Let us pass on in the circle of

thrones. ""I had a Sabbath school class,

and they were always on my heart, and

they all entered the kingdom of God,

and I am waiting for their arrival.""

But who art thou, the mighty one of
heaven on this other throne? ""In time of

bitter persecution I owned a house in
Damascus a house on the wall. A man

who preached Christ was hounded from
ctreet to street, and I hid him from the

assassins, and when I found them break

ing in my house and I could no longer
keep him safely I advised him to flee for
ais life, and a basket was let down over

the wall with the maltreated man in it,

and I was oe who helped hold the rope.'
And I said, ""Is that all?"" And he an
swered, ""That is all.""

And while I was lost in amazement I
heard a strong voice that sounded as
though it might once have been hoarse

from many exposures and triumphant
as though it might have belonged to one
of .the martyrs and it said, ""Not many
mighty, not many noble are called, but
God hath chosen the weak things of the
world to confound the things which are

mighty, and base things of the world and
things which are despised hath God
chosen yea, and things which are not
to bring to naught things which are, that
no flesh should glory in his presence.""
And I looked to see from whence the
voice came, and, lo! it was the very one
who had said, ""Through a window in a

basket was I let down by the wall.""
EFFECT OF TRIFLES.

Henceforth think or notmng as insig­
nificant. A little thing may decide your
all. A Cunarder put out from England

for New York. It was well equipped,

but in putting up a stove in the pilot box

a nail was driven too near the compass.

You know how that nail would affect
the compass. The ship's officer, deceived
by that distracted compass, put the ship

200 miles off her right course, and sud

denly the man on the lookout cried,

""Land, hoi"" and the ship was halted
within a few yards of her demolition on
Nantucket shoals. A sixpenny nail came

near wrecking a Cunarder. Small ropes

hold mighty destinies.
A minister seated in Boston at his table.

lacking a word, puts his hand behind his

head and tilts back his chair to think,

and the ceiling falls and crushes tho

table and would have crushed him. A

minister in Jamaica at night by the light
of an insect, called the candlefly, is kept
from stepping over a precipice a hundred
feet. F. W. Robertson, the celebrated

English clergj-man, said that he entered

the ministry from a train of circum

stances started by the barking of a dog.

Had the wind blown one way on a cer

tain day the Spanish inquisition would
have been established in England, but it
blew the other way, and that dropped

the accursed institution with 75,000 tons

of shipping to the bottom of the sea or

flung the splintered logs on the rocks.

Nothing unimportant in your life or

mine, inree cipuers piaceu on tne rigut
side of the figure 1 wakoa thousand, and

six ciphers on the right side of the figure

1 a million, and our nothingness placed

on the right side may be augmentation
illimitable. All the ages of time and
eternity affected by the basket let down
from a Damascus balcony!

A young lady, lately and happily mar­

band, who does all of bis work at home.
It is very good work and pays very well,

are delighted with the opportunities for
being almost constantly together, re­
marks the Yonkers Statesman.

“Anu 1 can’t pay any more,” said the

Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone
Park, July 21.—A telegram, received here
this morning from a reliable source, says
a shock resembling an earthquake
was felt at Norris, Geyser Basin,
at 4 A. M. The new crater geyser
which has been quiet for some time broke
out with terrible force, throwing rocks
weighing twenty-five pounds to the height
of 200 feet, steam rising 500 feet accom­
panied by a roar equaling the combined
exhaust of a thousand locomotives,.which
could be heard for ten miles. Every gey­
ser in the Norris Basin played for hours.

The address declares that ""in view of
the general distress, at a time when
granaries are full, and in the natural
order of things producers and toilers
should be enjoying the fruits of their
labors, it seems that the time has come
for united action on the part of those
who create the wealth of the country.""

One of the causes which have brought
about this condition, the address says,
is the departure from the wise bimetallic
financial principle of Washington,
Jefferson and Hamilton, and the sub­
stitution of the mono-metallic policy
dictated by the European money­
holders and their American allies. A
review of financial legislation is given
to show what part is enacted in the
interest of the producing and of the
non-producing classes. The proposition
is set forth that before the demonetiza­
tion of silver 3,500 bushels of wheat or
35,000 pounds of cotton equalled the an­
nual pay of a senator or congressman,
while today 10,000 bushels of wheat or
100,000 pounds of cotton barely suffice
that formerly 35,000 bushels of wheat
or 350,000 pounds of cotton would have
paid the salary of the president, while
today he receives the equivalent of
100,000 bushels of wheat or 1,000,000
pounds of cotton, and the same propor­
tion applies to all other fixed salaries
and incomes.

Demoralization of the food producing
sections is said to have caused the man-'
ufacturers to lose the markets for their
goods, so that hundreds of thousands of
workmen have been

Thrown Out of Employment,

and the demonetization of half of the
world's volume of money to make it
comparatively easy for capitalists to
corner and manipulate the other half.
In the review of financial legislation, it
is charged that all acts since the civil
war have been in the interest of the
bondholders and against the producers,
and the Sherman law is said to have
been repealed at the demand of Europ­
ean financiers, although a grand fight
was made by the peoples representa­
tives.

ENDED IN A FARCE.

Tarsney Outrage Cases Dismissed at Colo­
rado City, Colo.
COLORADO CITY, Colo., Aug. 22.—The
Tarsney outrage cases ended in a farce
in Justice McCoach's court during the
afternoon. District Attorney Cochran
appeared before the court and asked
that the cases against the defendants be
dismissed. The district attorney said
he made this motion for the reason that
the evidence in the case had been re­
ceived by the grand jury, which had
failed to find true bills against any of
the defendants. The court granted the
motion. The people here are disgusted
with the whole affair.

Rumors of Early Action.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 22.—Chairman
Wilson of the ways and means commit­

Mr. .Wilson denies these statements, but
says he looks for the president's return
on Thursday. -**f

Design Approved by Secretary Carlisle
Different From Former Ones. .?5
WASHINGTON, Aug. 22.—The secretary
of the treasury has approved a design
for a new five dollar silver cerificate,
which has been prepared under the
direction of Mr. Claude M. Johnson,
chief of the bureau of engraving and
printing. The original of the design
was painted by Mr. Walter Sherlew,
the well known American artist. The
picture itself occupies more than two­
thirds of the face of the note. The cen­
tral figure is an angel with outspread
wings, her feet resting upon the earth
and her uplifted right hand holding an
electric light. Half reclining at her
right is a female figure with a trumpet
at her lips, proclaiming the achieve­
ments and progress of the nation.*
Further to her, right is an allegorical
figure of a man, representing Power,
guiding with his left hand three horses
abreast, while with his right he grasps
from the clouds a thunderbolt which is
connected by a ribbon with the light
held by the central figure. At the left
is an eagle and another female figure
with a dove, denoting peace. In the
right background is a half concealed
picture of the Capitol. Persons compe­","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn89081128/1894-08-22/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,mnhi_audi_ver01,"","","",true,ca,New Ulm review.,F.W.

Do yon ever use ink ? Niarly every
man, woman and child uses the fluid and
yet few know anything about how it is
made. With the aid of ink history is
written, or printed, therefore the im­
portance of cood ink stands ud be'ore
you. The oldest inscriptions known are
written on stone in the British museum,
they were carved 4000 years ago. The
oldest specimen of written language in
ink extant, is on an Egyptian Papyrus,
now in the museum at Paris. This writ­
ing is about 3500 yearsold. The Chinese
:laim that thev invented ink 5000 vears
ago, but they have no records or docu­
ments to prove it.
The best writing inks of the urcscnt
time have for their bases Alenno nut-
galls and sulphate of iron. The know
ledge of bo manipulating and combining
these substances as to produce a good
ink is possessed by very few. The Thad­
deus Davids company are the onlv man
ufacturers of this ink and they hold
diplomas from the American institute
dating back to 1845 in which the writ
ing done with this ink is now very much
blacker than the copper plalc printing.
These inks have been well known in the
United States for four generations.
These are the very best inks known. We
keep a full supply on hand at 4c. bottle,
regular ink size, and if you bring your
bottle along will fill it for 2c. and 3c. as
we keep it in quart bottles at 48c, and
pints at 2oc. We want to sell you all

These aro bad times, very b»d
times, for political wool growers
and calamity howlers. Not only do
prices of domestic wools remain firm, at
an advance of about 10 per cent, above
McKinley prices of two mouths ago, but
there is unusual activity in the woolen
and cotton niltls. The Wool and Cotton
Reporter devotoH a page every week to
a ''Bulletin of New Enterprises,"" which,
however, includes mills shutting down.
There used to be more mills shutting
down than starting up; but since the
passage of ""the free trade Wilson bill,""
which was to ""annihilate"" the woolen
lndnstry, the reoord has been a remark­
able one—better than for any two weeks
during the four years of McKinleyism.
For the week ending September li the
Reporter montions five new mills, one
of which is a cotton mill, to cost (150,­
000, twenty-eight enlargements and
improvements, and twenty mills start­
ing up, one of which has been closed
nine months and another five years. Raw­
itzer Bros., of 8tafford Springs, are
mentioned as having settled with their
dissatUfied weavers, giving them a 25
per cent, advance in wages. This wage
advance is more than the Amerlcau
Economist could find In anv protected
industry during the first two years of
McKinleyism.
The record is a good oue, but that for
the week ending September 13 Is better.
During this week there were fifteen items
under the column headed ""New Mills.""
One of the mills mentioned is to have
48.000 spindles, and to be the largest
cotton mill in tlitf South. Another, for
making cotton, wool and worsted yarn,
is to occupy a building 110 by 200 feet,
which structure alone is to cost (30,000
""The plans for the new plant,"" hhvs the
reporter, ""have been ready Yor some
time, but It is said the construction of
the mill depended upon the settlement of
the t&iiff question."" It is located at
Philadelphia. Another cotton mill, with
25.000 eplndles, is to be built at Gaffney,
8. C,, with a capital of (250,000. Anothei
cotton mill, with (400,000 capital, Is
proposed for Bath, 8. C. Two hundred
thousand dollars have already been sub
scribed. The other new mills are for the
manufacture of woolen, cotton, knit
hosiery, and silk goods
Under the column ""Enlargements and
Improvements"" there are eighteen men­
tions. Under the column ""Starting Up
aud Shutting Down"" twenty mills
mentioned as having starting or about to
start up. One of these Iras beeu closed
since April last, another over a yeur, and
a third for two years. All three are
woolen mills. Only four are mentioned
as shutting dowu -one to make repairs,
another for two weeks, another because
of a death, and the last Is running on
short time on account of low water.
If this sort of business gees on until
Novembor the result of the election
are
may
not be so satisfactory to the Republicans
as they have beeu anticipating. They
must either manage to keep the mills
dosed or to keep the backwoods voters
from knowing that more wheels are turn­
ing than over before. Cau they stave off
prosperity until after election, if the
drought had only lasted two mouths
longer Republican prospects would be
brighter.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042354/1894-09-27/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,deu_arden_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Evening journal.,J.

W. Andrews, receiuly United States con­
Bui at Hankow, China, at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel tcday.
Sir. Andrews was asked to give the As­
so? iated Press his views of the present con­
dition of China, particularly in regard to
the danger threat*ning foreign residents at
Pekln, Shanghai, Hankow and other places
jpen to foreigners. He said in substance:
""The question of foreigners leaving Pekin
has been dl*'U-scd for some time j>ast.
Their danger cora""3 from the inability of
the Chinese officers to restrain their sol­
diers. th- latter always considering for­
eigners legitimate objects of ri.licule and
abuse. Pekin being to a certain extont
an isolated place it is most import-ant tfcat
the families of foreign residents should lie
tax-n lo points where they can have the
protection of gunboats.
??The bulk of the foreign population of
.Pekin are the foreign oiiicials and their
?families, comprising the members of the
-foreign legations and suh employes of the
Imperial customs as are on Sir Robert
Hart's staff and (hose belonging to the cus­
toms college.
""The only access to Pekln being overland
and a hard trip, the route from Pekln to
T en-Tsin could easily be obstructed or
closed, which would reader it impossible
to bring away the women and children
except under a strong armed foreign escort.
The British government has evidently taken
c<pr.lzance of this fact, and hence the re­
port that the government proposes to send
biue jackets and Indian troops to Pekin.
""I d. not think that there will be the
slightest resistance offtied to the entry of
the British forces into Pekin; tirst. because
of the respect that all foreign soldiers in­
spire among the Chlrcse, and, second, on
account of the ability ot the trained troops.
In small numbers, to successfully resist the
attack of any number of Chinese troops it
Is possible to bring against them.
""In rtgard to the coast treaty ports, they
?re all so situated that the foreign popula­
tion can be taken away on the packets
which touch at them almost daily.
""The treaty ports on the Yang-tse-Kiang
would be much harder to relieve In case of
trouble, and hence the necessity of antici­
pating it. The defense corps mentioned in
the Associated Press cable dispatches was
first organized In ls?i during the riots in­
augurated against the foreigners all along
the Yang-tse-Kiang at that time.""

In 1846 the Democrats were whipped worse

like an earthquake. Two years ago we car­

do the same this year. Bat I became a little
uneasy and did not ad vase any of my friends
to bet. But we are bound to beat them, and
why? Because the Democratic party is the

went his way as proud of his drees as a
donkey of its ears. ""
Setting spurs to bis horse, be soon
reached the gates of a splendid castle.
Some feast was taking place within.
The guests were all seated under a shady
bower deploring that they had been dis
appointed of the minstrels who were to
have played.
Bartolo, on learning this, advanced
to the bower, and after elegantly salut
ing the lord and lady of the castle in a
most refined voieo said:
""If it be right for a simple knight to
offer his services to such a distinguished
oompany of rank and beauty, I think I
could promise to provide what you are
requiring. ""
""Oh, do, at onoe, please!"" cried all
the ladies, who were longing to dance.
""Bluest of bluebirds, do your duty!""
said Bartolo.
Suddenly in the distance was heard
the noise of many feet and a troop of
musicians with their instruments ap­
peared, to the great delight of the com
pany.
The lord of the castle thanked the
stranger and desired him to open the
ball with his eldest daughter, a maiden
fair and lovely, like a snow bird.
When the ball was at its height the
birdcage maker ordered an elegant ban
quet to be served, during which the
bluest of bluebirds was cummanded to
sing nome songs, which wena very much
admired. Games of chance followed,
and Bartolo, taking advantage of his
good fortune, distributed among the
ladies pearls, bracelets and rings of pre
cious' stones. All those present were
surprised beyond measure because the
lord of the castle was known to be ex
tremely niggardly and mean.
The lord of the castle, who knew how
all this had been done through the
agency of the bird and being himself of
an inordinately avaricious nature,
thought be might do a fine stroke of
business were he to purchase the bird.
Hence, calling his unknown guest away
to ins study, be proposed to him to pur
chase the bird for what price he should
quote.
""You would never give me my price, ""
replied Bartolo.
""For it I would give my oastle, with
its nine forests,"" said the lord of the
cdstlo
""It is not enough."" N
""Very well, I will add my olive plan
tations and vineyards. ""
""That is 'still insufficient"" cried
Bartolo.
""I will add the orchards, gardens
and houses.""
""I want something elsa ""
""What still more? Why, man, you
must want paradise Itself. ""
""Not so. I want what you can give
me this very moment I want your
daughter with whom I danoed just now.
Iiet her be my bride. ""
"" What my daughter?"" cried the old
miser in an ecstasy of joy. ""By my
faith, -we shall soon conclude the bar-
cam. Why did yon not say so before?'
Hewent to seek the girl and told her
of the 'engagement he had entered into.
But his daughter, in utter amazement
cried cmt:
""But what if he is a wicked elf and

Taking her hand, he led her to the
stranger, who was .already on his horse,
and assisted her to mount behind her
future husband. Taking the cage with
the bluest of bluebirds, he watched the
retreating forms of the pair as the horse
carried them away swifter than the
wind, and when out of sight he pro­
ceeded to join his guests. The company
was all gathered in knots discussing the
extraordinary powers of the bird and
all the events which had taken place.
""Peaoe, peace!"" cried the lord of the
castle as he entered. ""I will perform
more marvelous things than ever he
did. I have given him my daughter to
we8 in exchange for the bird, and this
bluebird will render me more wealthy
than the king of Aragon. Approach and
see the wonders I will work with it. ""
He took the oage, and lifting it up to
look at the bird was astonished to find
that it was not blue at all, but a large
gray bird, which turned to stare at him
in an insolent manner, gave a florae
peck at the door of the cage with its
beak, flung it open and flew out of the
window, uttering a terrible screeoh. ,'.
The lord of tho castle stood with open
mouth, not knowing what to do or say.
His guests broke out in peals of laughter
at his discomfiture and the well deserv­
ed punishment for his unseemly avarice
of exchanging his beautiful daughter for
a worthless bird.

Serpents' Movements.
The serpent moves by elevating the
scales on its abdomen and using them
to push the body forward. The windings
are always horizontal. The artists who
represent the sinuosities as vertical have
never observed the animal in motion.
It is impossible for it to move in that
way.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84028297/1895-01-10/ed-1/seq-7,"","",7,"","",1,ohi_ingstad_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Democratic Northwest and Henry County news.,L.L.

As several very early examples of scolds'
bridles exist in Scotland the opinion ob­
tains that, like the maiden or guillotine,
this article of punishment may have been
of Scotch origin and then have gradually
made Its way southward. A brank of a
common type came to lignt In 1848 from
behind the oak paneling in the ancient
house of the earls of Moray, In Kdin
burgh. One that may be seen at Leicester
U somewhat simple in construction, and
to the back of It a chain about a foot in
length Is attached.
A very curious specimen Is preserved at
Newcastle, to which reference has been fre­
quently made, undone of the most curious
allusions to It occurs in Gardiner's ' (Eng­
land's Grievance Discovered In Relation
to the Coal Trade,"" printed In 1855, where,
on page 110, it states that John Willis of
Ipswich, when in Newcastle, saw a worn
an named Ann Hidlestoneled through the
streets by an officer of the corporation,
wearing a brank upon her head, the tongue
piece so forced into her mouth as to cause
j B to bleed. He adds, 'This Is the punish
ment which the magistrates do Inflict
I upon chiding and scolding women. "" John
I Willis also affirms that he has seen drunk
I ards puni-hed by being driven through the
j streets of the same town Inclosed In s

was known as the new fashioned cloak.""
I Among the many curious objects brought
together by that eminent antiquary, Klla*
Ash mole, and preserved a: Oxford U a
brank of the Ipm cruel type, Jn which the
tongue plate has been rounded at the end
to prevent the tongue from being injured.
In this specimen the leading chain is fas
ter.ed to the front of the Instrument im
mediately over the nose aperture.
An instrument which may also he

were.
The last time the scold's bridle was
publicly used in England was at C'ongle­
ton, in Cheshire, In 1824; but, In the
words of an eminent statesman, ""many
things hare happened since then,"" and It
would create no small sensation If at the
present time we were to meet a fin dc *t< cle
lady, led through the streets by a burly po­
liceman, wearing one of these uncouth Im­
plements, because, forsooth, she had v**n

whole rivers into the city to till its thou­

And between the aqueducts and the

Gold For Filling Tooth.
People, says a dentist, wonder why
gold Is used for stopping and are apt
to credit the dentist with employing it
for his own euds, on the ground that he
can charge more and get correfqiond­
lugl.v larger profits than would he the
case if he used any baser and less ex­
pensive metal; but, he says in explan­
ation. a little reflection would convince
the suspicious ones that there Is no
ground whatever for such Ideas, and
that the real reason for using gold is
that It will weld while cold nud will
successfully resist the action of tho
adds and fluids of the mouth, hence it
Is unequalled as a preservative for the
teeth.

couldn't sit still and my sufferings began to
make life look very blue. Two years ago
last September I noticed an account of Dr.
Williams' Pink Pilis for Pale People and
what they had done for others, and some
cases so nearly resemh.ed mine that I was
interested, so I wrote to one who had given
a testimonial, an eminent professor of musio
in Canada. The reply I received was even
stronger than the printed testimonial and it
gave me faith in the medicine.
""I began taking the pills and found them
to be all that the professor had told me they
would be. It was two or three months be­
fore I experienced any perceptible better­
ment of my condition. My disease was of
such longstanding that I did not expect
speedy recovery and was thankful even to
be relieved. I progressed, rapidly, however,
toward recovery and for the last six months
have felt myself a perfectly well man. I
have recommended the pills to many people
and am only too glad to assist others to
health through the medium of this wonder­
ful medicine. I can not say too much for
what it has done for me.""

EXCAVATING WITH WATER JETS.

Hngre Masses of Earth Now Easily
Removed by Aqueous Battering:
Rams.

Within the past ten or twelve years
the uses of hydraulic ""monitors"" and
""little giants,"" of California mining
fame, as means of earth excavation
have become pretty well appreciated
among engineers, says Cassier's
Magazine, and water jets have become
successfully applied to a variety oT en­
gineering purposes, for which only a
short time previously they would nev­
er have been thought of. Pile driving
with water jets now so common, is
only one modification of the general
method while the removal of heavy
earth banks by these aqueous batter­
ing rams is another which is deserved­
ly working its way into favor. What
has led to these reflections is a revis­
ed reversion, recently published, of
an account of the removal several
years ago of some river bluffs over­
hanging the tracks of one of the rail­
road lines in the western part of the
United States. This was accomplish­
ed almost wholly by the employment
of jets of water under high pressure,
bringing the cost of excavation down
to tho low figure of 1 1-2 cents per cu­
bic yard. It recalls also a neat job
carried out a few years ago In the
way of filling in a large area of land
just under water and bringing it up
to a level of several feet above the wa­
ter line. Large sand hills ranged along
the shore close by these hollows. The
work got into the hands of two old
California miners, who applied a modi­
fied hydraulic mining outfit to its exe­
cution. They bought a couple of large
pumps, which delivered water from
the bay on the tops of thtfvsand hills
through an iron pipe, and then, by
means of a series of boxes and sluices,
they carried tho dirt and sand which
the water washed down from the hills
out to the spot to be filled In this
way several acres of land were made
at an expense which was merely nom­
inal.^ The pumps and boiler were
practically worth as much after the
woi was done as when they were
first purchased handling of material
with additional cost there was none
and the whole operation was complet­
ed in a remarkably short space of
time.

w P E willows and elms
y had put forth little
i gray-green leaves, and

-mocking"" birds and cardinal grosbeaks
had mated for the season. The air was
warm and soft, and all Woodville was
-excited over the coining- Washing-ton
birthday celebration. There was to be
a procession of the military and civic
organizations, and the eloquent' young
lawyer, Ilowell Marton, of Richmond,
would deliver a eulogy upon the great
patriot and soldier.
There had been no commemoration
of the day since the war, and the Wood­
villeites felt that it reflected upon the
patriotism of g-ood Virginians to suffer
so important an event to go by unno­
ticed. All the neighboring towns mani­
fested a lively interest in the coming
ceremonies, which promised to be of
exceptional importance.
This is why old Mizraim Temple was
moving- about so restlessly over the
plantation of his former master, Col.
.lSlton Temple. The orator of the day
was to be the g-uest of the Temples,
-who lived but two miles from the vil­
lage, and Mizraim, who had loyally re­
mained upon the old place after eman­
cipation, felt that all the responsibil­
ities and duties of the coming event
j-ested upon his shoulders.
Old Mizraim, his wife Dinah, who
later passed to her reward, and his
daughter Piney were the only ones of
the old servants who. lived on with
their master, the hundreds of others
scattering- in every direction after they
were set free.
""Marser needs me, 'n' I ain' gwine;
nuther's you, Dinah.""
""Who done said I wuz?"" demanded
Dinah, indignantly. .
Piney grew up under her mother's
care, was, taug-ht all the mysteries of
lier skillful cookery and succeeded the
old woman when she died. Piney de­
pised the ""Lincoln-freed niggers,"" as
-she termed them, and as there were no
others thereabouts she had remained
single.
As Mizraim and Piney stood under a
""big magnolia that grew near the kitch­
en door, the old man scratched his gray
locks and said: ""Piney, huccum dey
xneck sich er f urse erbout Ginrul Wash­
in'ton's bufday?""
The daughter endeavored to explain
the part taken by the immortal hero in
the struggle for independence, conclud­
ing with:
""He was the Father of His Country,
paw.""
""De farder of all dis yere country, po
-white trash an' all? Den, lawsamussy,
ef I wuz him I'd be p'inted ershamed er

""Why, paw, he's been daid jamby er

""Glong, gal! Den white folks is

""It's to larn the livin' how good he

The old negro pulled off his some­
what battered hat and began to bow
nd scrape in acknowledgment of the
presence of a most beautiful and charm­
ing young woman, who smiled pleas­
antly upon him and his curtseying
daughter.
""Now, Uncle Mizraim, you know we
lo have to depend upon you. Can't you
get us some nice fish and game? You
know we shall have company on the

shall be pleasant and nice and am sure
you will make an extra effort to please

""Datter de way,"" grumbled Mizraim,
when the young lady had passed on.
""'Hit's Mizurm dis 'n Mizurm dat, n'

tering.""""La, paw 'ould be mis'able ef he

laughed Piney, as she entered her
realm.
Clton Temple was an old-school Vir­
ginia gentleman, whose blood was blue
as indigo and ran unsullied back to
noble lords in old England. He was
disposed to regard with great favor the
marked preference shown his daughter
y the gifted young lawyer who would
lc his guest in a day or two. Marton s
family was as ancient as his own and

more than once the blood of that line
had blended in marriage with that of
the Temples.
Col. Temple was a very proud, yet
a very worthy and upright man. He
had served the south faithfully during
its secession struggle, and at the close
of hostilities surrendered in good
faith, becoming obedient unto the
laws. Without repining he accepted
the results of battle, bearing up brave­
ly under the loss of negroes, stocks,
bonds, notes, depreciation in land val­
ues, etc., and resumed his planter life
under the changed conditions, dealing
justly by the freedmen as he formerly
had acted humanely to his slaves.
Washington was his apotheosis. One
of his male ancestors had married a
Washington and he gloried in the con­
nection. It was largely through his in­
fluence that the celebration of the hero's
natal day was determined upon, and it
was upon his advice-that young Marton
was chosen orator.
The colonel's creed was simple. He
accepted the orthodox faith, worshiped
the memory of his dead wife, adored
his only child, and held that the word
of a gentleman could not be broken.
He abhorred deceit and never forgave
it in anybody. Somewhatold-fashioned,
he believed in dueling, and
maintained strenuously that the law
was made only for the weak. He had
no patience with those who appealed
to the arbitrament of the courts. Still
he was a most gentle, quiet man who
never disputed, declined to take any
active part in politics, and entertained
with an easy grace that is the charm
of true Virginia hospita ity.
It was the evening of the day before
the 22d of February and the colonel
drove home from Woodville in excellent
spirits. Every arrangement had been
thoroughly completed and the weather
promised to be auspicious on the mor­
row. Before he entered the house old
Mizraim encountered him.
""Deed, marser, it do seem laick ebery­
t'ing tote f a'r fer us. De ice'ouse er
plum full er game 'n' fish 'n Piney's


WRESTED THE TTEAPOH
fro win' hersel away on de cookin'
an' hit looks somefin' laick de good ol
times afo' de wah, marser.""
This intelligence added to the good
humor of the all-hospitable master of
the house, whose handsome face was
covered over with a smile as he en­
tered the great hall of the noble
old colonial manor that his great­
grandfather had built. He was sur­
prised that Grace did not greet him ac­
cording to her custom, for he was sure
she must have heard his voice. ' Search­
ing anxiously about he found her in a
corner bathed in tears and sobr ing as
though her heart would break.
""Why, pet, what in the world is the
matter?""
Without uttering a word she placed
in his hands a Richmond paper and
pointed to a brief paragraph. His eyes
opened wide in astonishment as he
read:
""Cards are out for the wedding of
Howell Marton, Esq., the brilliant
young lawyer, and Miss Hattie. daugh­
ter of John W. Powell, the well-known
capitalist of the city.""
The father was silent for some mo­
ments as he stood over his idol, whose
hair he stroked gently. Finally he
asked, in unsteady tones:
""Did you care for him so much,
pet?""
""O father,"" cried the girl, passionate­
ly; as she threw her arms upward and
clasped them about his neck.
""Was there-Hlid he ask you to be his
wife?""
It was some time before the agita­
tion of the girl permitted her to speak.
Then she told him, as a weary child
making complaint to its mother, that
while no formal betrothal had taken
place she had every assurance of his
love and, indeed, it was his expressed
purpose to ask her hand in marriage
during the coming visit. She could not
understand his perfidy; she must not,
she could not doubt, yet there were
the words- in cold, cruel type.
""He is an unmitigated scoundrel,
and you must forget him, my child. .

large sprightly robin with the brilliant redbreast
breast of a male alighted on the swaying top of
a tall rigged hmlock that stands down back of
the Post Ofllce and began to tine a plaintive
thoughtful tone to a dullercolored bird across
the road the lower limb of Ho
on 1mb a maple 10 sang
In praise as a timid lover might but gaining
courage sang out louder and louder till In a
burst of beautiful melody he forgot his own
surroundings as lovers often do and saw only
the sweotheart with whom ho would mat­
A brown bird with long keen wing and hate­
ful speed flew along close to the briars along the
bank behind the unconscious singer With a
sharp swerve he rose I and then the sweet­
heart across the road piped a shrill note of
alarm and warning Just In time The lover
dived down turned harp and escaped th lit­
tle sparrow hawks talons and more cruel bill
But the hawk was not going to be cheated
outofaswoct meal thus He too turned and
pressed close after the fleeing robin It looked
as if the robin had bung his last song when the
hawk cut off I corner and came In not two feet
behind the robin 1 peering I Ineagernessfor
prey
tlldr l
The robin it a timid bird and a i­
on He fears the blackbird and hops away
from a bullying 1 sparrow rd hors area
a menace to his life I while cats and hawkdrive
him wildly away In fear Hut there comes a time
tle
when a robin pressed lard for life or whn his
home Is I In gnat dangerwlll fight as fwstraight
billed I birds cm flulit I anti drive ncowardBird
before him or kills a brave one So It was with
this one
Pressed close by a Qrce pursuer with death
and nothing beyond but everything to live for
he suddenly turned on his enemy and struck nt
him Struck full in the breast the surprised
hawk tumbled over backward and fell to the
ground Again the robin struck him on the
back before time hawk realized what had hap
pencil then ho turned and the two faced each
other The robin had lost his appearance of
fear and the hawk showed pain and fear Still
he attacked time lobln again
I h hnwl was a practised fighter Hit train­
ing had I led that way No bird unless sur­
prised and suddenly wounded yields without a
Icht Long combats with agile red nqtilrreln
blueja kingbirds and lesser ones had given
him the skill which only practice can give The
robins life had been different I had been a
peoioful starch for Insect and a life of song
nor had nature fitted him with such weapons as
lila opponent had on foot and head still the
straight bill was a good weapon I
Three times the two tackled each other
The robins breast became redder jet with
blood lime hawk had lot an eye The robins
tongue was bleeding and the hawks breast
Wi hleflnK was
scarred deep by the robins Hrst assault The
rebtim was the weaker and tho test was longer
than Im could stand but < he couldnotescape
for to turn to flee would be only to bring the
other onto his back so he fought dciperatdy
The fourth tackle he lost his hold and was
sinking hack pressed down by the hawk great
rr weight and superior strength I looked
darker linn for him Ho thought the sweet
heart on the maple limb the saw her lover
light and hopped alone the limb and back
again leaning forward eagerly and chirping en­
couragement to him Then when the robin be
can to weaken she sprang from the limb and
hovered over the two chirping fearfully
As the robin was sinking back exhausted to
fall an easy prey to the hawk she dived down
straight as ever a hawk dived and struck the
victor between the wings In the back It was n
death blow and when she anti her lover sat 1
the maple llinb tide by side I blood was onher
bill while the hawk lay I dead with abroken
back t bo picked up later by thetaxidermist

ABEZ WILSON,
whose fifty-two
years of life had
been passed in sin­
JT 1 e blessedness,
' had little in com-
mm rn V tltA Met
V of the world.
-st His faults were
many and his virtues few. His tworedeeming-
points call them virtues if
you will were generosity verginjr on
weakness in individual cases and a love
for music
Late one night he came out of St.
James' hall, buttoned his coat up round
his neck, dived his hands into his
pockets, and made for home. On his
way he entered a cafe and took a cup
. of coffee.
As he sipped the beverage his ear,
ever on the alert for music, caught the
sounds of a voice that was at once rich
and melodious.
Jabez listened attentively for five
minutes, during which time the song
continued with short intervals of si­
lence. At length it stopped altogether.
Jabez asked the waiter attending him
to fetcn in the person singing.
The waiter returned in less than a
minute ushering in a young man of a
distinctly Italian cast of countenance"",
whom he introduced as Luigi the bottle­
washer.""Well, my man, yon have an extreme­
ly fine voice. Did you know that? With
due care and rigid training there
ought to be both fame and fortune in
it. You would like to be something
better than a bottle-washer all your
life, eh, my man?""
Luigi, in a wondering sort of way,
nodded.
""That's right, that's right, my man.
Here is my card. Come and see me at
my house to-morrow at half-past six. I
waut to have a serious talk with you.
Can you come?""
""l es, sir that is, no, sir. Not to­
morrow. I work till eleven every night
during the week.
""Oh, oh! sneh is the irony of fate,""
muttered Jabez. ""Can you come on
Sunday?""
""Yes, sir, I will come.""
True to his word. Luigi, clothed in
his Sunday garments, found himself in
Mr. Wilson's drawing-room the follow­
ing Sunday evening.
""Luigi, you have a most charming
voice. It is, at present, in what I may
term an embryo form. The foundation
is there in all its strength, and a couple
of years careful training will place
you without a doubt in one of the top­
most branches of the vocal tree.
""You must make a point of cultivat­
ing your voice on every possible occa­
sion, Luigi. Avoid those articles of
food which I shall give you a list of,
that your vocal cords may retain the
sweetness, strength and fullness that
now marks them.
""Your clothes, too, are unsuited to
the pupil of a vocal professor. You
must fit yourself out like a gentleman.
Luigi. You must exercise care, and
take a pride in your personal appear­
ance in short, be in every respect
worthy of your profession.""
As Luigi's profession was that of
bottle-washer at an Italian restaurant,
he naturally failed to see how he could
well give further evidence of his occu­
pation than by the suit in which he ap­
jwared before this strange gentleman­
And he said so.
""Dear me; of course. I must explain
to you, Luigi, what I propose to do. I
am too hasty. First and. foremost, do
you like music?""
""I am an Italian,"" was the modest
reply.
""Grand. A most fitting answer.
Now we will come to business. Would
you like to give up your present
menial occupation and become, first,
tne pupil oi a musician, ana men a
master of the art you will excel in?""
'That is beyond my hopes, sir. I
have no money.""
Jabez Wilson threw up his hands.
""That's all right. I will see to that
little matter. Give me the assurance
that you will put your whole heart
into the work I have cut out for you.
and will do your best. 1 ask for noth
ing more.""
A few days later Luigi left his situa
tion, and became the protege of Mr.
Wilson. To say that Luigi was grate­
ful would be to put the feeling he
evinced toward his benefactor in very
""well, kt VATS, TOTT HATE as ex-
TREMELT FIIE VOICE.
mild terms. He could find no ""way of
expressing nis gratituae neyona matt­
ing himself as perfect in his art as it
became possible for him to do.
""Luigi,"" said Mr. Wilson one day,
I am delighted to tell you -that it is
now beyond the capabilities of English
masters to teach you further. It re­
mains for the masters of your native
land to instil into you that little re­
quired to render you their equal, if not
their superior. I have decided, there­
fore, to take you to Naples, where we
will spend the next year or two.""
For the first time since their odd ac­
quaintance, Luigi failed to hail an an­
nouncement for his benefit with any
ign of pleasure or satisfaction. He
looked gloomy and hesitated to speak.
""You have always been extremely
kind and good to me, Mr. Wilson. 1
cannot - by any possible means express
my gratitude. But the suggestion you
have made, although entirely for my
good, fills me with pain. I cannot
leave England, because because I am
Koing to get married.""
""The dickens you are!"" roared the

1 was. Luigi was only flesh and blood,

and young blood at that.
""Luigi,"" he began, after the silence
of the moment, is this girl of yours a
suitable partner to accompany you on
your upward career through life? You
will stand at the head of your art, and
you will move in the highest circles of
European society.
""She, whatever her post in life now,
may be ill-fitted to grace the drawing­
room of the aristocracy, or to sit by
your side in the carriage that draws
you to your mansion.
""You love her now she is every­
thing to you. Time may be, however,
when you may be led to make odious
comparisons between her simplicity
and the winning faces of beautiful
women.""
""My kind benefactor, that is impos­
sible. I shall always love Maggie as
much as I do now.""
Jabez Wilson sighed. It was a sad
blow to his vanity and to his peace of
mind.
""Think it over, lad,"" he began.
""When the first pangs of erief at part­
ing are passed, you will forget about
your lowly girl in the whirlwind of
your fame, and she will soon put you
from her mind. Come to me to-morrow
and let me know what you intend
doing.""
The next day Mr. Wilson received
a visit from Maggie. She came in tears
to beg his consent. Ilis heart was
touched at the sight of a woman in
sorrow, and. reviling himself for a cold­
blooded monster, he told her, in an
outburst of generosity, to go and
marry Luigi as many times as she
liked.
After a twelvemonth spent in Italy
Luigi became perfect. Ilis firs; ap­
pearance in public was made in Ger­
ardo, and, as he retreated behind the
curtains that night, old Jabez Wilson
waited to press his hands and to tell
him that his dream was at last rea­
lized.Jabez Wilson walked out of his so­
licitor's office penniless. The bank of
which he was principal shareholder
had failed, and this, in conjunction
with a few minor disasters, had robbed
him of every penny he had possessed.

of work, and was not even capable of
a clerical position.
The apartments he had occupied were
given up; the club was never again to
see him or hear what had become of
him; the fine old wines in his cellar
fetched sufficient to pay bislong-standing
rent, with a surplus to keep h.m
in food and lodgings for a few weeks
that was all.
From his scanty store he drew a
penny every day to search the papers
for news of Luigi's success. He could
not bring himself to write to him and
to tell him every thin g.

Two B!etl Made It, but Another Follow
Clot I'alil For It.
Tito managing editor of a now dead
nnd forgotten newspaper was an admirer
of humor. Wit hour a spark of it in his
own composition, ho had learned in his
long newspaper oxporieuco that n ju­
dioion8 injection of wit and fancy mailt*
o paper popular. Ho learned the lesson
earlier than the other editors in the
town, ami his was tho first paper to en?
liven its pages with bits of humor. Tho
""old man"" recognized his own incapac?
ity in the matter of jokes. He knew that
thousands laughed at things that seem?
ed foolish and Hat to him. When ho
started using humorous matter, ho hired
u young man to supervise tho prepara?
tion and publication of thestulf. Know?
ing absolutely nothing about jokes and
jokers, ho employed a man who had
made a reputation among other peoplo
by his work on an eastern funny paper.
Tho young man had a brilliant i<loa.
He offered a reward of $2.50 for every
original joke brought in by members of
tho stuff. Tho ""old man"" backed him
up?nothing was too expensive if it sold
papers. The result of the prize offer was
a remarkable outpouring of alleged wit.
One in IUI caught tho fever the first day.
Timidly ho went to tho professional
humorist.
""Do you buy jokes here:"" ho asked.
Tho humorist took the proffered pa?
per from tho new mau's hand und read
it. ""Yes,"" ho said, and handed back tho
paper.
Tho newcomer retired crestfallen.
Immediately following this passage at
arms Frank Walsh, tho best hearted fel-""
low in the offlco, scribbled a few lines on
a sheet of paper and handed it to tho
professional humorist. Without a word
the latter wroto out an order on tho
cosher for $2.50. Tho other members
of tho staff wondered at tho occurrence,
and watched the paper for the appear?
ance of tho joke. It was not published,
and after a feW days the boys began to
ask about tho witticism the editor had
paid for and did not use. Finally Walsh
told them what it was. Here it is:
""Young Man (handing paper to edi?
tor)?Do you buy jokes In r. i?
""Editor (returning paper)?Wo do. ""

genial looking citizen to place his

with an inward qualm, lest his own ab?

""Yon can take your choice, sir,""said
tho lady in search of sin escort, and ho
promptly did so by tucking tho arm of
tho younger fair one under his own and
leading her into the car. The couple

Whimsical Father Seliaubel.
Father Schaubcl, who died a few
years ago, was well past his eightieth
year. Ho was another dead in earnest
Christian. A good many years ago his
workmen, while hauling earth from oiio
of his lots, encroached ou one of mine,
und I spoke to him about it. He. threw
up his hands in a surprised way and
exclaimed, ""Tho whole earth is made
of dirt, and shall wo quarrel about a
wheelbarrow load <if itx"" Ho had a
strong German accent. A short time ho­
foro he died I mot him on tho street and
said. ""Well, Father Seliaubel, how do
yon lind yourself:"" ""1 find mysolf ncJi­

how do yon like it."" ""Ach, vidi, vo

maxim with him, tobe satisfied?that

year there was, lor some reason, a great
scarcity of tomatoes, and lie had a huge
crop. In reply to a question what ho
was getting lor them, he replied: ""Two

MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
—When the Dutch destroyed a!! the
clove trees on the Termite islands sev­
eral diseases never known before in
that region appeared and became epi­
demic.
—The pure white lotus is the -oyal
flower of Siam and is always bdrne be­
fore the king in state processions. J-'or
a subject to carry one or have one
carried before him is high treason.
—The colored people living in Berlin
held a festival in that city recently
which attracted many of the prominent
people of the capital. One of the best
speakers made an address, as became a
good adopted citizen, in eulogy of the
German emperor. Negroes in the fa­
therland have reason to be content with
their lot. They are said to be received
on an equality with whites, and are
often called “brunettes.”
—The restriction that no member of
another feminine patriotic association
may join the order of the Daughters
of the Cincinnati has been removed, and
the society’s doors are now open to ail
eligible candidates. The membership
now numbers 40, while many papers of
new candidates are in course of exami­
nation. There is a long waiting list,
end the number of applications aver­
ages eight daily. Of late many Balti­
moreans have joined, indicating south­
ern interest in the new organization.
—-The nerves of warm-blooded ani­
mnls telegraph information to their
brains at the rate of about 150 feet per
second. When anyone puts his hand
on hot iron he doeß not feel it until the
nerves have sent the message to the
brain, and in the interval his band has
been burned. It is thought that this
would not lie the case if the nerve mes­
sage were transmitted with the inten­
sity and velocity of electricity trans­
mitted over a copper wire to a bitiin act­
ing with the promptness of a Leyden
jar.
—Food, to be properly digested,
should be well and thoroughly cooked.
The process of cooking promotes cer­
tain necessary chemical changes, and
destroys a prolific source of disease.
Food and drink frequently contain
poisons which the long-continued ap­
plication of heat will reader innocuous.
The practice of recommending raw or
partially cooked meats is especially
bad. Such food is a heavy tax upon the
digestive organs, and often nets as a
carrier for the virus of infectious dis­
eases.
—The average foreigner’s ignorance
of things American was brought home
to a traveler in Madrid this summer,
who was strolling through the streets
of that city in company with a Spanish
gentleman of excellent education. The
two passed an inn on whose sign-board
vver painted the words: “Casa Washing­
ton.” The Spaniard pointed it out to
his companion. “Ah, we think so much
of your Washington!” he said. “He
was the greatest man of our country.”
The American at once felt th’p correct
thrill of patriotic pride. “Yes,” con­
tinued the other, meditatively, “his
books on Spain are a delight, and his
career here as minister made him to be
admired by all.” The American caught
his breath, but wisely did not under­
take to disabuse his friend of the im­
pression that the greatest American
was Washington Irving.
FIGHT WITH TWO LIONS.
Hairbreadth Escape from the Clutches of
a Hungry iteast.
He saw, above the ledge and a little
beyond, the ears and head of a lion as it
sat watching the deer. Jake rose in
his saddle to place a bullet, as he said,
midway between those ears, when n
powerful lion leaped from behind a tree
on the ledge of rock above and, striking
him in the ehest.earried him off his horse,
headlong down the mountain, and his
horse ran wildly away. A moment later
Jake was lying on his back in the snovy
his head up hill and the beast standing
over him with one paw planted firmly
on his chest, the other slightly lifted,
and wagging its tail in delight, while
its hot breath was exhaled into Jane’s
face.
His first impulse was to hold down his
chin tightly, to prevent his throat be­
ing torn open, while he cautiously felt
for his knife. He found the knife and
as he drew it a slight grating sound
caused the lion to rebound at his feet
and as it did so it uttered a scream
w'nicli Jake knew only gave him the
chance of a moment. It was a call for
the other lion. Fearing to make a
motion of escape or resistance he moved
his hand back in the snow in search of
his rifle, which hail been lost in the fall.
His finger touched the stock. He cau­
tiously pulled it down by his side and
still looking his captor straight in the
eyes slowly turned the rifle till its
muzzle faced the lion. The bullet passed
through its heart and it sank on Jake's
feet. Before he could move from his
helpless position the other lion bounced
over the precipice and somewhat over­
leaping its mark lit in the snow and in­
stantly received a bullet in its brain.
The two lions lay dead not ten feet
apart.—Outing.
Dnlicion* Innocence.
At Darlington recently a minister’s
little daughter was attending her first
church service. .She had never seen her
father in the pulpit before, and on his
entrance there her presence of mind
forsook her and she piped out in a voice
expressive of recognition: ""Why,
there’s my papa up there in that box!”
Avenging propriety swept down upon
the little maiden, and for a season there
was a great culm. Hut the service was
grievously long to such a wee worship­
er, and she became very restless, walk­
ing up and down the pew and sighing
audibly. “It won’t be long, dear.”
nii'.minu whispered. Whereupon en­
sued another brief period of quiet, but
it was not to last. Tired baby nature
hud reached its utmost limit of endur­
ance, and by and by over the quiet lis­
teners arose a little voice, clear and
plausible and coaxing, ► “Isn’t you
nearly done, pupa?” Loudon Tele­

Iks About Ills Deliverer Dully
\ln  Gratitude— Fifteen
; Pounds in Weight Since II:*­
--' Hl'Hl'Uf.
URBANA.. Ohio.—(Special.) - This
town Is greatly exercised over the re­
markable rescue of Sheriff R. P. Wil­
kins from one of the worst forms of
slavery known to man. He has now
fully recovered from the results of his
experience, and talks freely and grate­
fully of his deliverer. In an Interview j
to-day he said: ""I have been a perfect j
slave to tobacco for over twenty-five
years; I smoked from twelve to fifteen
cigars a day. November 4th, . last, I !
bought my first box of No-To-Bac from
Anderson & Cramer. I had little faith,
and to my great surprise, after using
part of the third box, I was completely
.cured.and did not have the least de­
sire for tobacco. To-day I feel better,
I [sleep* better, think better, and I
have gained fifteen pounds In weight,
and there Is not a day passes that I
do not recommend No-To-Bac to many
of the tobacco users who I know are
destroying their lives and vitality by
the use of the weed.""
Further investigation revealed the
fact that there are 500 people living in
this town and the surrounding country
who have been cured by vNo-To-Bac.
Anderson & Cramer stated that they
were the first to start the good work
here, as Mr. Anderson termed it. ""Yes,
we introduced No-To-Bac into this j
town about three years ago. The de- I
•mand at the start was very light, the i
folks had no faith in It, but we sold !
to a few people, and to our great as- •
tonishment every one reported a cure.
Since that time we have sold hundreds
of boxes, and every one under a guar­
antee to cure or refund the money, and j
strange as It may seem, we have never
had a call to refund money.""
No-To-Bac not only relieves the ner­
vous irritation and makes the use of
tobacco entirely unnecessary, hut at
the same time builds up and fortifies
the general physical condition. As a j
natural invigorator and stimulant we I
believe there is no preparation in '
America to equal It.
""The public should be warned, how­
ever, against the purchase of any of
the many imitations on the market, as
the success of No-To-Bac has brought ;
forth a host of counterfeiters and imi­
tators. The genuine No-To-Bac Is I
made by the Sterling Remedy Co., Chi- |
cago, Montreal and New York, and Is i
sold under a guarantee to cure by all '
druggists, and every tablet ha« the I
word No-To-Bac plainly stamped !
thereon.""","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059522/1895-12-25/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,mnhi_sebeka_ver01,"","","",true,ca,St. Paul daily globe.,St. Paul Globe Print.

HER FIRST REHEARSAL

Mary Anderson de Navarro Tells of the
Preliminaries of Her Stage Debut.
In writing of her first appearance on
the stage Mary Anderson de Navarro
tells in The Ladies' Home Journal that
the opportunity to play was presented
her by Manager McCauley at his Louis­
ville theater. The star who was playing
at the theater had failed to attract pay­
ing houses, and Dr. Griffin, who was
Mrs. de Navarro's stepfather and her
business manager suggested to Mr. Mc­
Cauley that she be given a chance to
play. The offer was gladly accepted, and
Mrs. de Navarro writes that there was
only one rehearsal, and it was called for
the next morning. ""On my way to the
cathedral,"" she adds, ""I was enchanted
to see posters on the fences making the
announcement. The main part of the
poster was devoted to advertising Milnes
Levick in 'The Spy,'and at the bot­
tom in smaller typo the show bill read:
""Saturday Evening, Nov.27,1875.—Miss Mary
Anderson, a young lady of this city, will make
her first appearance on any stage as Juliet, in
Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet Milnes
Levick as Mercutio, and a powerful cast of
characters.
""As I was in the quiet church tho
hour for rehearsal struck, and I started
for the theater in a radiant frame of
mind. Passing with my people through
the darkened house and private boxes
covered with their linen dusters, I found
myself for the first time upon the stage.
How strange and dreamlike it sremed,
that empty theator, lighted only here
and there by the faint glimmer of tho
gray day without, bereft of all the eager
faces it had always bften peopled with!
And the stage 1 Eow dismal it was with
the noisy patter of the rain on its tiu
roof, a small gas jet burning in the cen­
ter,.throwing a dingy light on tho men
and women (they did not relish the ex­
tra rehearsal), gloomily standing in the
wings. On seeing me, all looked sur­
prised. Some made remarks in whispers,
.vhich I felt to be unkind others laughed
audibly. Scarcely 16, my hair in a long
braid, my frock reaching to my boot
tops, tall, shy and awkward, I may
have given them cause for merriment,
but it was.as cruel, I thought, as under­
bred, to make no effort to conceal their
mirth at my expense. However, their
rudeness was salutary in its effect, put­
ting me on my mettle before the work

Keeping Employees Honest.
""Distrust probably makes taoro
thieves than were ever evolved by the
laws of heredity,"" said a gentlomaii re­
cently who has a business in which he
employs a large number of men, all
holding positions in which the element
of trust is peculiarly great. ""In my
business I always make my men under­
stand that I have the utmost confidence
in them, and the result of this has been
that I have never had an employee ex­
hibit the least dishonest trait.
""Put.a man on his honor and make
him know that he is not being watched,
but being trusted, and he will raroly,
unless disposed to it by heredity, steal.
Of course some men are bor^ thieves
and should never be trusted. Tuey steal
becausfe the influence is too great for
them to resist. Often surrounding a
man with all sorts of devices and sys­
tems to prevent him from stealing has
the effect of causing him to look out for
a way of beating the bank. We aro all
strangely susceptible to that much talk­
ed of .force, suggestion—more than we
appreciate—and when the very environ­
ment in which we work suggests dis­
honesty every minute it is not much
wonder that it has a very positive effect
upon the mind in causing it to think
dishonestly.''—Pittsburg Dispatch..

have included lemurs, an ichneumon,
squirrels, doves, owls, tortoises and so
on. Squirrels and birds she has lured
from the woods and won their affection
by kindness, and in addition to giving
many particulars about these she has
something to say about studying nature,
teaching children to be humane and the
pleasures of insect observation, etc.
That insects can discriminate between
friends and enemies is, she holds, true,
and she remembers once in a country
village seeing a man hard at work
thrashing corn in a barn, and quite near
to him there was an immense hornets'
nest hanging from a beam. When asked
if he was not afraid of them, he smiled
and said: ""Oh, they know me well
enough. One of 'em fell inside my shirt
the other day, but he was very ceevil
and never stung me, for I never inter­
feres wi' them, and they never inter­
feres wi' me.""—Westminster Budget.

OFFERS GOLD FOR SILVER.
Open Letter From n Gold Mine Owner to
President Cleveliin:!.
New York, Jan. 6. The World
today says: Stephen H. Emmons,
who is president of a gold min­
ing company at No. 1 Broadway, has sent
an open letter to President Cleveland
offering a unique plan for maintaining
the gold reserve. He Baid in part:
""If the secretary of the treasury will
put himself in communication with
the owners of gold mines through­
out the country he can
cause the entire gold production of the
United States to be placed at the disposal
of the government in exchange for sil­
ver coin. So far, at any rate, as the
mines which I personally possess
or direct are concerned,
1 am willing to undertake
that through the output gold a very con­
siderable amount shall thus be dealt
with; and there cannot be any doubt of
every American gold mining corporation
being ready to do the same.
""The assistance thus obtainable by the
government will not involve any bond
issue, and will not saddle the nation with
any interest charge or syndicate remun­
eration.""It will add to the volume of home cur­
rency at the same time that it will equal­
ly increase the amount of international
currency in the treasury.""
TO SEE HIS PARENTS.

above all other questions of policy, we are
in favor of restoring to the people of the
United States the time-honored money of
the ConstItution-gold and silver, not one,
but both-the money of Washington and
Hamilton and Jefferson and Monroe and
Jackson and Lincoln, to the end that the
American people may receive honest pay
for an honest product; the American debtor
pay his just obligations in an honest stand­
ard and not in a standard that is appre­
ciated 100 per cent above all the great
staples of our country; and to the end fur­
ther that silver standard countries may be
deprived of the unnatural advantage they
now enjoy in the difference in exchange
between gold and silver-an advantage
which tariff legislation alone cannot over­
come.
We therefore confidently appeal to the
people of the United States that, leaving
in abeyance for the moment all other ques­
tions, however important, even momentous.
they may appear, and sundering if need
be all former party ties and affiliations,
that they unite in one supreme effort to
free themselves and their children from the
domination of the money power-a power
more destructive than any which has ever
been fastened upon the civilized men of any
race or in any age. And upon the con­
summation of their desires and efforts we
invoke -the gracious favor of Divine Provi­
dence.
Great Enthusiasm.

HIS IDEA OF A SHARK.
The Boy Had Head About the Fish and
Jetted HU Ideas Down.
An examiner of lads under 16 fox the
civil service commission gave for a question,
""Describe the habits of fish."" Here
is a literal transcript of one out of a
batch of some hundreds of answers:
""The shark is about 20 feet long and
has five rows of teeth whets the shark is
going to catch its pray it turns on its
side. The sharks are found in Indiad,
where they are vcrry numerous in Africa,
etc. The way they catch sharks is
lowering a pieco of meat on a sharp
hook (and sailers will do it for amusement),
and the shark is very hungry always,
that he Will grab at the meat and
find himself caught.

""un oi nis ices are tne sora nsn is
will go and rtln its sword through its
stummick.
""When the shark has been floating
about on the water for sometime it gets
a lot of small fish in its mouth and they
will go and lay on the beach and let
small birds come in their mouth and
pick them off and will not heart them.
The shark can live in water and on land.
Going from England to Indiad, you will
see sharks in the nile, they will follow
ships for many miles on purpose to get
some meat, and then perhaps not get
any. They are different kinds of sharks,
the Black shark, Etc.
""The shark is a very curious animal,
it can lay its teeth down when not
catching any food.
""Once upon a time thero was a ship
goiDg to america, and on board some
slaves the slaves were pack so close together
that they could not live, and the
captin of the ship yous't to let some
come upon deck, and many of the slaves
yous't to jump overboard, and be eat
with sharks, so the captin determined to
stop it if he could. So one day a black
slave woman was just in the acted to
jump overboard when the captin caugnt
her, and had had as many slaves as he
could get upon deck. And then he had a
rope fastened around her wast, and lowered
her overboard, wen a shark came
and bitt a half off her off, and then the
captin had the other half pulled up and
sown to the slaves on deck, and then
cnirt to thpm that, htt would do anv one

of them the same way if the jumped
overboard.""?Londcu Church Times.
Undignified For % StatesmanIt
is said that a woman remembers a
man whom she has known well as a little
boy always as the iittle boy and never
can think of him as grown up. This
saying seems to be borne out to a certain
extent at least by an amusing story told
in connection with the appointment of
M. Edouard Lockroy as minister of marine
in France.
When M. Lockroy was a small boy,
his father lived in a house in the street
in Paris which now bears the name Rue
Washington. His home was in the fifth
story of this building, and it appears
that he had certain habits which rendered
him objectionable to some of the other
residents of tho building, particularly
to the concierge, or woman who looked
out for the door. He found, fcr instance,
a more expeditious way of coming down
from the fifth floor than by tho stairs.
This excellent woman is still living.
When she beard that Edouard Lockroy
had become a minister, she threw up
her hands in astonishment and exclaimed
:
""What! That little Edouard Lockroy!
And to think of his always sliding down
from the fifth story of the palace cf the
Elyeeo on the balusters!""?Youth's

From a Financial Point of View.
""I beg your pardon,"" said the man

with the slightly bald head who eat in
a parquet seat near one of the boxes in a
down town theater the other evening.
""I beg your pardon,"" he repeated, ""but
wonld yon mind looking at the figures
on this check and telling mo what they
are? I'm a little nearsighted. ""
The youngest member of the noisy box
party, an amiablo looking youth with
highly plastered hair, suspended his
conversation with the interesting blond
in the green dress a moment, leaned
over the front of the box, and in answer
to the questioner, who had risen to his
feet and was smilingly holding out for
his inspection the check end of a ticket,
he said:
""Certainly, sir. The figures are
$1.50.""
""Well,"" rejoined the questioner,
""that's exactly what I paid to hear this
play tonight, and I'm going to get the
worth of my money, or I'll lift my

chairman ""of the national committee
of the silver party, has issued the
following address to the people:
As chairman of the national committee, ap-
pointed by the silver conference lately as-
sembled in Washington city to organize the
silver forces in these United States, in the i
battle which Is to take place for the pos- j
session of the government this year, it is •.
thought proper that I should make some state-
ment to ' the people In reference to it. .
As the necessity of money as a medium of
exchange became revealed to the minds of ,
men, the two metals finally accepted as the !
| most suitable for money were silver and gold. I
I This was natural because they were the two :
most precious metals adapted to the. purpose ]
; and were sufficiently limited as to quantity. !
As mining has developed the fact that these
two metals existed in the earth in almost
certain proportions, a natural ratio of value !
was assumed. This ratio has continued as ar- I
ranged by man under the natural order as he j *
found it. It was accepted by mankind as a i
part of the grand plan upon which the world j
was to move, and approved by the philosophy !
and common sense of all ages. From this con- |
dition of regular order and contentment, con- \
tributing to the gradual elevation of all classes
Of society, the extension of civilization and
the general betterment of the human race, this
country and the world has been ruthlessly
torn. It has been done by the rejection of one
of the precious metals in the interests of greed,
and by this act the money changers have been
enthroned and the narrowing of the scope j
of monetization begun. As monetization has
been narrowed, money has become scarcer in
proportion and as money became scarcer !
prices fell in proportion, and falling prices
have been the bane of this world. It was pre- j
dieted after the demonetization of silver that
great suffering would follow. This suffering
is already here. From a contraction of the !
currency, we are now in the throes of one !
of these desperate stages of human experience,l :
a period of heartache, canker and sleepless j
nights as the"" foundation - of prices have
crumbled. The country is confronted by a
grave emergency. Obligations. resting upon
the supposed firm foundation of a price in |
ready money have crumbled Into dirt as the

AUSTRALIAN BEE HUNT.
How the Natlres Etna the Weil-filled
Hires. - "" : j
An Australian savage comes up to
ah Irishman's idea of human skill, for
""he bates the bees. A native seldom?
fails, to get honey when he discovers
the beehe has been wathching for. The
following description of a native's bee;
h unt is given in llr. Arthur's ""Kangaroo
and Kauri:"" A
Warruyallah, the chief of a ' tribe,
went with two little netso a small-pool,
filled his mouth with water, and then
lying down, 'his head hanging overthe
pool, he remained ' quiet lor an hour
apparently looking at his own reflection'
in the water. Then, the hum of a bee
was heard. Buzz-z-z it went over he.
pool, round.theb lack's head, now omone
side, now on the other, and now close
to his ear; but not a motion betrayedj
the bee hunter. .
But when the bee, dropping close to
the water, gave notice by the change of
its tune that it was about to sip, thet
chief, with a snort, squirted the water
from his mouth over the little ""buzzer.""
Before it had time to recover from the,
unexpected douche, he seized it dex
teriously by the wings
Then he prepared it for the chase by,
fastening to, it a bunch of wild cotton;
with soma gum. The bee was let go; it
made for its hive, slowly at first on ac
count of its novel burden, which fan--
peded its progress and showed a sign in;
the air for the chief to follow. Oven
bramble and brake went the chief, 'ac
companied by the men of his tribe, and
m half an hour halted at the foot of an
immense gum tree, into whose top thej
bee naa gone.
The chief mounted quickly, by cutting
notches into the bark with his stone'
tomahawk. In a short time he.brought:
down a quantity of honevcomb.-a small'
piece only of which, contained honey.j

NOT THE SAME.
Beranger's Terse and Clever Character:
lzation of Victor Hugo.
A terse, and clever characterization
was that by which Beranger, the poet.
summed up Victor Hugo's relation to
the great republican spirit of France.'
Hugo, although it is said that he wasnot.
a republican at the very beginning of his
career, became a most enthusiastic and
outspoken one. He represented thepic-
torial, dramatic side of popular f eelin
and became so picturesque a figure in'
French politics that he could not have
failed to serve as a popular idol.
Beranger, who was a republican of the
simplest type, . notwithstanding his
share in establishing Bonis Philippe on:
the throne, denied the poet's attitude in
one line. 1
One day, says the Contemporary Re
view, shortly after the revolution which
overtoppled that throne, an acquaint­
ance of Beranger met him coming out
of r the Palais-Bourbon. T shall feel
obliged,"" said the poet, ""if you will see
me home, for I do not feel at ail well.
Those violent scenes inside there are not
to my taste. I am not at all well,"" he.
continued, with a wistful smile; ""I have­
been accused of having held the plank
over which Louis Philippe went to the
Tuileries. I wish I could be the bridge
across the Channel on which he would
return. Certainly I would have liked a:
republic, but not such as we are having,
in there."" - 1
He pointed to the home of the Con­
stituent assembly. . "" You ought to be'
pleased,"" said his friend. ""Victor Hugo
is in the same regiment with you.""
""Victor Hugo is not in theregiment,""j
was the quiet . reply. ""He is in the;
band.""-
PICKED UP IN THE
STREET.
a. Blacksmith Finds Bis
Tool to Be a
Nugaret of PruA Gold.
Curious things sometimes happen in
the gold bearing regions of the north­
west. The Blackfoot (Idaho) News tells
of a somewhat remarkable experience
which occurred to a blacksmith at that
town lately.
: The smith, whoso name is Farmer, had,
in his shop a grindstone which he wished,
to ""taper off."" For this purpose a small;
stone was requisite. So he went out of
doors and made search for a stone of the
right size and shape.- v ;
He found one somewhat smaller than
a hen's egg, and returning to vhis shop,
began to smooth down the edge of the
grindstone with it. He had not
""smoothed long before he thought that
the stone worked rather queerly, and
was, in fact, too soft to grind the stone. '
He took it to his anvil and broke it in
half, and then he found, that he. had.
picked up a nugget of pure gold.
Unfortunately, it was. a rather small
nugget. He sold it for $5.82 cents, and;

HAVANA, April 24, 1896.—Official ad­
vices received here state that Colonel
Aldea while in pursuit of parties of rebels
encountered several bands of them on the
Carmen estate, near Sabanilla, in the
Province of Matanzas. The insurgents
were fleeing from an attack which had
been made upon them by the Rey column.
The troops charged upon the rebels upon
all sides, forcing them to take refuge in
the cane fields, which were burning
fiercely, and many of them perished in
the flames which they themselves had
started.
The troops continued pursuit of the flee­
ing rebels, killing many of them. Twenty­
three dead insurgents were left behind.
* - is ev-ed that more than that
number perished in the cane fields. Other
v-ro. eminent autnorities assert that
the affair was similar to many others
which have occured wherein unarmed
men were killed. The official report says
that the troops had one man killed and
one wounded.
Colonel Prances reports that the rebels
fired upon the rear guard of his line near
Mariel, but retreated as soon as the
troops returned the fire.
Captain Madina Lajas, with a force of
guerillas, together with the forces of
• Vizcaya, dislodged the enemy from the
estate of Estrella, near Cienfuegos, of
which the Spanish troops took possession.
The rebels lost twelve killed and the
troops lost one wounded.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87068097/1896-04-24/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,njr_horseradish_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Jersey City news.,City Pub.

T""orty miles east of Charleston at Cot­

men attempted to hold up Washington
and Cincinnati express train last mid­
night.Tlioy boarded the train at Thurmond
and crawled over the tender of the en­
l; i : t e into the cab with revolvers drawn.
'i""ne en'ioerT stopped the train and he
was commanded to cut loose the ex­
press car. This was dnn', but by this
Hint alt the passengers were awake and
the lights were extinguished. After ten

which was to the last degree gloomy. Be­
cause of the inactivity of my liver, I could
not eat anything that would agree with me,
and, to add to nry already intense suffering,
inflammatory rheumatism got me in its grip.
It was dreadful. No one can imagine what
agonies I suffered. In this condition I be­
came as helpless as a babe, for I could not
rake a hand. I was considered to he on the
verge ot the grave, and I despaired of my
life.
""Deliverance came in this way: Through
the iniiuence of Mr. J. M. Foster, a friend
of mine, I was induced to give Dr. Wil­
liams' Pink Pills for Pale People a fair trial.
The result was simply marvelous. Within
two weeks after I began takiug the pills, a
marked improvement in my condition was
to be noted. I steadily continued to im­
proTC until I reached my present state of
good health. The hand of death was stayed
for the time being, and the grave cheated of
its victim.
"" All praise is due to Dr. Williams' Pills.
Surely I gave them a fair trial, for I used
forty dollars (S4O) worth of them and ought
to know whereof I speak. I doubt not that
the name of Dr. Williams will rank amoDg
the foremost of the greatest benefactors of
the age.
"" This is submitted to sick and suffering
hnnianity.""
These cases will not soem so remarkable
if a body remembers that it is stated by men
!of science that the entire human body is re-
I newed once in every seven years. It is in­
| teresting to inquire how this can be accom­
plished. Of course, it is readily understood
that the work of disintegration and decay
goes steadily on, but how are the wasted
particles resupplied? Jt is by means of the
j circulation of the blood. All the nourish­
: ment which is taken into tiie stomach is,
after digestion, received by the blood and
I carried to every organ, tissue and fibre in
; the body. This is a most important office,
i and it is important that the blood which is
to do this work should be pure, rich and
healthy. Otherwise it will not only be un­
able to fulfill its mission properly, but it
111 scatter disease throughout the' system.
Indeed, it is from impure blood that a
great majority of diseases originate, aud it
jis only by making the blood pure that they
can be cured. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for
Pale People possess a buildin£-up strength­
giving power which make them just the
medicine for those who find themselves in
a weak and run-down condition, cither as a
; result of illness or because of impure or im.
! poverished blood.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are not looked
upon as a patent medicine, but rather as a
prescription. An analysis of their properties
show that they contain, in a condensed form,
all the elements necessary to give new life and
richness to the blood and restore shattered
nerves. They sre an unfailing specific for
euch diseases as locomotor ataxia, partial pa­
ralysis, St. Vitus' dance, sciatica, neuraljria,

The o'.ht r roads do not seem to le fall­

reduced rates have started the corn to

this traffic forms the chief part of the

Yellow Fever Much Worse In Havana Than

Xew Yokk, Au:.-. 18. Health Officer
Alvan II. Doty, of this city, returned
from Havana, Cuba, yesterday. He
found that there was a great deal of
vcllovv fever and small-pox iu Havana
and the surroundingcountry. The san­
itary conditionsarc terrible. The whole
city's sewage, he say, is emptied
into the bay, and the tide is not suffi­
cient to carry it to sea. Consequently,
the bay i, he say, a constant breeder
of yellow fever, especially around the
Kigna docks and military hospital. He
is confident that the condition of the

ordinary summers, as the presence of
unacclimatcd soldiers has a very bad
effect.

I Down hi Alabama they tell a strange story
about a man who succeeded In cheating the
gallows by a clever ruso. As he lived a ro­
pcctable llfo afterward, and somo of Ids chil­
dren am still living, his real namo Is not given
Wo will call him Iecroux,
William Dercreux was a rising young law­
yer of good faintly, married to an accom­
plished wlfo, and possessed of a lnrge number
of admiring nnd doroted friends. Indeed, ho
was ono of those magnetic persons, hating the
fortunato facult) of making strong and loal
Irlonils ot nearly all who came in contact
with him.
But In the town whero he lived there was
considerable dissipation ot a certain kind,
Dovercux became a member ot a choice circle­
ot card plavers. He lost monoy of othtn
with which he had been Intrusted. For a long

time ho managed to keep this state of affairs
concealed by a sort of n, system of rob'jlng
Peter to pay Paul and to mcot his obligations
as thoy nurtured. Rut a porlod cutis when
William Devercux realized that thoso things
could bo concealed no longer, nnd the day uf
exposure nnd disgrace camo ever nearer.
It was In tho old-fnshloned times whon thero
vtcro un railroads, no lolcgrnnli, no means of
travel, 6ave over lU-kcpt roads, generally on
horsoback. It was beforo the t'.ny when
drafts, bills of exchange, nnd similar banking
conveniences for facilitating monoy transfers
had roached nn thing like modern perfection
ana puv ments wcro mado nt a dlstauco by
tending the money Itself. I
It was also tho custom ot tho various coun­
ty collectors and treasurers to lunke i early
trips to tha State capital, earning such mon­
eys ns had been collected in their districts on
behalf of tho bfalo anil tho nocossary papers
and.;rncbers, and havo an annual settlement
fortho year's receipts and disbursements.
Now, at tho tlmo when Dcrcreux'a affairs
were most desperate), his own rottntj' treas­
urer started out on horseback with tho Stato
monor, a largo sum. In a pair of saddlebags,
to effect his annual nrcountliur.
On tho roud he was Joined by A follow trav­
eller, who afterword woa proved to be
Povoronx. Thev put unone night nt a road­
side tavern, occupv ing tho same room. Next
morning the trrasurcr was found dead In
bed. his throat cut frjm car to oar. Ills com­
panion had disapprnrexl, and tho saddle,
bags, with their contents, wcro also missing.
Tho country sldo was aroused, bloodhounds
wcro brought out, aud a fierce chose ut somo
hours resulud in Dovcreux being run down and
captured. Thero was no question but that he
had been tho murdered man's companion tbo
night boforo, bu: none of tho rulsjing money or
papers were found upon bun.

'llicse wcro tho facts In tliacasa. When tno
news passed from traveller to traveller alonn
the country roads, und finally reached Dever­
eux s home town, thers was a tremendous sen­
sation, further heightened when the t'amnlng
circumstances of his business affairs tutno to
light nnd made clear the motivoof tho trlmo.
Novcrthcltsf. many of his friends wcro
still Ioval, strong family Influouco was exert­
ed in his behslr, tho bestlaweyri were im­
ploved. and even erTort was mado to frcohlm
from the conseuuoiice of his iiwfiii crime. All
without avatl. Ho was tried, found guilty,
and aenletiavl to be hanged. The higher
courts decided ngainst him on appeal. 'Ihe
Oovernor refused to interfere. and Devifux oc­
cupied a cell In tho Jail at tho little town of St.
btephens. closely guarded, within a few days
of tho datK appointed for his execution, with
nil prospect of escape seerulnelv cutolt.
In spit of the enormity of his crime, thero
begun to bo a great deal of sympathy for tho
man who lay lu ail nnatllng death. His
icmth. his handsome face, his graceful, dlgnl­
lied bearing, his calm com ago, his perfict mnn.
ner. and his unfailing persistence In tho dicla-
ration of his Imiotenre. all riinililnp.1 In nrmlm..

this effect. He expressed uo animosity toward
witnesses. Judge, Jury, or prosecutor, simply
stating that he win an unfortunate victim of
remarnnble cirmmst vnces. frum adilua he
could blame no on for drawing tho mistaken
lnfi renin of his guilt
Tho MierllT who guarded him iras of tho
number uf thoso thus Impressed, nnd in his
secret hpirt deeply sorrowed at tho prospect of
his sad duty rtthough ho rrlaxed not at nil lu
vlirllance and the adoption ot every pre-eaotiun
to prevent evapo.
To this otllccr the prisoner frequently ex.
pressed tii; firm Iwllef that ho wonld not l-o
hanged. He assured him that, however, bo
liaU no Idea ut escape, other than by son e 1)1­
ylnu intervention, which would establish his
Innocence and point out the guilty man.
Not many dajs beforo the one fatal dav tho
Sheriff found the prisoner vlslhlj agitated anil
In an excited state, nntlcoabl different from his
usual calmness in answer to tho officer'
Question ns to the reason, Devercux gave tho
following explanation:
""I have hail.' ho -iid, ""a most oxtr.iordlniry
experience. It came to me last night In tho
form of a dream bo rual. distinct, nnd differ­
ent from the usual hnzj dimness of ordinary
vi'lons that 1 believe it to be the premonition
of an nctual oveiit. I cannot rid myself of
th's Impression. I expect It may seem fooil.h
to you or the nsult of tho broodtngs nnd half­
waking imaginings of a mini In my condition,
but nevcrtheltss I will tell It to you.
Lust night I dreamed I was standing on tho
icaflold fai lug thousands of people. 1 ho scene
wa as red to mo as tho actuality itu-lf. I
had npokeu a fen words of fiirovvoll, and was
nbout to resign myself to jour hands, when
suddenly by the exercise of some new faculty
or perception. 1 saw the real murderer stand­
ing in the crvwd be-foro me. I never saw him
ljoforc. and vet I kne him to 1 tho man In
whose stead was about to sudor death, lie

was slight In Im Id. with dark hair nnd eyes
and neatly dressed. His features nro Indelibly
llxed In my mind. With this recognition
my drjam faded away. There vvna no furthei
Intimation as to my fate. Jot I feel indeed as
though (,od himself has spoken to me and re.
taloi the absolute assurance ot His divine
protection.""
Tho nnrrator's mannor tins, o earnest nnd
Impressive that a hope sprang up resiKinslve
In he bherilfs mind that something might
happen. He vyas mentally prepared nnd on
tho nateh for the happening of the miraculous.
The dnv of the execution was a beautiful,
clear, cool, Octotxjr day. Thousands ot people
vvero 1 1 attendance and had gathered about
the gallows It was to be a publlo hanging
and tho multltudo availed Itwlf i,f tho privi­
lege of seeing n human being choked to death.
As his been Intimated, thero was much feel­
lug und Bvrapathy for the doomed mnn, much
argument ns to the fallibility of circumstan­
tial ovldonce, and a hundred vague rumors In
circulation suggesting his Innocence
At last Devercux tood upon tho gallows
platform and faced tho peopln. Thero was no
man in all that crowd apparently so cool, so
collected, and sn much the master of himself.
Ilo stepped forward to say a fow words of
farowel . His voice rang out In the stillness
clear, distinct, ami perfoi tlv nuillhfo to all.

t Honda."" ho said, ""this Is not a jlttlng

hasty exclamation and atlimpt-d to gctnwaj,

and held by the crowd. The Hhcrllf. almost

BRYAN'S ELECTION.
Its Effect on Business, According to Ex""
Congressman Hiclisiril 1. island,
oDIissoitri.
Lebanon, Mo., October 1. Tho imme­
diate effect of the election of Mr. Bryan
and a free coinage Congress would be tho
revival cf business activity and prosper­
ity, for the reason that wo admit that
there would be a rise in prices consequent
on tho free coinage of silver. People hav­
ing money and capital would not wait for
a bill to pass until more money was put
in circulation, but would immediately be­
gin to put their money to use in the pur
chase of property, and invest in all kinds
of productive enterprises, this to discount
aud anticipate tho rise in prices. They
would not wait until the rise actually
commenced or took place, but would im­
mediately invest so as to take advantago
of tho rising market.
This feeling of confidence would cause
money to come out of hoarding places to
bo invested in property and business pur­

witlj the free coinage of silver prices

take advantage of the rise.
Should McKinley be elected he will
have a Senate opposed to him and his
policies. He could not turn a wheel; ho
could do nothing excepting to sit help­
lessly in the Whito House, like Cleveland
has done and issue bonds from time to time
to get gold to maintain the einglo stand­
ard promised in the St. Louis platform.
This would bo all he could do for tho
next four years. Tho election of Mc­
Kinley would mean no change from pres­
ent conditions. Tho election of Bryan
all admit would effect a radical change
from tho plutocratic rule of tho last quar­
ter of a century. R. P. Bland.

SOMERSAULTS FOR FATNESS.
New Swedish Cure for Corpulency Which
Endangers Dignity.
Except thecommon cold, against which
thousands of years of scientific inquiry
have been ineffective, there is scarcely
a disease which has not its patent cure.
Many inventions came from Sweden,
where massage establishments are more
common than public houses, and where
there is hardly an ill, from headache to
heartburn, which cannot be cured for
you by the ministrations of ingeniously­
contrived punching machines. But the
strangest of Sweden’s inventions for the
bettering of the health of humanity has
only Just been brought into publicity.
It is a cure for corpulence, and its
main principles are that the sufferers
should turn somersaults. There are
some who might object that any lady or
gentleman capable of turning a somer­
sault cannot, strictly speaking, be re­
garded as corpulent, and most people,
unless very corpulent indeed, would cer­
tainly prefer their present state to this
eventful and inconvenient method of
changing it. Even the most particular
of us would surely prefer that our elder­
ly relations, especially if feminine,
should prefer their present appearance
rather than descend to such an alarming
sacrifice of dignity.—London Graphic.

it is easy to see therefore that it is

recently Bank while being dry dooked at
New York. The secretary says in Bub­

boat of her class in the navy. She has
been Bnbjeot, he says, to malioious and
surreptitious attaoks from naval offloers,
and he issues a general order against offi­

Cf the sea I must be protected
against the chafing of sands and rocks

This protection lies in a sheath of steeL

The jute is spun about the core exactly

As one goes about among the spin­

spise the White Man's
Languatre.
For years froverivment instructors
iiinouff tlie Iniiians have been troubled
by the fact t hat the red men., after learn­
ing English at l.he schools as children,
invariably return o their own tongues
and seem positively txj ihate the white
man's lan$riuifv'.
The superintfiuieut of Indian schools,
V. X. llailinan. in a report just made to
the cotmuissiuner of 1 ndiau affairs, says
that the Indians were :wrtually taught
to hate the English tongue, because of
l.he rig-id rules aig-aitist the use of any
Ind!a.ii conversation by puiils. Until
h;tely the great majority of Indian
ttsichers have lalKired under the delu­
sion that they can hasten the acquisi­
tion of tlie English language on the part
of the pupils by compulsory measures,
visiting more or less severe penalties
upon the unfortunate, children -v ho were
ciuight in the use of the Indian speech.
The tuire.a-soiiabIene-s of such pro­
ceedings, which a.re always punished
with more or less serious failure, ap­
pears when it is considered that an
idiom that is forced upon a. child by
means of e.n.It ies and other appeals
to fear is ""necessarily hateful to him.
Then, in his own heart, he turns away
from it ajid u.ses it only under more or
less pronounced protests. This be­
comes quite manifest as soon as the
children tire removed from the restraint
of the school, when, for instance, tihey
return to their parents for a visit or
more or less permanently after gradua­
tion, and when, on meeting their
former teachers, they will either re­
fuse to speak English altogether or an
swer with sname-taceu reiucta,nce.
I'rof. Ilailmau says: ""There is no
doubt in mv mind that the unreason
ableness of the offensive warfare made
in the Indian sohools against Indiaiu
vermicular is largely to blame for the
pparent stubbornness with, wlnc.i
older Indians refuse to learn English
or to use the little knowledge thereof
whie.h they may jossess. If it is argued
that with lilwrtf to use the Indian ver
micular the Indian children wiil engage
in conversation, posstoiy improjer,
which tlie teacher can neither under
stand nor control, the fault lies not
with the child's knowledge and .u.se of
his own idiom, but with the teacher's
ignorance of thesaaiie, and tlie remedy
will be found not in the repressive
measures, hich must, because of their
unreasonableness, failof their purpose,
but in the dcterminod effort on the
teachers part to acquire a. knowledge
of t he child's idiom.
""Probably the traditional hostile at
titude of certain schools to the Indian
vernacular is responsible for the fact
that in a number of instances teachers
nnd oilier school employes continue a!
the same school, working with tlie same
tribe of Indians, without, aeqniring any
appreciable knowledge of the language
spoken a.t the homes of their children.
This icnorance frequent lv extends to
the ctis-oms. habits of life, and the his­
torical development, of the tribe in
question. J hey seem to treat the In
dians as outcasts, and the outcome of
their work corresponds with this atti
tude."" Chicago Tribune.

Any Citizen who is tired of mundane
concerns, and wants to fix his mind on
something higher, is invited to con­
sider the allegation of Sir Francis Gal­
ton, made in the London Fortnight Re­
view, that someone on Mars is signal""
ling the Earth. Tho information seems
not as yet to be generally confirmed by
astronomical observers, but Sir Fran­
cis is quoted as authority for the re­
port that in one of tho European ob­
servatories an apparatus has been de

vised for recording the Martain Hashes

and that tho record shows that three
signals and no more are made, and that
they differ, as all ilash-Hght signals do,
in the length of the Hashes and of the

intervals between, so that if wo had
tho key they might bo read like tele­
graphic messages.
Of course this U not a yarn to be
swallowed whole, but tho association
of the namo of Sir Francis Oalton with
it is enough to entitle it to considera­
tion. Thero seems to bo no intrinsic
impossibility of our having relations
with people in Mars. It sounds pre­
posterous, of course, but, like other
marvels, it seems preposterous chioily

because it is unusual. We have to
nudge oursslves from time to time in
this age of swift surprises and remind

ourselves that nothing that is new to
us can possibly bo more raaryelous
than many things that have grown fa

Each Relieved of Periodic Pain and Back­
ache. A Trio of Fervent Letters.
Before using Lydia E. Pinkham’s Vegetable
Compound, my health was gradually being under­
mined. I suffered untold agony from painful
menstruation, backache, pain on top of my
head and ovarian trouble. I concluded to
try Mrs. Pinkham’s Compound, and found
that it was all any woman needs who suffers
with painful monthly periods. It entirely
cured me. Mrs. Georoie Wass,
923 Bank St., Cincinnati, O.
For years I had suffered with painful men­
struation every month. At the beginning of
menstruation it was impossible fdr me to
stand up for more than five minutes, I felt so mis­
erable. One day a little book of Mrs. Pinkham’S was
thrown into my house, and I sat right down and read it.
I then got some of Lydia E. Pinkham’s Vegetable Com­
pound and Liver Pills. I can heartily say that to-day I
feel like a new woman; my monthly suffering is a thing
of the past. I shall always praise the Vegetable Compound
for what it has done for me.

STAMPS AND COLLECTORS.
' Newfoundland is to have a new issue
of stamps to consist of seven denomina
tions.
England will not permit stamp cat­
alogues to contain illustrations of Eng­
lish stamps, but it does permit illus­
trated albums made in Germany to be
sold in England. The stamp dealers
think this inconsistent, and so it is.
An enterprising firm of Geneva litho­
graphers have been doing an excellent
business in counterfeiting stamps. Re­
cently they had the audacity to attempt
to copyright these imitations, but the
Swiss government would not let them
go that far.
Some of the utterances in relation to
philately are very amusing. A writer
comments upon auction sales of stamps,
and objects vigorously to them, on the
score that the prices realized are not up
to catalogue values. ""To-day,"" he says,
solemnly, ""one can buy almost any
stamp he wants at from one-half to
two-thirds of the catalogue price."" It
would seem to be apparent that this is
proof that catalogue prices are too
high, but the writer does not see it in
that light.
THE WHEEL.
Germany has 55 bicycle tracks.
Linton says that he expects to ride
60 miles inside of two hours during this
season.
The rumor that Gladstone, at the age
of 87, had learned to ride a bicycle,
was as silly as it is untrue.
When the bicycle first appeared in
India it was not at all an uncommon
thing for natives to fall down and wor­
ship it. Calcutta can probably claim
more woman cyclists than any other
city in India. They ride very well, too.
There are indications that the fes
tive scorcher will tire of his fun be
fore long. The . police are arresting
these fast youth in all directions, and it
costs every one of them from five to
ten dollars to attain his freedom. That
is too costly sport.
The real secret of riding a bicycle
safely on a crowded street is to ride
slowly, never to relax watchfulness,
and to keep from three to six yards be­
hind the vehicle you are following. A
slow rider can stop and dismount, or
jump at a moment's notice. The fast
rider cannot do it with safety, or quick­
ly enough.

W. McCready, a prominent sbeep man of
Klickitat County, and a party of sheep
men, consisting of Will Coleman, Milt
Moorehead, George Van Ostran, the elder
Coleman and a herder, while in the vi­
cinity of the ""Swamp Corrals"" on the
upper Klickitat River, a few days ago,
came across a yearling brown bear, which
was quickly treed by a pack of coyote
bounds, tbree in number, belonging to
Will Coleman.
The bear being only a yearling and
being treed bo easily, Van Ostran offered
to climb the tree and shake him oat. The
animal held on the limb and refused to
be shaken off. Then a rope was passed to
Van Outran, who threw a noose over the
bear's head and, giving tbe rone to one
of the boys who was on horseback, the
latter took a turn around tbe born of the
saddle and succeeded in pulling the bear
down.
Then the fun commenced. The bear
rushed at the horse and struck him a
powerful blow with bis paw, cutting a
de-p gash in the horse's shoulder and side
nnd freeinc himself from the lariat. The
sheep men were all up bull pines by this
time and had a fine view of the battle, the
hounds being assisted by a shepherd do.*.
The shepherd getting too near, the bear
made a lunge at him, and getting his
claws under the dog's collar, held him off
while he delivered a terrific cuff.
The hounds closed in to help the shep­
herd dog. They were put out of the game in
one, two and three order, with the excep­
tion of A. Smyth's staghound Rattler,
which seized the bear by the throat and
was immediately locked in an embrace
such as only a bear can give. The two
rolled over and over on the ground, the
dog never breaking bis hold and lying so
close to the bear's breast, that bruin was
unable, apparently, to squeeze him very
hard. Thus they fought for over twenty
minutes, until at last the bear succumbed,
with his windpipe cut in twain.

The conferees on the tariff bill found
themselves today apparently further apart
than they were at the beginning of the
conference. There was no Immediate
prospect of agreement, and more thard one
member stated that the entanglement was
such that the settlement might be indefi­
nitely prolonged. 'They state in a very re­
served manner that there are numerous
questions of difference, but refuse to go
into details, even to other senators and.
members. From all that can be learned,
however, there has been a general reces­
sion from the partial agreements made
on the more important articles until
sugar, wool, hides, &c., can be definitely
fixed. Sugar Is still the principal conten­
tUon. The best reports represent the House
conferees, with Speaker Reed behind them.
as holding out for the House sugar sched­
uile, without any change whatever, and
the senators are quite as determined not
to yild to this extent. The House con­
ferecs insist that this schedule must be
definitely fixed befere other questions shall
be again taken up.
OJne of the other questions of secondary
imp~ortance upon which sharp differences
have arisen Is the Senate amendment for
a stamp tax on stocks and bonds. The
House opposes the amendment, but the
senators, while not wedded to it, insist
upon it as necessary for revenue. The
House is also resisting strenuously the :M5
per cent duty placed upon hides nnd is
at the same time persistently holding cut
for a restoration of gunny bags, cotton
ties. etc., to the dutiable list.
A senator who talked with some of the
conferees said: ""They are in a temporary
tieadlock, and are tied up all along the
line. It looks as If the situation might
remnain unchanged for a week.""
While this appears to be a correct out­
line of the situation today, the prevailing
Impression is that a settlement of one or
two lmporta~nt schedules would oe speed­
iiy followed by a complete adjustment
of all other differences.
The Senate conferees are disposed to re­
sent the efforts","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1897-07-14/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,dlc_havanese_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Evening star.,W.D.

of goods. All honor to Lydia, the Chris­
tian saleswoman.
Submission to Rules.
The second counsel I have to give to
clerks is that you seek cut what are the
lawful regulations of your establish­
ment, and then submit to them. Every
well ordered house has its usages. In
military life, on ship's deck, in com­
mercial life, there must be order and
discipline. Those people who do not
learn how to obey will never know how
to command. I will tell you what young
man will make ruin, financial and mor­
al. It is the young man who thrusts his
thumb into his vest and says: ""Nobody
shall dictate to me. I am my own mas­
ter. I will not submit to the regula­
tions ofJhis house. "" Between an estab­
lishment m which all the employees
are under thorough discipline and the
establishment in which the employees
do about as they choose is the difference
between success and failure between
rapid accumulation and utter bankrupt­
cy. Do not come to the store ten min­
utes after the time. Be there within
two seconds and let it be two seconds
before instead of two seconds after. Do
not think anything too insignificant to
do well. Do not say, ""It's only just
once."" From the most important trans­
action in commerce down to the partic­
ular style in which you tie a string
around a bundle obey orders. Do not
get easily disgusted. While others in
the store may lounge or fret or com­
plain you go with reacty hands and
cheerful face and contented spirit to
your work. When the bugle sounds, the
good soldier asks no questions, but
shoulders his knapsack, fills his cauteen
and listens for the command of
""Jtfarch!""
Do not get the idea that your inter­
ests and those of your employer are an­
tagonistic. His success will be your
honor. His embarrassment will ba your
dismay. Expose none of the frailties of
the firm. Tell no store secrets. Do not
blab. Rebuff those persons who come
to find out from clerks what ought nev­
er to be known outside the store. Do
not be among those young men who take
on a mysterious air when something is
said against the firm that employs them,
as much as to say, ""I could tell you
something if I would, but I won't.""
Do not be among those who imagine
they can build themselves up by pull­
ing somebody else down. Be not
ashamed to be a subaltern.
Again, I counsel clerks to search out
what are the unlawful and dishonest
demands of an establishment and resist
them. In the 6,000 years that have
passed there has never been an occasion
when it was one's duty to sin against
God. It is never right to do wrong. If
the head men of the firm expect of you
dishonesty, disappoint them. ""Oh,""
yon say, ""I should lose my place then.""
Better lose your place than lose your
soul. But you will not lose your place.
Christian heroism is always honored.
You go to the head man of your store
and say: ""Sir, I want to serve you. I
want to oblige you. It is frcm no lack
of- industry on my part, but this thing
seems to me to be wrong, and it is a
sin against my conscience, it is a sin
against God, and I beg you, sir, to ex­
cuse me."" He may flush up and swear,
but he will cool down, and he will have
more admiration for you than for those
whb submit to his evil dictation, and
while they sink you will rise. Do not,
because ox seeming temporary advan­
tage, give up your character, young
man. Under God that is the only thing
you have to build on. Give up that,
you give up everything. That employer
asks a young man to hurt himself for
time and for eternity who expects him
to make a wrong entry, or change an
invoice, or say goods cost so much when
they cost less, or impose upon the ver­
dancy of a customer, or misrepresent a
style of fabric. How dare he demand of
you anything so insolent?
A Few Trials.
Again, I counsel all clerks to conquer
the trials of their particular position.-One
great trial for clerks is the incon­
sideratiou of customers. There are peo­
ple who are entirely polite everywhere
else, but gruff and dictatorial and con­
temptible when they come into a store
to buy anything. There are thousands
cf men and women who go from store
to store to price things, without any
Idea of purchase. They are not satisfied
until every roll of goods is brought
down and they have pointed out all the
real or imaginary defects. They try
on all kinds of kid gloves and stretch
them out of shape, and they put on all
tyles of cloak and walk to the mirror to
ee how they look, and then they sail

out of the store, saying, ""T will not
take it today,"" which means, ""I don't
want it at all,"" leaving the clerk amid
a wreck of ribbons and laces and cloths
to smooth out a thousand dollars'
worth of goods not a cent of which
did that man or woman buy or expect
to buy. Now, I call that a dishonesty
on the part of the customer. If a boy
runs into a store and takes a roll of
cloth off the counter and sneaks out into
the street, you all join in the cry pell­
mell, ""Stop thief!"" When I see you go
into a store, not expecting to buy any­
thing, but to price things, stealing the
time of the clerk and stealing the time
of his employer, I say, too, ""Stop thief!""
- If I were asked which class of per

sons most need the grace of God amid
their annoyances, I would say, ""Dry
goods clerks. "" All the indignation of
customers about the high prices comes
i I T71 1 A 1.
on the cierir. hot instance: a great,
war comes. The manufactories are
closed. The people go off to battle. The
price of goods runs up. A customer
comes into a store. Goods have gone up.
""How much is that worth?"" ""A dol­
lar."" ""A dollar! Outrageous! A dol­
lar!"" Why, who is to blame for the fact
that it has got to be a dollar? Does the
indignation go out to the manufacturers
on the banks of the Merrimac because
they have closed up? No. Does the in­
dignation go out toward the employer,
who is out at his country seat? No. It
comes on the clerk. He got up the war.
He levied the taxes. He puts up the
rents. Of course, the clerk.
Then a great trial comes to clerks in
the fact that they see the parsimonious
side of human nature. You. talk about
lies behind the counter there are just
as many lies before the counter. Au­
gustine speaks of a man who adver­
tised that he would, on a' certain occa­
sion, tell the people what was in their
hearts. A crowd assembled, and he
stepped to the front and said: ""I will
tell you what is in your hearts. To buy
cheap and sell dear. "" Oh, lay not aside
your urbanity when you go into a store!
Treat the clerks like gentlemen and la­
dies, proving yourself to be a gentle­
man or a lady. Remember that if the
prices arahigh and your purse is lean
that i3 no fault of the clerks. And if
you have a son or a daughter amid those
perplexities of commercial life, and
such a one comes home all worn out,
be lenient, and know that the martyr
at the stake no more certainly needs
the grace of God than our young peo­
ple amid the seven times heated exas­
perations of a clerk's life.
Inconsiderate Employers.
Then there are all the trials which
come to clerks from the treatment of
inconsiderate employers. There are pro­
fessed Christian men who have no more
regard for their clerks than they have
for the scales on which the sugars are
weighed. A clerk is no more than so
much store furniture. No consideration
for their rights or interests. Not one
word of encouragement from sunrise to
sunset, nor from January to December.
But when anything goes wrong a
streak of dust on the counter or a box
with the cover off thunder showers of
scolding. Men imperious, capricious,
cranky toward their clerks their whole
manner as much as to say, ""All the in­
terest I have in you is to see what I can
get out of you."" Then there are all the
trials of incompetent wages, not in
such times as these, when if a man gets
half a salary for his services he ought
to be thankful, but I mean in prosper­
ous times. Some of you remember when
the war broke out and all merchandise
went up, and merchants were made
millionaires in six months by the sim­
ple rise in the value of goods. Did the
clerks get advantage of that rise? Some­
times, not always. I saw estates gath­
ered in those times over which the
curse of God has hung ever since. The
cry cf unpaid men and women in those
stores reached the Lord of Sabaoth, and
the indignation of God has been around
those establishments ever since, flash­
ing in the chandeliers, glowing from
the crimson upholstery, rumbling in
the long roll of the tenpin alley. Such
men may build up palaces of merchan­
dise heaven high, but after awhile a
disaster will come along and will put
one hand on this pillar and another
hand on that pillar and throw itself for­
ward until down will come the whole
structure, crushing the worshipers as
grapes are mashed in the winepress.
Then there are boys ruined by lack
of compensation. In how many prosper­
ous stores it has been for the last 20
years that boys were given just enough
money to teach them how to- steal!
Some were seized upon by the police.
The vast majority of instances were not
known. The head of the firm asked,
""Where is George now?"" ""Oh, he isn't
here any more. ' ' A lad might better
starve to death on a blasted heath than
take one farthing from his employer.
Woe be to that employer who unneces­
sarily puts a temptation in a boy's way.
There have been great establishments in
these cities, building marble palaces,
their owners dying worth millions and
millions and millions, who made a vast­
amount of their estate out of the blood
and muscle and nerve of half paid
clerks. Such men as well, I will not
tnention any name. But I mean men
who have gathered up vast estates at
the expense of the people who were
ground under their heel. ""Oh,"" say
such merchants, ""if you don't like it
here, then go and get a better place!""
As much as to say: ""I've got you in
my grip, and I mean to hold you. You
cau't get any other place.""
' True Sympathy.
Oh, what a contrast between those
men and Christian merchants who to­
day are sympathetic with their clerks
when they pay the salary, acting in this
way: ""This salary that I give you is
not all my interest in you. You are an
immortal man; youware an immortal
woman. I am interested in your pre­
sent and your everlasting welfare. I
want you to understand that if I am a
little higher up in this store I ain be­
side you in Christian sympathy."" Go
back 40 or 50 years to Arthur Tappen's
store in New York, a man whose worst
enemies never questioned his honesty.

I Every morning be brought all the

clerks and the accountants and the
weighers into a room for devotion.
They sang, they prayed, they exhorted.
On Monday morning the clerks wero
asked where they bad attended church
on the previous day and what the ser­
mons were anout. It must have sound­
ed strangely, that voice of praise along
the streets where the devotees of Mr.ni­
mon were counting their golden beads.
You say, Arthur Tappen failed. Yes,
he was unfortunate, like a great many
good men, but I understand he met all
his obligations before he left this world;
and I know that he died in the peace of
the gospel and that he is before the
throne of G?d today forever blessed.
If that be failing, I wish you might all
fail.
There are a great many young men
and young women who want a word of
encouragement Christian encourage­
ment. One smile of good cheer would
be worth more to them tomorrow morn­
ing in their places of business than a
present of 15,000 ten years hence. Oh,
I remember the apprehension and the
tremor of entering a profession. I re­
member very well the man who greeted
me in the ecclesiastical court with the
tip ends of the long fingers of the left
hand, and I remember the other man
who took my hand in both of his and
said: ""God bless you, my brother. You
have entered a glorious profession. Bo
faithful to God, and he will see you
through."" Why, I feel this minute the
thrill of that handshaking, though the
man who gavo me the Christian grip
has been in heaven 20 years. There aro
old men here today who can look back
to 40 years ago, when some one said a
kind word to them. Now, old men, pay
back what you got then. It is a great
art for old men to bo able to encourage
the young. There are many young peo­
ple in our cities who have come from
inland counties, from the granite hills
of the north, from the savannas of the
southfrorn the prairies of the west.
They are here to get their fortune. They
are in boarding houses where everybody
seems to be thinking of himself. They
want companionship, and they want
Christian encouragement. Give it to
them.
Balancing: the Books.
My word is to all clerks, Be mightier
than your temptations. A Sandwich Is­
lander used to think when he slew an
enemy all the strength of that enemy
came into his own right arm. And I
have to tell you that every misfortune
you conquer is so much added to your
own moral power. With omnipotence
for a lever and tho throne of God for a
fulcrum you can move earth and heav­
en. While there are other young men
putting the cup of sin to their lips you
stoop down and drink out of the foun­
tains of God, and you will rise up
strong to thrash the mountains. Tho
ancients used to think that pearls wero
fallen raindrops, which, touching the
surface of the sea.hardened into gems,
then dropped to the bottom. I have to
tell you today that storms of trial have
showered imperishable pearls into many
a young man's lap. Oh, young man,
while you havo goods to sell, remember
you havo a soul to save. In a hospital a
Christian oaptain, wounded a few days
before, got delirious, and in the mid- j
night hour he sprang out on the floor of j
the hospital, thinking he was in the I
battle, crying: ""Come on, boys! For- j
ward! Charge!"" Ah, he was only bat- j
tling the specters of his own brain! But
it is no imaginary conflict into which I
call you, young man, today. There are
10,000 spiritual foes that would cap­
ture you. In the name of God, up and
at them!
After the last store has been closed,
after the last bank has gone down, after,
the shufflo of the quick feet on the cus­
tom houso steps has stopped, after tho
long line of merchantmen on tho sea
has taken sail of flame, after Washing­
ton and New York and London and
Vienna have gone down into the grave
where Thebes and Babylon and Tyre
lie buried, after tho great fire bells of
the judgment day have tolled at the
burning of a world on that day all
the affairs of banking houses and stores
will come up for inspection. Oh, what
an opening of account books! Side by
side the clerks and the men who em­
ployed them. Every invoice made out
all the labels of goods all certificates
of stock all lists of prices all private
marks of the firm, now explained so
everybody can understand them. All
the maps of cities that were never built,
but in which lots were sold all bar­
gains, all gougings, all snap judgments,
all false entries, all adulteration of
liquors with coppers and strychnine.
All mixing of teas and sugars and
coffees and sirups, with cheaper mate­
rial, all embezzlements of trust funds.
All swindles iu coal and iron and oil
and silver and stocks. On that day
when the cities of this world are smok­
ing in the last conflagration the trial
will go on, and down in an avalanche
of destruction will go those who wrong­
ed man or woman, insulted God and
defied the judgment. Oh, that will be
a great day for you, honest Christian
clerk. No getting up early, no retiring
late, no walking around with weary
limbs, but a mansion in which to live
and a realm of light and love and joy
over which to hold everlasting domin­
ion. Hoist him up from glory to glory
and from song to song and from throne
to throne, for while others go down
into the sea with their gold like a mill­
stone hanging to their neck, this one
shall come up the heights of amethyst
and alabaster, holding in his right
hand the pearl of great price in a spar­
kling, glittering, flaming casket.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84022871/1897-07-19/ed-1/seq-6,"","",6,"","",1,vtu_middlebury_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Orleans County monitor.,E.H.

SEATTLE, Wash., July 22-Fred Price,
a Seattle man who has returned from the
Klondike with several thousand dollars in
gold dust, says that there is great fear of
suffering on the part of those who attempt
to go into that country without an abun­
dance of supplies of provisions. He does
not believe the trading companies can be­
gin to supply the demand which will be
made on them. Price thinks the men who
take up horses to cross the pass from Dyea
will do well. They can get their provisions
in easy that way and sell the horses for
dog meat afterward.

He also advises newcomers to look for
claims on other creeks besides the tribu­

pretty well staked out. Stewart river
creeks promise as well as the Klondike. He

Games of every description are running,
and some of the miners play very heavy.
They go into the mining town in sheer des­

winter and gamble in a reckless manner to
break the monotony. Price says it 4s hard
to get along in Dawson City on less than

times that much. He claims that one
saloon cleaned up $30,000 in three weeks
this summer.

Every day one sees things which
force him to believe that Burnum said
it all when he declared that ‘ ‘the Ameri­
can people like to be humbugged.”
They will applaud the bogus, the mako
believe, and allow the genuine—or, to
use a worse bit of slang, ‘‘the real thing”
—to go off the scene without so much
as “a hand.”
Fine frenzies in thedramatio business
are a waste of energy,, so I am told by
a ooupleof actors, and here is the story,
a tale of how two ambitious ones gave
to the exasperating public perhaps the
greatest bit of stage realism every pre­
sented aud received for their pains—and
bruises—an awful silence aud a few
pointed remarks from the gallery critics.
I forget what the play was, and who
the actors were has nothing whatever to
do with the matter at this time. They
are both stars today, however. One did
heroic parts and the other the ‘‘Ha, ha:
I’ll steal the girl.” They had played in
several pieces together aud were friends.
One was a believer in real tears aud all
that goes to constitute living the part,
while the other believed that at no time
should the actor allow the lines or situ­
ations of the piece to make him forget
himself.
In the piece which they were playing
the hero and the villain meet at a crit­
ical moment and fight. In case the hero
failed to settle his opponent—well, he
got his salary for doing it, so it had to
occur.
The fight was rehearsed and was
made to look real to a startling degree.
The gallery used to go wild and the
whole house resounded with the ap­
plause, hut this did not suit the villain,
who believed in realism. It was his be­
lief that a real fight would make a hit.
I believe I mentioned the fact that they
were friends. That was true. They were
up to the moment where one, in a mo­
ment of indiscretion, attempted to crit­
icise the other. Of course everybody
knows that when that occurs all friend­
ship ceases—between actors. Of course
there were coarse remarks passed, and
the one who believed in realism and be­
ing an actor off aud on finally folded his
arms and said, “When aud where?”
‘‘Right here, if you like. It’s a short
job anywhere.”
“You think so, eh? Well, it shall oc­
cur in our fight scene tonight. For once
the public shall see what they pay for.
The plot of the play necessitates that
you vanquish me. We shall see whether
it is so short a job. ”
The worst of the quarrel was that
they were both athletes, good wrestlers
and boxers and willing.
The play dragged slowly that night
until the fight scene.
The hero’s line, “It is either you or
I, Reginald Marshallson, ” was answered
by—in an undertone—“ You bet it is,
and I’ll mark you so you won’t play for
a month. ”
Instead of going to a clinch, as usual,
they both sparred about for an opening.
They wero too long in finding it, aud
from the gallery a critic shouted:
“W’at’s de matter wid youse? Why
don’t ye git togedder?”
Then they both led and landed with
a wallop. Then they clinched. The vil­
lain back heeled the hero, and down
they went.
“Fight like a man, not like a dog,”
whispered the hero in hoarse tones.
The villain allowed him to get on liis
feet, and they began to spar again.
About the time the.gallery got restless
the hero landed a right on the villain’s
eye tnat sent him reeling. Had he reel­
ed the otiier way all would have been
well, as the hero would have gone on
with the piece, but as the hero crossed
the stage toward him the realist rushed
and knocked him down with a swing­
ing left.
Now, by all the laws of melodrama
the villain at no time should get the
better of the hero in a personal encoun­
ter. The gallery knew that and roundly
hissed the hero for so far forgetting
himself. The stage manager knew it
aud ran to one of the wings to prompt
him. The hero knew it, aud he went
back at the villain for keeps.
They fought for five minutes all over
the stage. They knocked down papier
mache trees, a stoop to a house and a
fence, besides each other. The whole
company stood in the wings watching
the mill, and the manager cursed and
made awful threats in a stage whisper,
but somehow the audience was not im­
pressed. The gallery yelled: “Yer
fakin. Why don’t ye fight?” The bal­
cony, from which on previous nights
waves of approval had broken, sat quiet,
bored and sullen. The parquet, always
willing to follow the lead from above
on previous occasions, now sat glum,
waiting until the very bad imitation of
a fight should end.
The hero fought desperately. He must
win. The plot of the piece worked out
from his victory, but the villain clinched
and fought as he had never dreamed of
fighting. In spite of warnings from the
wings he refused to be knocked senseless
and allow the hero to go on and rescue
the girl.
At last the stage manager threatened
them with the curtain, aud the hero
with one mighty effort freed himself
from the grasp of the realist and, rush­
ing toward the house in which the
heroine was supposed to be, cried with
a harelip accent: “Beware of me,
Reginald Marshallson! My just purpose
shall not be thwarted.”
As he had one eye closed and his
mouth swollen out of heroic proportions
the sentence did not cause the gallery
to make any particular fuss. The hero­
ine refused to allow him to kiss her in
the rescue scene, aud the manager dis­
charged them both.—Chicago Times-
Herald.

DIDN’T CARE ABOUT STYLE.
But Nevertheless He Wouldn't Go Down
Town Without a Necktie.
“Georgiana,” said Mr. Dalrymple,
""it seems to me that you spend alto­
gether too much time worrying about
what other folks are likely to think
about you. Why don’t you follow my
example and have a little independ­
ence? As long as I know that I am do­
ing my duty as a man what do I care
how others like my style?”
“I don’t know,” Mrs. Dalrymple re­
plied, “what you mean. In what way
iiav9 I been worrying about wliat other
folks think of me?”
“Oh, in a hundred ways,” her hus­
band answered. “You wouldn’t wear
the waist yon have on if it were not for
the fact that all the other women wear
them aud would think you couldn’t
afford it if you didn’t have one. You
wouldn’t care whether you had lace
curtains at the windows if other folks
didn’t have them. You wouldn’t spend
money for a hundred and one other
things that you could get along with­
out just as well as not if you were not
always trying to pose before other peo­
ple.”
“Well,” Mrs. Dalrymple assented,
for she was not disposed to quarrel over
the matter, “it is perhaps as you say.
I am sorry that it is so, but I can’t help
it. Aren’t you afraid you’ll be late at
the office this morning? And you
haven’t put on your necktie this morn­
ing. How did you come to forget it?”
“By George!” he exclaimed, looking
at his watch, “it’s nearly 8 o’clock
now. I don’t know how I happened to
[ forget my necktie. Where is it?- I must
hurry. ”
“Oh, never mind the tie this morn­
ing,” his wife said. “You’ve got a
clean shirt aud collar on. Go without
the tie.”
“What!” shouted William Dalrym­
ple. “Go down town without a necktie I
You must think I’m crazy. Why, the
boys in the office would guy the life out
of me, and people would think I didn’t
have money enough to buy one. Here
it is. Good by. ”
Then Mrs. Dalrymple sat down and
thought, and two little wrinkles with
merry curves appeared at the corners of
her mouth.—Cleveland Leader.
UNUSUAL LEGAL DECISION.
But It Was Emphatically Indorsed by the
Spectators.
“I heard the late Judge John R.
Grace of the court of appeals of Ken­
tucky set aside the verdict of a jury
once under circumstances that to my
mind did him infinite credit,” said Rep­
resentative John S. Rhea of that state
to a Washington Post representative.
“It seems that a poor woman, who
was on the verge of starvation aud who
was the sole support of four little chil­
dren, went into a neighbor’s smoke­
house and purloined a piece of bacon.
The proof was positive, and the jury
reluctantly returned a verdict of guilty.
When the finding of the jury was read,
Judge Grace, who at that time presided
over the Fourteenth judicial district,
rising to his feet, said in the most em­
phatic tones:
“ ‘The court orders that the verdict
in this case be set aside, and I want to
declare here that in all cases where an
unfortunate woman is on trial for steal­
ing food, taken to keep her offspring
from starving, it will require 18 men
to convict her of the crime in this court.
The defendant is discharged from cus­
tody. '
“The announcement was greeted
with applause from the spectators, aud
the general sentiment was that Judge
Grace had acted not only as befitted a
chivalrous man, but that his ruling
was right. Theft to keep innocent
babes from perishing of hunger can
scarcely be called a crime.”
She Wears Her Cross.
The tip to date woman wears her
cross if she is so fortunate as to possess
one. As an article of jewelry this sym­
bol of suffering is as popular as it was
in the days of the grandmothers. When
the grandmothers were girls, the pos­
session of a handsome bejeweled cross
that could be worn as a pin, a hair or­
nament or a locket amounted almost to
a badge of aristocracy. The black ones,
studded with diamonds or pearls, or
both, were highest in favor, as they are
today. The fashionable cross must be
antique looking. Not everybody’s
grandmother possessed one, however,
so the jewelers have come to the resoue
of the woman who did not fall heir to
one and are bringing out exquisite de­
signs in Roman gold. Most of them are
studded with precious stones, and many
have backgrounds of black enamel. It
is by no means a taking form of per­
sonal adornment, but the women like
it.—New York Sun.
His Bast Uw Case.
The late William S. Groesbeck of
Cincinnati never took another law case
after his defense of President Andrew
Johnson. “The brilliant speech which
won that case,” says the Cincinnati
Commercial Tribune, “proved the man’s
remarkable will and intellectual pow­
ers. He had been so ill as to bo confined
to his bed, and on the day of the trial,
and while lying in bed, he jotted down
on a sheet of foolscap paper the main
points of his defense. He was driven to
the tribunal in a carriage, unable to
walk, aud spoke extempore for four
hours and a half. At the close article
II was voted upon and the president
acquitted without the taking up of any
of the other articles. Since that time
Mr. Groesbeck had lived a life of quiet
and retirement. In 1872 he built Elm­
hurst, a noble house of superb propor­
tions, commanding a river view of un­
surpassed beauty. ’ ’

The diet of the people In this land of
abode and sunshine is simple. Melons,
green corn and such fruit as apricots and
peaches are abundant and cheap. They are
eaten by every one. Dried beef, venison
and mutton brought down from the moun­
tains are in every home, and there are all
manner of Mexican dishes and soups that
every one, even the most recent arrival
from New England, eats with pleasure in
these heated days. Alcoholic stimulants
are no doubt drunk more generally In
Arizona and all the mining localities in
the southwest than anywhere In the east,
but when Ihe mercury Is rising high the
drinker must exercise prudence In his
drums, for the Intense heat has greater
effect on n person In a state of alcoholic
intoxication than on any one else. The
sudden death of a hard drinker In a period
of unusual heat is a common occurrence
in this region, and sa,eon-keepers are
careful to see that the toper who Is Imbib­
ing freely on a hot day cither keeps In­
doors and out of the sunshine or lets up
on hi* stimulant. Many of the more care­
ful bar-keepers In Yuma and Phoenix re­
fuse to sell nny tvhlsky or brandy to hard
drinkers when the mercury Is rnngiu*
from 11(1 degrees to 115 degrees in th*
shade. Fhyslclans here say that the alco­
hol when healed produces a pressure on
the blood vessels of the brain, and one
who has weakenej these Mood vessels hy
years of alcoholism Is a first-class subject
to death front apoplexy. At the little town
of Glia Bond, 70 miles east of Yumn, hist
summer, half a dozen miners went on a
spre* whenfthe temperature was nt sliout
118 degree* Three of them died as they
lay asleep in the broiling sun, and one of
the others hits Lett demented ever since.

It is stated on German authority that the
astounding number of 2,000,000 glass eyes
are made every year in Germany and
Switzerland, while one French home man­
ufactures 300,000 of them annually. The
pvpll is made of colored glass, and some­
times red lines are painted on the inner
surface to simulate the veins. The largest
number of these eyes are bought by labor­
ers who are exposed to Are. and are con­
sequently liable to lose an eye. An arti­

cloud the surface of the glass.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1897-08-16/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,dlc_ibizanhound_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Evening star.,W.D.

trous floods that have visited China for
many years. Sixty villages near Tung-Chou,
containing over eighty thousand inhabi­
tants, have been destroyed by floods and
the people drowned or forced to flee. There
Is no means of finding out how many thou­
sands have been drowned, but the number
Is estimated by Chinese authorities at fif­
teen thousand to twenty thousand. The
flooded district is within twelve miles of
Peking, the capital of China. Asa rule Chi­
nese officials make very little stir when a
calamity like this happens, but the proxim­
ity of the disaster has resulted in its being
brought to the attention of the Emperor,
who has ordered that all possible relief be
given. Survivors from the villages nearest
Peking have been allowed such shelter as
they can find in the city walls, but thou­
sands are without protection against the
rain, which continues to fail.
The distress of these people is most pit­
iable. Public-spirited and wealthy men of
Peking and Tung-Chou are actively assist­
ing the authorities in providing them with
food. The floods have greatly damaged a
large number of estates belonging to Pe­
king nobles. The unusual rains began July
23 and continued until Aug. 15.
The crops in the flooded district were de­
stroyed. The prefects, local magistrates and
people of the flooded district prayed for the
cessation of the rain seven days before
they were Anally driven out of their homes.
Early in September high officials of
Pekin and Tien-Tsin suddenly forbnde the
slaughter of cattle, their object being to
appease the wrath of the gods and stop the
rain. Proclamations to this effect were

Tells Americans About the Armenian Mas­
sacres.
An Interview ""With the Ruler of Tur­
key by Ex-1 nited States Minlnter
Terrell?Turku Are Tolerant.
""An interview with the Sultan"" is con­
tributed to the November Century by ex­
Minister Terrell. He says:
The sultan said that the facts about
recent disturbances in Turkey have never
Leon faithfully reported by the press of
the United States, and that he hoped that
1 would make known to the American peo­
ple what he was then about to say. Con­
tinuing. he said:
""Early during the Ottoman conquests in
Asia Minor the Armenians, who were be­
ing crushed by repeated invasions of the
Tartars and the Persians, emigrated In
large numbers and obtained protection
from the Ottoman rulers. They were kind­
ly received, hospitably treated, and re­
ceived benefits in the protection of their
lives and property. No nation continually
engaged in -war can excel in industrial and
commercial pursuits. Thus it occurred
that while the early sultans were busy
with conquests all manufacturing and
commercial interests were monopolized by
Christian races, and chiefly by the Ar­
meniar.s. Their religion was also tolerated,
for Mussulmans tolerate the religion of
all men who worship God. Thus the Ar­
menians prospered and remained contented
under Mussulman rule for over four hun­
dred years. They became the manufac­
turers, contractors and bankers of the Ot­
toman empire. They enjoyed their reli­
gion, openly worshiped for centuries in
their ancient churches and monasteries,
and built new ones when needed. Their
patriarch could always present their com­
plaints at the sublime porte. and they were
always protected in the enjoyment of their
own methods of worshiping God.
""Pour books are regarded as sacred by
all Mussulmans, namely, the Koran, the
book of Confucius, the Talmud of the
Jews, and the Bible of the Christians.
How could a Mussulman murder Armen­
ians merely on account of their religion,
when the Koran prohibits cruelty and re­
quires that all men who believe in God
shall be protected, except during war?
""One of my ancestors, Selim I, the grand­
son of the conqueror of Constantinople,
cnc- thought that his empire would be
stronger if all his subjects professed tlie
same religion. Some disturbances raised
by Christian races caused him to ask the
Sheik-ul-islam if it would be lawful for
him to kill all Christians who refused to
l>e converted to Islam. The sheik issued a
fetva, in which he answered that it would
not be lawful, and that Christians who
were peaceful must be protected. So
Srlim respected the fetva. Fire worship­
ers and idoiatcrs alone have no right to
protection, and Mussulmans are prohibited
from eating meat cooked by such people.""
The sultan then cited many evidences of
the favor and partiality extended to, and
of the confidence reposed in, the Armen­
ians by himself and by former sultans, to
show that their religion was not the cause
of their recent misfortunes.
The sultan more than once repeated his
declaration that no Christians had ever
been persecuted by his government or peo­
ple for their religious faith, and that their
churches and monasteries, which have
stood from the early ages of Christianity,
had been respected, preserved and wor­
shiped in: that they had always selected
their own patriarchs and bishops, and were
always protected in the full enjoyment of
their religious freedom.
Referring to the massacres, he said: ""The
truth, unfortunately, is never published in
Christian newspapers about conflicts be­
tween my Moslem and Christian subjects.
Though no true Mussulman will ever pun­
ish any man on account of his religion, if
he worships God. yet when people bind
themselves together bv their religion and
then use it to destroy the Ottoman em­
pire a different question is presented.
While Christian Europe was excited
against the Ottoman empire about excesses
committed by its soldiers during the Greek
revolution of 1827, it had no sympathy to
bestow upon the butchery of 27,000 de­
fenseless Turkish men, women and children
who were massacred In one city after its
surrender.""

""When I first huiur out my shingle,"" said
a prominent New jfork physician to a
group of friends, among them a Star re­
porter, ""I theoght'lt would be easy to
drum up a good paying practice. But I
soon realised my mistake. Patients were
few. I didn't earn v ten dollars the first
month, and one dayi when I felt very dis­
couraged and was thinking of giving up the
study of the hps ling, art for a more lucra­
tive commercial pursuit. I met a friend.
The latter was the agent for a line of
transatlantic steamers, and on telling him
of my poor success ""as a physician, he of­
fered me a position as surgeon on one of
his ships. I accepted the berth, and. on the
evening of the third day at sea, I had an
experience with a madman, which I shall
never forget.
""The weather was very stormy, and as
I. in consequence, had had but little sleep
the two previous nights, I felt rather
drowsy, and sat In a chair In my state
loom dozing. Suddenly I was awakened by
a tremendous lurching of the vessel. Then
I heard a loud knock at my door, and a
tail, strange, and very excited dark-featur­
ed man hurriedly entered my cabin. The
man's actions were so peculiar that I
jumped to my feet and reached for a re­
volver which lay on my table. But I was
too slow. The stranger had seized the
weapon. I then asked the man grunl>
what he wanted. He did not reply for
some time, and then, after locking the
door and putting the key and my .pistol in
his pocket, said: .
'? 'I'm not sick, doctor. I've come here,
exposing a long knife from the sleeve of
his coat, 'by order of the captain to cut
your throat.'
??For a moment I looked the stranger in
the face, and his wild, steauy stare soon
convinced me that I had to deal with a
madman. .
""I am not a coward, yet even now the
thought of that moment makes me shua­
der. There I was in a remote par* or tne
ship alone with a madman of twice my
physical strength, without a chance to es­
cape or means to give alarm, and being
unarmed, entirely at his mercy. I
fore decided that resistance would be ot
the least service to me. and that apparent
acquiescence would be best. All this quick­
ly flashed through my mind, and according­
ly, feigning the utmost indifference I could,
X said *
'? 'The captain's ciders must, of course, be
obeyed. But can you do the deed quickl> .
??'Oh yes' ieplied the madman, calmij
surveying the knife which he held"" in his
hand. 'I'm a butcher by trade and can do
the job easily with this tool.'
""Here he paused to examine with his
thumb the edge of the knife, which looked
rather blunt, and as he did so an idea
struck me, and I remarked:
"" 'Your knife does not seem to have a
very kesn edge: the trachea is tough, you
know, and rather difficult to cut with such
a blunt Instrument.'
""The madman now looked at me witn a
curious expression, as if trying to read my
thoughts, and then, after examining the
knife more closely, seemed to think my sug­
gestion a good one; for he said:
"" 'Yes, doctor, I think you are right. A
little sharpening will do no harm, so lr
you don't mind waiting I will go to the gal­
ley and get the cook to help me put an
edge on It with his grindstone.' -
""This was exactly what I wanted, as,
feeling sure he would not lock the door
after him. I thought my escape would be
easv. But picture my dismay when on his
departure. I discovered that the door was
locked as securely as before.
""What was I to So? I flung open the
porthole and shouted-with all my might for

as possible, resolved to fight to the last.

by chemical analysis, and that is POSTUM CEREAL FOOD COFFEE, the only pure cereal coffee with
a palatable taste sold on this market. Most of the prominent physicians know the ingredients of Postum
and prescribe it in their practice.
Many of tine large grocers of the East have had Postum and some of the imitations analyzed, in
order to know what they were giving their customers. A notable example is that of Cobb, Bates &
Yerxa, of Boston, who have just purchased a carload of about 20,000 packages of Postum and dismissed
all imitation Cereal Coffees from their shelves.
If you can digest coffee, use pure coffee. If coffee acts unpleasantly, use Postum, and see that it is
boiled full 15 minutes after boiling commences, but do not lend yourself to concoctions and harmless
adulterations.

reports to Secretary of Agriculture Wilson.
The reports agree that while comparatively
little agriculture exists there it isj' possible
that enough of certain crops ar.d animals
may be grown to sustain a considerable
population, provided proper methods are
pursued. While Director True, of the di­
vision of experiment stations, does not re­
gard as feasible the establishment of agri­
cultural experiment stations there, he be­
lieves that experiments may be carried on
in a number of lines with great success.
The two commissioners spent three months
investigating the southern coast region of
Alaska.
The reports say that cultivated areas in
Alaska are confined to small kitchen gar­
dens in which are grown many of our earlier
and hardier vegetables. Stock raising is
carried on to a very limited extent. The
possible extension of the pasturage and gar­
dening area is quite considerable. Esti­
mates are made of an expense of S2OO per
acre in preparing the soil for cultivation.
What agriculture there will be in Alaska
will be subsidiary to fishing and other in­
dustries. according to Mr. Killin’s separate
report. Fishermen will locate on Alaskan
lands and make homes. At the present rate,
Mr. Killin says, the salmon will soon be de­
stroyed; they are being fished for in the
spawning waters to such an extent that
they have no opportunity to propagate.
Halibut, cod and herring will last forever.
Timber will not go into the market until
the yellow fir or Douglass pine of the Pa­
cific coast is exhausted, as it is superior
to the Alaskan spruce or hemlock. Alas­
kans will not feel the want of agriculture,
as freight from the coast agricultural dis­
tricts is by sailing vessel, and very cheap.
It now costs but 30 cents a day to provide
food for miners at Turn Again Arm, the
most remote part of Cook’s inlet. He says
that the Agricultural Department can do
nothing in the way of experimental sta­
tions in Alaska, but can furnish informa­
tion.
Mr. Killin says that from that country
will be drawn sailors for the merchant ma­
rine and navy. It can be done, he thinks,
by granting to every American citizen who
shall establish himself in a home for five
years on the public lands, and who shall
engage in some occupation on his own ac­
count for the same period, twenty-acre
tracts of land. with about six hundred feet
of water front. The latter will make it
possible for boats to be landed and nets to
be drawn. The timber of twenty acres of
land will build a boat, a house and furnish
fuel. As fast as the timber is taken off of
the land small fruits and green vegetables
can be growrn, and grass will be furnished
for the domestic animals. Grasses grow to
great perfection: little was seen of the cul­
tivation of cereals, but small fruits and ber­
ries abound, though practically no attention
is paid to their cultivation.
As to the country from the southern
boundary to Kodiak and Long islands, and
from the Pacific to the coast or Alaskan
mountains, the climate is extremely wret.
but not cold; winters are very long and the
feedin'g period will be at least seven months.
The cereals will not ripen and the vegeta­
bles will not mature.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015679/1897-11-05/ed-1/seq-5,"","",5,"","",1,in_bradlaugh_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Indianapolis journal.,Douglass & Conner,Indianapolis [Ind.],"","",4054,4866,2778,9199,5,21954,29301,0,in_bradlaugh_ver02/data/sn82015679/00415665738/1897110501/0039.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indianapolis,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/in_bradlaugh_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn82015679%2F00415665738%2F1897110501%2F0039.jp2/pct:18.465883,16.606942,12.653731,31.394833/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/in_bradlaugh_ver02%2Fdata%2Fsn82015679%2F00415665738%2F1897110501%2F0039.jp2/pct:18.465883,16.606942,12.653731,31.394833/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

""Every working day In the year Un­

liberately tears up and grinds to pulp
one million dollars' worth of pnpet
money genuine bnnknotes and green­
backs,"" writes Clifford Howard In the
Ladles' Home Journal. ""A million dol­
lars In one, two, Dvo, ten, twenty, fifty,
one-hundred and one-thousand dollai
notes are dally punched full of holes,

A Bl( Regular Army.

The mightiest host of this sort is the
army of invalids whose bowels, livers and
stomachs have been regulated by Hostet­
ter's Stomach Bitters. A regular habit of
body is brought about through using the
Bitters, not violently agitating and grip­
ing the intestines, but by reinforcing their
energy and causing a flow of bile into
its proper channels. Malaria, la grippe,
Jyepepsia, and a tendency to inactivity of
the kidneys are conquered by the Bitters.

friendly nations to pass In and out of the

sent to Maj. Gen. E. S. Otis, commanding
the department of the Colorado at Denver,
who has recently been, relieved from duty
as president of the court-martial which
tried Capt. O. M. Carter of the Engineer
Corps. The orders to Gen. Otis dircct him
to report to Gen. Merritt for duty under
his direction In the Philippine Islands. Gen.
Otis will be second in command and will
act as military governor of the islands in
ease of the absence or disability of Gen
Merritt.
Orders were also issued for the organiza­
tion of an army corps of about 12,(kjo men
for Immediate duty in the Philippine Is­
ands. This corps will be made up of regu­
lars and volunteer organizations stationed
on the Pacific coast and in the far western
states. General Merritt was at the War
Department today in consultation with the
becretary of War, General Miles and the
various bureau chiefs with regard to the
organization of the expedition. Prompt ac­
tion will be had in the matter with a view
to having the troops start on their long
voyage across the Pacific for the relief of
Admiral Dewey with as little delay as pos­
sible. General Merritt will leave here this
afternoon for New York, to settle up his
official and private affairs in that city pre­
paratory to his departure for San Francis­
co. Ho said that he did not know exactly
when he would sail from San Francisco,
but it was his purpose to do so as soon as
possible. The troops for the expedition

and they will be able to start for Manila
shortly after their arrival at San Francisco.

Morro battery, on the eastward arm
of the harbor, was the principal point of
attack. Rear Admiral Sampson and
Capt. Evans were on the lower bridge
of the lowa and had a narrow escape
from flying splinters, which injured
three men. The lowa was hit eight
times, but the shells made no Impres­
sion on her armor. The weather was
fine, but the heavy swells made ac­
curate aim difficult.
The broadsides from the lowa and
Indiana rumbled in the hills ashore for
five minutes after they were delivered.
Clouds of dust showed where the shells
struck, hut the smoke hung over' ev­
erything. The shells screeching over­
head and dropping around showed that
the Spaniards still stuck to their guns.
GENERAL QUARTERS.
At 3 o'clock in the morning all hands
were called on the lowa, and a few final
touches In clearing ship were made,
and at 5 ""general quarters"" sounded.
The men were eager for the fight.
The tug Wampatuck went ahead and I
anchored, her small boat to the west­
ward showing ten fathoms, but there
was not a sign of life from the fort,
which stood boldly against the sky on
the eastern hills hiding the town.
The Detroit steamed far to the east­
ward opposite Valtern. The lowa head­
ed straight for the shore. Suddenly her
helm flew over, bringing the starboard
battery to the near fortifications.
GUNS THUNDERED.
At 5:16 a. m. the lowa's forward
twelve-inch guns thundered out at the
sleeping hills and for fourteen minutes
she poured starboard broadsides on the
coast. Meanwhile, the Indiana, the New
York and other ships repeated the dose
from the rear.
The lowa turned and came back to
the Wampatuck's boat and again led
the column, the forts replying, con­
centrating their fire on the Detroit,
Which was about 700 yards away. All
the batteries were on the eastward
arm of the harbor.
Thrice the column passed from the
entrance of the harbor to the extreme
eastward battery.
Utter indifference was shown for the
enemy's fire. The wounded were quick- .
ly attended, the blood was washed
away and everything proceeded like
target practice.
At 7:45 a, m. Admiral Sampson sig­
naled ""Cease firing.""
4 ""Retire"" was sounded on the lowa
and she headed from the shore. The
Terror was the last ship in the line,
and failing to see the signal banged
away alone for half an hour, the con­
cert of shore guns roaring at her and
the water flying high around her from
the exploded shells.
But she possessed a charmed life and
reluctantly retired at 6:15.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059523/1898-05-14/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,mnhi_hallock_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Saint Paul globe.,[s.n.],"St. Paul, Minn.","","",3094,8357,2400,9317,1,18849,26316,0,mnhi_hallock_ver01/data/sn90059523/00206536962/1898051401/0144.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Paul%2C_Minnesota,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/mnhi_hallock_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn90059523%2F00206536962%2F1898051401%2F0144.jp2/pct:16.414664,31.756346,12.732771,35.404317/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/mnhi_hallock_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn90059523%2F00206536962%2F1898051401%2F0144.jp2/pct:16.414664,31.756346,12.732771,35.404317/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

tourists in Europe has, if official records
abroad are to be accepted as authentic,
increased enormously of late years.
There has been recently filed with the
Swiss minister of finance and customs
at Bern a detailed statement of hotel
receipts in that country, from which it
appears that the gross receipts of Swiss
hotels rose from 52,800,000 francs in
1880 to 114,383,000 in 1894. The entire
annual expenses of the Swiss republic
amount in a year to between 80,000,000
and 90,000,000 francs (the budget for
this year is given at the latter figure),
and it would seem, therefore, very much
as if the hotels of Switzerland take in
in a year more than the government it­
self does.

The Swiss figures are not the only
ones furnished in Europe recently on
this point A Frenoh record shows that
every year there are 2 70,000 foreigners
who pass from a fortpight to a whole
winter on the Riviem'^Every person is
supposed to expend on an average 1,000
franca, or $200, in the country. In oth­
er words, the foreign visitors spend in
the country every winter the sum of
$54,000,000. The English are put down
as contributing one-third of this amount
the French themselves contribute anoth­
er third Germans, Belgians, Dutch,
Russians and Americans contribute the
remainder. From being a poor country
when it was annexed to France in 1880
Nice has become one of the richest de­
partments of the republic.

Some figures recently compiled of the
revenues to hotels from tourists in Paris
show the average number of foreign
visitors to be 60,000. It is customary
to estimate at 10 francs, or $2, a day
the hotel bills of strangers in Paris.
Estimating at $2 a day each the hotel
bills of 60,000 tourists and at about as
much more their other outlays it is to
be seen that tourists in Paris can be put
down for an expenditure of nearly $250,­
000 a day.

The total sum expended by tourists
in Europe in a year is probably not very
far from $700,000,000, and a very con­
siderable portion of this comes from the
pockets, the purses and the bankers'
balances of Americans, who are pro­
verbially the most liberal among travel­
ers. Russians come second, Brazilians
third. —Exchange.

SLEEPWALKING.

Strange Things Men Do While I a State
of Somnambulism.

Readers of that charming work of my
late friend WilMe Collins, ""The Moon­
stone,"" will remember the sleepwalk­
ing feats of Mr. Franklin Blake when
under the influence of an opiate. ""What
the novelist describes as a piece of fic­
tion may be paralleled from the sober
records of science.

McNish, in his classic volume on
""Sleep,"" tells us of a shepherd lad who,
wrapt in slumber, walked miles to the
place where his flock was pastured,
waded through a river and returned
home without waking. In another case
a lad in his sleep scaled a precipitous
cliff and brought home from it an
eagle's nest, which was found under his
bed in the morning.

Abercrombie's case of the Scottish
lawyer who, when worried over a per­
plexing case, was seen by his wife to
rise from his bed in the night is an­
other illustration of the occasionally
purposive character of somnambulism,
when, directed by its private secretaries,
the sleeping ego is apparently roused
from its couch and made to act the part
of a pure automaton. This individual
went to a writing desk which stood, in
his bedroom, sat down before the desk
and wrote for some time. Then, replac­
ing the paper within the desk, he re­
turned to bed.

In the morning he told his wife of a
dream he had experienced, in which he
imagined he had given a satisfactory
opinion on the case which was trou­
bling his mind. He expressed regret
that he could not recall the train of
thought represented in his dream. On
his wife directing him to his writing
desk, he found therein the opinion in
question clearly written out and in
every respect satisfactory.—Andrew
Wilson, M. IX, in Harper's Magazine.

Have You Seen It?

Every big railroad in thisoountry has
a freight c^r in its equipment bearing
the number 12,345, and yet I'll lay
reasonable odds that yon may tramp
this town over and you will not be able
to find a man* I cave not how much he
has traveled, who has ever seen a car
with that number. Aiwrmg railroad
men it irknown'as the ''sequence car1'
or the ''one-two-three-four-fivo car.""
Perhaps you never looked for it I have.
For years in'my travels I made it a
practice to get out whenever the train
stopped and take a look at the freight
cars in sight, and have met drummers
who told me they did the same thing,
but never a glimpse did I get of that
car nor did I ever ran across a ~~y»
who had been so fortunate. Try it. Go
up to the freightyards in this city or
across the river. Ycmwill find hundreds
of cars, but it's $10 to a pint of peanuts
that car 12,845 will not be among them.

Mrs, Bolser Speaks for Many Care­
worn, Complaining* Women,

Women in charge of homes and oare­
worn. complaining people find their
strength permanently established by the
use of Paine’s celery compound, the
greatest nerve restorer and blood purifier
the world has ever been blessed with.
Try it, and when you go to the durg score
for Paine’s celery compound see that you
get it.
Mrs. Bolser speaks for countless women
who have suffered from aching backs,
worn and tired feelings, and have been
freod from pain and weakness by Paine’s
celery compound. Mrs. Bolser tells the
story of her deliverance from invalidism
in the two following letters:

Wells, Richardson & Co.,
Dear Sirs—Two years ago I came frjm
Nova Scotia, and I suppose my debili­
tated oondition was partially owing to
climatic influences. I used various kinds
of medicines, but continually grew weak­
er, until it was with difficulty that I
could gc up and down stairs, and in try­
ing to walk out of doors, could go only a
few steps when I would be obliged to lean
against a tree or sit down. 1 had read
frequently of Paine’s celery compound
and resolved to use it.
It put me on my feet again, so that I
began to take courage. I used several
bottles and I feel that 1 owe you a debt of

gratitude for the same. I recommend the
compound to my friends far and near.
Yours gratefully,
Mrs. C. B. Bolser.
After two years Mrs. Bolser still praisef
Paine’s celery compound.
St. Elmo, 'l'enn., June 33, 1896.
Dear Sirs—I still continue a friend and
well wisher of Paine’s celery compound,
and;have received replies from my friende
of its good results on my recommenda­
tion. I wish you continued success.
Yours truly,

The realistic Spanish novelist,
Valdes, In one of his most popular
stories (""Sister San Suplice,"" translated
by Nathan Haskell Dole) gives a de­
scription of a retired Spanish general's
afternoon out which will illuminate
many chivalric Incidents of the present
moment. The scene is a sort of picnic
grounds In the outskirts of Seville:
""Meantime the animation had been
on the increase among the sufflans.
The period of unmannerly action had
come. One of them climbed upon the
table to make a speech, and the others,
by way of applause, threw sherry and
Manzanllla in his face. Another was
trying to lift with his teeth a compan­
ion whom drunkenness had stretched
out on the floor; he did not succeed; he
merely tore his sack coat. Still others
were committing absurd and extrava­
gant actions, making a great noise and
Uproar.
""The count remained grave and si­
lent, drinking one glass of sherry after
another. But his eyes were no longer,
as usual, incomprehensible and un­
fathomable, like those of a man tired of
life. Though he did not speak or move
about, he seemed a different man.
""The Englishman had taken off his
jacket and waistcoat, and, rolling up
his shirt-sleeves, was exhibiting his bi­
ceps, which were really powerful, and
trying to break empty bottles on his
arm. Once blood had come, but he
went on breaking the bottles without
paying any attention to it. Then he
asked the waiter to bring a bottle of
rum and a large glass.' He filled this
to the brim with the liquor, and then
slowly without moving a muscle or
even winking, he drained It to the bot­
tom. Then he sat down at the table
opposite the count and said solemnly:
"" 'You can't do that.'
""A flash of fury gleamed through the
hare-brained nobleman's eyes; but he
succeeded in restraining himself, and,
turning the rest of the bottle into the
glass, he calmly ordered the waiter to
bring him some pepper; he threw in a
pinch of it, then threw into it his cigar
ashes heaped up before him, and, with­
out saying a word, with the same
scornful, contemptuous smile, drained
the glass, and, not content with that,
bit it in pieces. We saw his lips spot­
ted with blood. The company received
with oles! and shouts of triumph this
proof of an unconquerable stomach, in
which It seemed as though the national
honor were conquered. ,
""Our neighbors in trie other booths
must have reached the same happy
grade of temperature, for nothing was
heard but extravagant shouts, the
crashing of glasses, coarse laughter and
swearing. '
The count was not yet satisfied with
his victory over the Englishman.
While he iVas swallowing with appa­
rent calmness the glasses of liquor
which were offered to him, he did not
cease to devour him with his eyes, car­
ried away by a dull madness, which
soon broke out. His eyes, which were
the only part of his impassive face
that moved, gleamed more and more fe­
rociously, like those of a madman when
a strait-jacket has been put on him.
The Englishman continued to boast of
his strength; he was now thoroughly
Intoxicated and talking impudently
enough to the others, who were not so
drunk.
"" 'So you are very valiant, are you?'
asked the count, still smiling disdain­
fully."" 'More than you!' retorted the Eng­
lishman.""Don Jenaro started to spring at
him, but the others restrained him.
Soon calming himself, he said:
"" 'If you are so brave, why not put
your hand on the table?'
"" 'What for?'
' 'To pin it down with mine.' ?
""The Englishman, without an in­
stant's hesitation, stretched out his
huge, brawny hand. The count took
out of his pocket a damaskeened dag­
ger and laid his delicate; gentlemanly
hand on the Englishman's; and with­
out hesitation, and with a ferocious
grip, he raised the point with the other
and drove It through both into the ta­
ble..""The women uttered a cry of terror.
All of us men ran to their assistance.
A few left the place In search of help.
In an instant our booth was Ailed with
blood. From the wounds great drops
of blood streamed, staining the hand­
kerchiefs which we applied to them.
""A doctor who happened to be among
the by-standers dressed the wounds
provisionally with the few means at his
disposal. The count smiled while they
were dressing his hand. The English­
man was as sick as a horse and vom­
iting. Soon the count was doing the
same, and both were taken to such
rooms as the establishment had to of­
fer and went to bed; every one left,
commenting on the barbarism of the
dons.""","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84020358/1898-06-23/ed-1/seq-10,"","",10,"","",1,ct_ash_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The daily morning journal and courier.,Carrington Pub.

ground of observation from one field of
observation to another to make this
statement, and when the assertions go

to far as to exclude from the domain of

science those who will not be dragged

into this mire of mere assertion then it
is time to protest.""
With vmal vehemence against the
doctriaw of evolution Hugh Miller,
Farraday, Brewster, Dana, Dawson and
hundreds of scientists in this country
and other countries have made protest.
I know that the few men who have
adopted the theory make more noise
than the thousands who have rejected
it. The Bothnia of the Cunard line took
600 passengers safely from New York
to Livorpool. Not one of tho BOO made
any excitement. But after we had been
four days out, one morning, we found
on deck a man's hat and coat and vest
and boots, implying that some one had
jumped overboard. Forthwith we all
began to talk about that one man. There
was more talk about that one man over­
board than all the 600 passengers that
rode on in safety. ""Why did he jump
overboard?"" ""I wonder when he jumped
overboard?"" ""I wonder if when he
jumped overboard he would liked to
have jumped back again?"" ""I wonder if
a fish caught him or whether he went
olear down to the bottom of the sea?""
And for three or four days afterward
we talked about that poor man.
A Glorloua Theory.
Hero is the glorious and magnificent
theory that God by his omnipotent pow­
er made man, and by his omnipotent
power made the brute creation, and by
his omnipotent power made all worlds,
and COO scientists have taken passage
on board that magnificent theory, but
10 or 15 have jumped overboard. They
make more talk than all the 500 that
did not jump. I am politely asked to
jump with them. Thank yon, gentle­
men, I ain very much obliged to you. I
think I shall stick to the old Cuuardcr.
If you want to jump overboard, jump
and test for yourselves whether your
hand was really a fish's fin, and wheth­
er you were webfooted originally, and
whether your lungs aro a swim blad­
der. And as in every experiment there
must be a division of labor, sonio who
experiment and some who observe, you

make the experiment and I will observe
There is one tenet of evolution which
it is demanded we adopt, that which
Darwin calls ""natural selection,"" and

that which Wallace called tho ""survival
of tho fittest. "" By this tbey mean that
the human race and the brute creation

are ull the time improving because the
weak die and the strong live. Those
who do not die survive because they are
the fittest. They say the breed of sheep
and cattle and dogs and men is all the

time improving, naturally improving.
No need of God or any Biblo or any re­
ligion, but just natural progress.

You see the race started with ""spon

taneous generation,"" and then it goes
right on until Darwin can take us np

with his ""natural selection, and Wal­
lace with his ""survival of tho fittest,""
and so we go right on up forever.

Beautiful! But do the fittest survive?

brave northern men marching out to

Hundreds of thousands of them went
down into the grave trenches. We

staid at home in comfortable quarters.
Did they die becau. they were not as

not the ""survival of the fittest."" Ells­

ston and Stonewall Jackson falling on

cause they were not as fit to livo as the
soldiers and the generals who came
back iu safety? No. Bitten with the

frosts of the second death be the tongue

noblest, grandest men dying iu youth or

Not ""tho survival of the fittest.""

But to show you tha this doctrine is

nntaconistio to the Bible and to common

sense I have only to prove to you that

there has been no uatural progress.

went into the cathedral at York, Eng­
land, and tho best artists in England
had just been painting a window in that
cathedral, and right beside it was a
window painted 400 years ago, and
there is not a man on earth but would
say that the modem painting of the
window by the best artists of England
is not worthy of being compared with
the painting of 400 years ago right be­
side it. Vast improvement, as I shall

Trend of Evolution,
. T,nnk nt iChiua.' where evolution has

had full svfing for thousands of years
uninterrupted by anything except here
and there k mission. station with this

defunct bookrthe Bible, but through
the most of the realm not interfered
with. What has evolution done for
China? Christian civilization goes in
and builds a railroad ; they tear it up.
For 1,000 years the Chinese nation,
where it is not invaded by tho gospol,
has not made one-flve-hundred-millionth
part of an inch of advancement. Thoy
worship the same gods of red paint.
Just as always, they drown the fomale
children as a nuisance Just as always,
they eat with chopstioks. So in India,
so in Arabia, so in Turkey, so every­
where where the gospel has not made
an invasion.
I tell you, my friends, that natural
evolution is not upward but it is always
downward. Hear Christ's account of it.
Fifteenth Matthew aud nineteenth
verse, ""Out of the heart proceed evil
thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornica­
tions, thefts, false witness, blasphe­
mies. "" That? is what Christ said of evo­
lution. Give natural evolution full
swing in our world and it will evolve
into two hemispheres of crime, two
hemispheres of penitentiary, two hem­
ispheres of lazaretto, two hemispheres
of brothel. New York Tombs, Moya­
mensing prison, Philadelphia, Seven
Dials, London and Cowgate, Edinburgh,
only festering carbuncles on the face
and neck of natural evolution. See
what the Bible says about the heart
and then what evolution says about the
heart. Evolution says ""better and bet­
ter and better gets tho heart by natural
improvement."" The Bible says: ""The
heart is deceitful above all things and
dosperately wicked. Who can know it?""
When you can evolve fragrance from
malodor, and can evolve an oratorio
from a buzzsaw, and 'an eyolve fall
pippins from a basket of decayed crab
apples, then you can by natural evolu­
tion from the human heart develop
goodness. Ah, my friends, natural evo­
lution is always downward; it is never
upward.
A Galvanized Corpae.
What is remarkable about this thing
is it is all the time developing its dis

honesty. In our day it is ascribing this

evolution to Herbert Spencer and
Charles Darwin. It is a dishonesty.

Evolution was known and advocated

hundreds of years before these gentle
men began to ba evolved. The Phoeni

cians thousands of years ago declared
that the human race wabbled out of the

mud. Democritus, who lived 400 years

before Christ romember that knew
this doctrine of evolution when he said:

Everything is composed of atoms, or

infinitely small elements, each with a

definite quality, form and movement,

whose inevitable union and separation

ihape all different things and forms,

laws and efforts and dissolve them
again for new combinations. The gods
themselves and the human mind orig­
inated from Ruch atoms. There are no
casualties. Everything is necessary and
determined by the nature of tho atoms

which have certain mutual affinities,
attractions and repulsions."" Anoxi­
mander centuries ago declared that the

human race started at the place where
the sea saturated the earth. Luoretius
developed long centuries ago in his

poems the doctrine of evolution.

It is an old heathen corpse sot np iu

a morgue. (Jharles uarwin ana neroeri
Spencer have tried to galvanize it.
They drag this old putrefaction of

8.000 years around the eartn, boasting

that it is their originality, and so won

derful is the infatuation that at the
Delmonico dinner given in honor of
Herbert Spencer some 15 years ago
there were those who ascribed to him

this great originality of evolution.
There the banqueters sat around the

table in honor of Herbert Spencer, chew

ing beef and turkey and roast pig, which,
according to their doctrine of evolution,
made them eating their own relations.
Slicing up their own cousins! Driving
a carving fork into their beloved kin­

A Glorloua Doctrine.
There is only one thing worse than

English snobbery, and that is Ameri­
can snobbery. I like democracy and I

like aristocracy, but there is one Kina
of ocracy in this country that excites

my contempt, and that is wnac unaries
vintrBlRv. after he had witnessed it

himself, called suobocracy. Now, I say

it is a gigantio dishonesty when tney
ascribe this old heathen doctrine of
evolution to any modern gentleman.

I am not a pessimist, but an optimist.
I do not believe everything is going to
destruction; I believe everything is go­
ing on to redemption. But it will not
be through the infidel doctrine of evolu­
tion, but through our glorious Chris­
tianity which has effected all the good
that has ever been wrought and which
is yet to reconstruct all The nations.
What is that in the offing? A ship
gone on the rocks at Cape Hatteras.
The hulk is breaking up, crew and pas­
sengers are drowning. The storm is in
full blast and the barometer is still
sinking. What does that ship want?
Development. Develop her broken
masts. Develop her broken rudder. De­
velop her drowniug crew. Develop her
freezing passengers. Develop the whole
ship. That is all it wants. Develop­
ment. Oh, I make a miptako. What

Mount Clare, Baltimore, and It Is noted
as being the location of the first tele­

The magnificent building at the corner
of Eighteenth and Arch streets, Philadel­
phia, is a monument that tells what a
great charity is the Women's Christian
Association of the Quaker City.
The superintendent of the W. C. A.
home is the accomplished woman whose
portrait is printed here, Miss Katharine
Kennedy. What she has done and what
she is doing for the benefit of other
women commands the highest respect
and admiration.
In all other institutions of this kind
more attention is given every year to
teaching the laws of health and right
living, physically as well as morally.
The health of communities is more and
more frequently a subject of attention
from clergymen and teachers. An ailing,
nervous man or woman finds it more
difficult to be hopeful and cheerful and
good than a well one.
Writing to the Wells, Richardson
Company, who are the proprietors of
the most wonderful of all remedies for
the cure of diseases that arise from the
impairment of the nervous system,
Paine's celery compound, Miss Kennedy,
in the course of her letter, referring to

In the Phlla-
tinue the use of it."" So many women
run down in health by overwork, or
what is worse, overworry, have been
restored to perfect health by Paine's cel­
ery compound, that its record in the
Philadelphia home has been duplicated
in every large city in the Union. Grate­
ful testimonials of this character have
been published time and again in these­
columns, and it is a fact that no other
remedy has ever received a hundredth of
the hearty blessings that the managera
of public institutions have openly ac
corded to Paine's celery compound.
The widespread use of Paine's celery
compound, in the most intelligent, care­
ful homes, and among the most thought­
ful portions of every community, has
grown up by just this sort of personal
guarantee, by word of mouth, from per­
sons made strong and well to others
needing exactly the kind of invigoration
and toning up that Paine's celery com­
pound gives.
In time of great mental strain, when
other remedies only meddle and muddle,
Paine's celery compound feeds the hard­
pressed nerves. .
Paine's celery compound purifies the
blood of all bad humors, and cures the
many ailments from this familiar cause.
A vast proportion of all diseases are
preventable. Paine's celery compound is
universally prescribed by medical men to
stop the progress of disorders, due to
poor blood and badly nourished nerves.

PARIS, Nov. 19, 1898.—The American
Peace Commissioners today have been
closely engaged in formulating the terms
of the important communication to be
made to the Spanish Commissioners next
week. It is impossible at present, how­
ever, to determine whether the work will
be completed for presentation on Monday
or Tuesday, though it is believed the
Americans will be ready on Monday.
While the Americans fully appreciate
the necessity of making progress, they
are also under the necessity of taking
great care in the preparation of what
may posibly be the conclusive record of
these negotiations.
The Spanish Commissioners consumed a
week in the preparation of the last mem­
orandum; but the Americans will not re­
quire so long a time to complete the work
in hand, and any present delay will ulti­
mately prove to have been advantageous.

It is no? conceded by eminent
scientists that the most important or­
gans of the whole body are the kidney s.
Tney filter your blood and work
away night and day, whether you sleep
or are awake.
People are apt to believe that kidney
disease is a ratner rare disease, but re
cent discoveries have proven that it is
a most common trouble.
And tha proDJ of this is that most
diaeaees, perhaps 85 per cent, are caud
in the beiginntng oy disorders of the
kidneys.
BKUAU3K they fail to filter your
blood.
You cannot be sick if your blood is
pure free from kidney prison and
disease breeding germs.
The treatment of some diseases may
be delayed without danger, not so wiih
kidney disease.
When your kidneys are not doing
their work it will b9 manifested by
pain or dull ache in the back, rheuma
tic pains, eciatica, sediment in the
urine, scanty supply, scalding irrita­
tion in passing ic, obliged to go often
during the day and to get up during
the night, uric acid, sleeplessness,
nervousness irritability, saliiw, un­
healthy complexion, puffy or dark
circles under the eyes, loss of energy
and ambition.
If your water when allowed to remain
undisturbed for twenty four nours
forms a sediment or settling or han a
cloudy appearance, it is evidence that
your kidneys and bladder need lmine­
d ate attention.

It has been a custom in all Christian
lands for people to keep watch night aa
an old year goes out and a new year
comes in. People assemble in churches
about 10 o'clock of that last night of
the old year, and they have prayers and
songs and sermons and congratulations
until the hands of the church clock al
most reach the figure 12, and then all
bow in silent prayer, and the scene is
mightily impressive until the clock in
the tower of the church or tho clock in
the tower of the city hall strikes 12, and
then all rise and sing with smiling face
and jubilant voice the grand doxology,
and there is a shaking of hands all
around.
But what a tremendous watch night
the world is soon to celebrate! This
century will depart at 12 o'clock of the
31st of December, of the year 1900.
What a night that will be, whether
starlit or moonlit or dark with tempest!
It will be such a night as you and I
never saw. Those who watched the
coming in of, the nineteenth century
long ago went to their pillows of dust.
Here and there one will see the new
century arrive who saw this century
enter, yet they were too infantile to ap-'
preciate the arrival. But on tbc watch
night of which I speak, in all neighbor­
hoods and towns and cities and conti­
nents, audiences will assemble and bow
in prayer, waiting for the last breath,
of the dying century, and when thef
clock shall strike 12, there will be a
solemnity and an overwhelming awe

such as has not been felt for 100 years,
and then all the people will arise and
chant the welcome of a uv century of
joy and sorrow, of triumph nnd defeat,
of happiness and woo, and neighborhood
will shake hands with neighborhood
and church with church and city with
city and continent with continent and

hemisphere with hemisphere and earth'
with heaven at the stupendous departure
and the majestic arrival. May wo all be
living on earth to see the Bolcmuitios
and join in tho songs and shako hands
in the congratulations","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84022871/1898-11-28/ed-1/seq-6,"","",6,"","",1,vtu_middlebury_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Orleans County monitor.,E.H.

The Baltimore Sun eays that the late
""William B. Smallbridge, of Glenville,
West Virginia, a veteran of the civil
war, carried a bullet in his heart for
thirty-seven years. His death was not
due to the presence of the bullet, and,
in fact, he never suffered any incon­
venience from it. Before his death he
asked his physician, In the interest of
science, to make an autopsy in order
to find the bullet. The physician did so,
and found it Imbedded in the heart.

A CLEAN MAN.
Outside cleanliness is less than half
the battle. A man may scrub himself a
dozen times a day, and
still be unclean. Good
health means cleanliness
not only outside, but in­
side. It means a clean
stomach, clean bowels,
clean blood, a clean
liver, and new, clean,
healthy tissues and fi­
bers in every organ of
the body. The man
who is clean in this
way will look it and act
it. He will work with
energy and think clean, clear, healthy
thoughts.
He will never be troubled with liver.
lung, stomach or blood disorders. Dys­
pepsia and indigestion originate in
unclean stomachs. Blood diseases are
found where there is unclean blood.
Consumption and bronchitis
mean unclean lungs. tir.
Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery prevents these

Auckland, N. Z., Jan.19. Further par­
ticulars regarding the disturbances at
Samoa show that Mataafas followers
numbered about 600 and that the adher­
ents of Melietoa Tanus were only
about 1,000. There was two hours fight­
ing Ibetween the rival forces during
which several of the warriors were de­
capitated.' The American consul issued a procla­
mation claiming that the Berlin treaty
had the same force as a law of congress
and that an insult to the supreme court
of Samoa is therefore equivalent to an
insult to the government at Washing­

Motto of a club man—“ Late to bed
and early to ryes.”
The more of nobody a man la the
more important he thinks he is.
Patience is all right in its place,
but it is better to back tenacity to win.
Gov. Roosevelt has already begun to
“restarch” the civil service of New
York.
But few people are satisfied with
their fortune or dissatisfied with their
own wit.
—* 
After a politician has been dead
thirty or forty years he is sometimes
referred to as a statesman.
When a man steals he does it for
himself; but when a woman steals she
does it for some worthless man.
That embalmed beef certainly had
whiskers on it, but Eagan is the fel­
low who had the closest shave.
Of all meddlers, there is none who
get it in the solar plexus quite so
hard as those who meddle with love.
A man can sometimes learn a great
deal by studying the disposition of
women—but the tuition usually comes
high.
Emperor William says our war with
Spain was justified, but Charles Eliot
Norton is supposed to hold to his
original opinion.
Mrs. Hetty Green is trying to have
her Chicago taxes lowered. Fighting
taxes and making money constitute
her chief diversions.
The story comes from San Francisco
that Tod Sloan has won $400,000 in the
stock market, but perhaps it would be
just as well to drop all the ciphers.
Vice-President Hobart led the prom­
enade at New York’s charity ball, thus
showing that a vice-president some­
times serves a useful purpose, after
all.
Let us be just and fair. No Cuban
soldiers have applied for pensions on
account of disabilities incurred while
raiding the United States commissary
stores or by falling out of insecure
hammocks.
Eleven Spanish warships are report­
ed to be coaling at Fort de France,
Martinique, prior to their departure
for Spain. Where did Spain succeed
in hiding these vessels when the war
was going on?
At a recent competition In designs
for book covers in London prizes were
awarded for two which had been sub­
mitted by a “Miss Matthews.” It was
not until some time afterward that it
was revealed that “Miss Matthews”
was the Princess Victoria of Wales,
daughter of the heir-apparent to the
British throne. None of the other
competitors, nor the judges, nor any of
her own family, had any idea that she
was among the competitors.
Some of the subscribers of an anti-
Jewish fund in Paris express senti­
ments more fit for fiends than for hu­
man beings. Thus one woman sends
twenty-five cents ""out of her hatred
for the Jews and in the hope that
Reinach may be skinned alive.” Her
two-yenr-old daughter sends—or is
made to send—five cents, and her hus­
band sends thirty cents, “In the hope
that Reinach may be boiled in oil.”
Another professedly devout woman,
of venerable age, sends her mite with
the assurance that she is “praying day
and night that the Jews may be ex­
terminated by the plague.” When
unreasoning bigotry arises to such o
pitch, it is a short step to another St.
Bartholomew’s.
A table compiled by a New York
paper gives ninety-two trusts formed
during 1808, and embracing every de­
partment of industry. Their aggre­
gate capitalization is shown to be
$1,292,749,200, of which $957,957,300 i 3
common stock and $334,791,900 pre­
ferred. Their bonded Indebtedness will
increase the total to over $1,500,000,-
000. A few comparisons will enable
one to grasp the meaning of this great
capital. The total value of the United
States wheat crop of 189 G is placed at
$310,602,539—levs than one-third of the
capital of the 1898 trusts. The value
of all horses in the United States in
1897 was estimated at $452,649,396.
The value of mineral products in 1896
was $623,717,288; sheep In 1897, $67,-
020,942; milch cows In 1897, $3G9,239,-
993. The value of sugar consumed in
this country is now about $220,000,000
a year. Tho total of wages paid in
the sugar refining industry is about
$2,000,000—less thun one six-hundredth
of the new trust capital of 1898.
The year 1898 opened with conditions
exceedingly favorable for tomato pack­
ers In this country, who began making
large sales for futuro delivery early in
January, and which led to a great in­
crease In the acreage. Tho result, os
shown by the nineteenth annual report
of the American Grocer, is a total out­
put of not less than *5,797,806 cases of
two dozen tins each, against 4,149,441
cases in 1897—an lncreuse of 1,648,365
cases, or about 39 per cent. The pack
of 1898 is next to the largest on rec­
ord, falling behind the heavy 1894 pack
by 789,173 cases.

There is a little story going the rounds
regarding the rewards given soldiers. It
is said that in battle the privates occupy
the firing line, the corporals aie one yard
in the rear of the privates, the segeants
five yards in the iear of the corporals,
the lieutenants twenty-five yards in the
rear of the sergeants, the captains one
hundred and twenty-five jards-in the
rear of the lieutenants, the majors two
hundred yards in the rear of the cap­
tains, the colonel five hundred yards in
the rear of the majors, the general five
thousand yards in the rear of the colon­
el, while the commanding general is at
Washington, D. C. After the battle the

as one of Its first results, the starva­

I freely admit all this, it yet remains
true that a corporation which derives
Its powers from the state, should pay to
the state a just percentage of its earn­

enjoys. This should be especially true
for the franchises bestowed upon gas
companies, street railways and the like.
The question of municipal ownership of
these franchises cannot be raised with
propriety until the governments of all
municipalities show greater wisdom and

Maximo Gomez Informed Governor Gen­
eral Brooke today that he must withdraw
from the plan for distributing the $3,000,­
000 appropriated to the payment of the
Cuban troops to the extent that he will
not name other commissioners to replace
those originally named by him who have
refused to serve.
Governor General Brooke Is to go ahead
with a new plan, Gomez remaining In an
attitude of friendly inactivity.
General Urjoke will issue an order for
Cuban privates and ncn-commissioned
officers to meet at sj>eclfied places on
specified dates to receive payment. They
are to be aooompanled by their oompany
officers for the purpose of Identification.

lose their share in the American gratuity
merely because the schemes of certain
high officers In the Cuban army have in­
terposed obstacles. The belief among the
Americans is that the company officers
will assist in this way.
General Brooke’s order will be dissemi­
nated through the newspapers, placarded
In the post offioes and given the wildest
circulation practicable. This afternoon
Gen. Gomez wrote a history of his reJa­
tioh to the army payment question. It
includes the correspondence that has
passed between himself and the governor
general and it is intended to make his
position clear to the public and to con­
trast his conduct favorably with that of
other Cuban leaders.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016025/1899-05-16/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,me_jonesport_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Portland daily press.,N.A.

New York, July G. Manufacturers of
imitation Jewelry have lately met with
such great success that it is said the sale
of genuine Jewelry In this city Is les3
tban ever before, and It is also said on
good authority, that large-amounts of cap­
ital are soon to be invested in the manu­
facture of imitation Jewelry. For some
time past it has been possible to obtain
imitation Jewelry In Trance and England
which is difficult of detection by experts;
but the business has never before b""en
taken up In this country to any great ex­
tent.The principal manufacturers expect to
deal in Jewelry of their own manufacture,
which is said to be extraordinarily fine Im­
itations of the real stones, and will have a
guaranteed life of twenty years The ""di­
amonds"" are a composition of glas3, lead,
and carbon, tipped with platinum, which
13 harder than gold. Every real stone, ex­
cept a diamond, is transparent: without
the tip of platinum these ""diamonds""
would also be transparent, but with it
they are given an undetectable resem­
blance to the genuine stone. These goods
are mounted in fourteen -carat gold, anil
so artistically that when worn the plat­
Irum tipping cannot be seen. An infinite
variety of designs, copied from the bast
real models, are shown, and at a price
vhich is about SO per cent les3 than the
genuine.
All the colored stones rubies, sapphires,
emeralds, and turquoises are also manu­
factured in a like way, and are similar,
with the exception of the turquoise, to the
doublet, except that they are much harder.
and are made cf real stone (garnet) and
crjstai. They are so hard that the surface
can be tiled and no blemish made on the
stone. As genuine pearls are the most cost­
ly of gems, so do the Imitation pearls take
the lead In price. They are made of fish­
skin and a secret composition. The manu­
facture of some especially good imitation
pearls, known as ""Venetian pearls,' 'Is a
lost art, the process having been invented
by a poor Venetian, whose secret died
with him. There arc about 10,000 of them
In this country, bought in Paris about
ten j ears ago; they are very hard, can be
stepped on without sustaining the slight­
est injury, and will also bounce like a
rubber ball. The difficulty In the manufac­
ture of pearls Is in obtaining the orient,
or lustre, similar to the genuine gems,
and it is ald that, very often out of
10,000 manufactured few will be marketa­
ble, and they are almost as difficult to
match for necklaces as the real. A dog
collar of imitation pearls, with ""diamond""
clasps would cost about $250
It is said thit most of the imitation Jewel
business done is with rcfiped women of
wealth, who have their genuine pearls co­
pied, or buy a novel design which serves
the purrose of a fad as well as the gen­
uine.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85054468/1899-07-07/ed-1/seq-5,"","",5,"","",1,dlc_franklin_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The times.,W.S.

fixed on him he Is as certainly bound
for a drunkard's grave as that a train
starting out from the Grand Central
depot at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning
Is bound for Albany. The train may
not reach Albany, for it may be thrown
from the track. The young man may
not reach a drunkard's grave, for.
something may throw him off the iron
track of evil habit. But the proba­
bility is that the train that starts to­
morrow morning at 8 o'clock for Al­
bany will get there, and the proba­
bility is that the young man who has
the habit of strong drink fixed on him
before 25 or 30 years of age will ar­
rive at a drunkard's grave. She knows
he drinks, although he tries to hide it

by chewing cloves. Everybody knows
he drinks. Parents warn; neighbors
and friends warn. She will marry him;
she will reform him. If she is unsuc­
cessful In the experiment, why, then,
the divorce law will emancipate her,
because habitual drunkenness is a
cause for divorce in Indiana, Ken­
tucky, Florida, Connecticut and nearly
all the states. So the poor thing goes
to the altar of sacrifice. If you will
show me the poverty struck streets in
any city, I will show you the homes
of the women who married men to re­
form them. In one case out of ten
thousand it may be a successful experi­
ment. I never saw the successful ex­
periment. But have a rigorous divorce
law, and that woman will say, ""If I
am affianced to that man, it is for life,
and If now, in the ardor of his young
love and I the prize to be won, he will
not give up his cups, when he has won
the prize surely he will not give up his
cups."" And so that woman will say to
the man: ""No, sir; you are already
married to the club, and you are mar­
ried to that evil habit, and so you are
married twice, and you are a bigamist.
Go!""
Hasty Marriages.
A rigorous divorce law will also do
much to hinder hasty and inconsid­
erate marriages. Under the impres­
sion that one can be easily released
people enter the relation without in­
quiry and without reflection. Romance
and impulse rule the day. Perhaps the
only ground for the marriage compact
is that she likes his looks, and he ad­
mires the graceful way she passes
around the ice cream at the picnic! It
Is all they know about each other. It
is all the preparation for life. A man
not able to pay his own board bill,
with not a dollar in his possession,
will stand at the altar and take the
loving hand and say, ""With all my
worldly goods I thee endow."" A wo­
man that could not make a loaf of
bread to save her life will swear to
love and keep him in sickness and in
health. A Christian will marry an
atheist, and that always makes con­
joined wretchedness, for if a man does
not believe there is a God he is neither
to be trusted with a dollar nor with
your lifelong happiness. Having read
much about love in a cottage, people
brought up in ease will go and starve
in a hovel. Runaway matches and
elopements, nine hundred and ninety­
nine out of a thousand of which mean
death and hell, multiplying on all
hands. You see them in every day's
newspapers.
Our ministers in some regions have
no defense such as they have In other
regions where the banns must be pre­
viously published and an officer of the
law must give a certificate that all is
right, so clergymen are left defense­
less and unite those who ought never
to be united. Perhaps they are too
young, or perhaps they are standing
already in some domestic compact. By
the wreck of ten thousand homes, by
the holocaust of ten thousand sacri­
ficed men and women, by the hearth­
stone of the family, which is the cor­
nerstone of the state, and in the name
of that God who hath set up the fam­
ily institution and who hath made the
breaking of the marital oath the most
appalling of all perjuries, I implore the
congress of the United States to make
some righteous, uniform law for all
the states and from ocean to ocean on
this subject of marriage and divorce.
Warning to the Young:.
Let me say to all young people, be­
fore you give your heart and hand in
holy alliance, use all caution. Inquire
outside as to habits, explore the dispo­
sition, scrutinize the taste, question
the ancestry and find out the ambi­
tions. Do not take the heroes and
the herojnes of cheap novels for a mod­
el. Do not put your lifetime happi­
ness in the keeping of a man who has
a reputation of being a little loose in
morals or In the keeping of a woman
who dresses immodestly. Remember
that, while good looks are a kindly
gift of God, wrinkles or accident may
despoil them. Remember that Byron
was no more celebrated for his beauty
than for his depravity. Remember
that Absalom's hair was not more
splendid than his habits were despica­
ble. Hear it! Hear It! The only foun­
dation for happy marriage that ever

bas been or ever will"" be Is good' char­
acter.Ask thy counsel of father and moth­
er In this most important step of your
life. They are good advisers. They
are the best friends you ever had.
They made more sacrifices for you
than any one else ever did, and they
will do more today for your happi­
ness than any other people. Ask them,
and, above all, ask God. I used to
smile at John Brown of Haddington
because, when he was about to offer
his hand and heart in marriage to one
who became his lifelong companion,
he opened the conversation by saying,
""Let us pray."" But I have seen so
many shipwrecks on the sea of mat­
rimony I have made up my mind that
John Brown of Haddington was right
A union formed in prayer will be a
happy union, though sickness pale the
cheek and poverty empty the bread
tray and death open the small graves
and all the path of life be strewn with
thorns, from the marriage altar, with
its wedding march and orange blos­
soms, clear on down to the last fare­
well at that gate where Isaac and Re­
becca, Abraham and Sarah, Adam and
Eve, parted. And let me say to you
who are in this relation, If you make
one man or woman happy you have not
lived in vain. Christ says that what
he is to the church you ought to be to
each other, and if sometimes, through
difference of opinion or difference of
disposition, you make up your mind

that your marriage was a mistake pa­
tiently bear and forbear, remembering
that there Is a glory in the patient en­
durance of a sad yoke. Life at the
longest Is short, and for those who
have been badly mated in this world
death will give quick and final bill of
divorcement written In letters of green
grass on quiet graves. And perhaps,
my brother, my sister, perhaps you
may appreciate each other better in
heaven than you have appreciated each
other on earth.
A Divine Institution.
In the ""Farm Ballads"" our Ameri­
can poet puts into the lips of a re­
pentant husband, after a life of mar­
ried perturbation, these suggestive
words:
And when Bhe dies I wish that she would be laid
by me.
And, lying together in silence, perhaps we will
agree.
And if ever we meet in heaven I would not think
it queer
If we love each other better because we quarreled
here.
And let me say to those of you who
are in happy married union, avoid first
quarrels; have no unexplained corre­
spondence with former admirers; cul­
tivate no suspicions; in a moment of
bad temper do not rush out and tell
the neighbors; do not let any of those
gadabouts of society unload in your
house their baggage of gab and tittle
tattle; do not make it an invariable
rule to stand on your rights; learn how
to apologize; do not be so proud or so
stubborn or so devilish that 3-ou will
not make up. Remember that the
worst domestic misfortunes and most
scandalous divorce cases started from
little infelicites. The whole piled up
train of ten rail cars telescoped and
smashed at the foot of an embank­
ment 100 feet down came to that ca­
tastrophe by getting two or three inch­
es off the track. Some of the greatest
domestic misfortunes and the widest
resounding divorce cases have started
from little misunderstandings that
were allowed to go on and go on until
home and respectability and religion
and immortal soul went down in the
crash.
Fellow citizens as well as fellow
Christians, let us have a divine rage
against anything that wars on the mar­
riage state. Blessed institution! In­
stead of two arms to fight the battle
of life, four; instead of two eyes to
scrutinize the path of life, four; in­
stead of two shoulders to lift the bur­
den of life, four; twice the energy,
twice the courage, twice the holy am­
bition, twice the probability of world­
ly success, twice the prospects of
heaven. Into that matrimonial bower
God fetches two souls. Outside the
bower, room for all contentions, and
all bickerings, and all controversies,
but inside that bower there is room for
only one guest the angel of love. Let
that angel stand at the floral doorway
of this Edenic bower with drawn
sword to hew down the worst foe of
that bower easy divorce. And for ev­
ery paradise lost may there be a para­
dise regained. And after we quit our
home here may we have a brighter
home in heaven, at the windows of
which, this moment, are familiar faces
watching for our arrival and wonder­
ing why so long we tarry.

The faculty of terse and forceful speech
is ordinarily an advantage, but occasion­
ally a man gets hoisted by his own epi­
gram. A hustling young New Yorker
who was recently established in a branch
of The oil business had set out to get the
patronage of a certain firm. The head of
the concern was reluctant to make a
change.
""The oil we have been getting has not
been unsatisfactory,' said he, ""and I fail
to see why we should make a change. Are
there any extra inducements you can of­
fer? How do you propose to improve on
the old quality?""
""In this way,' was the prompt answer.
""I propose to give the business my personal
attention. I intend to put some of my
brains Into every barrel of oil we send out.""
The rejoinder pleased the old gentleman,
and he became a customer.
A lew months later the hustling young
man was o.biged to make a journey and
in his absence through some oversight the
quality of 'il was allowed to deteriorate.
It was quickly noted, and a letter now on
filit in the ottice records one of the pro­
tests. It reads: ""Genuiemen: When we
were induced to use your product we were
assured that Mr. Blank pat s rie of his

THUS MEN DISAPPEAR
STORY OF ONE WHO CHOSE TO DROP
OUT OF SICHT.
Harvey IV. Rocera Left His Home Near
Buffalo to Visit the Cenfennlal-of *7C
arid Has Ju*t Returned-His Wander­
ing*-Slaters' F.-Torts to Find Ililli.
Twenty-three years ago last July
Harvey W. Rogers, n railroad station
ageut at Hamberg, n suburb of Buf­
falo, N. Y., left his position, borne,
friends and a comfortable fortuue to
go to the Centennial exposition in
Philadelphia. He bas since been a
wanderer up and down the country
from one extreme to the other, bat
never returned to lits home. He bad
no trouble or cause to remain* away,
but, on the contrary, every induce­
ment was made to him to return home.
Not once in that time did he commu­
nicate with, his relatives, and they,
hoping almost against hope tnat he
was still alive, have been steadfastly
searching for him for more than a
score of years.
Their diligence was rewarded oue
day last week, when a meetiug be­
tween Bogers and his family was
effected at the office of his attorney,
Mr. David I. Gitt, 023 F street, in
this city. It was through the efforts
of the latter that Rogers' sisters were
enabled to find their long-lost brother
and that they came hero from Buff.ilo
to meet him. Their recognitions
were mutual, and while the women
wept for joy, ihe old man was so over­
come by emotion that for a few min­
utes he could hardly speak.
The story of tb.3 eventful life of the
old mau, now sixty-two years of age,
is an interesting narrative. His
father was a well-to-do farmer in Erie
county, and possessed a hue tract of
laud in what is now a growing sub­
urb of Buffalo.
""When Rogers, was a boy the land
was reckoned to be worth about ?50
an acre; now SSO, OOO would scarce
purchase that much of it. When a
young man he enlisted in the Ninth
New York cavalry aud served through­
out the civil strife. There the ro­
mance of his nature developed. The
life was to him rather shiftless and
aimless, and he became imbued wi'h
the spirit of a wanderer. However,
he returned home after the war was
over and went to work on the rail­
road.
His father died, some of tho estate
was sold, and by economy Rogers
managed to acquire a considerable
sum of money. He kept au account
iu a savings bank, loaned money on
mortgages, had a good position as
station agent and became well-to-do.
Still he was never wholly conteuted.
During the Centennial year he
started for Philadelphia, fully ex­
pecting and iutending to return after
spending a few weeks at the exposi­
tion. He took wish him only enough
funds to pay the expenses of au econ4
omical trip, for he was never a spend­
thrift, but rather frugal and modest
iu his wants. Weeks went by, and
finally they lapsed into months, still
no tidings (ame fi om Boger?. His
sisters, with whom he lived, waited
patiently aud anxiously for his re­
turn. Finally they wrote to Phila­
delphia and asked the authorities to
find their missing brother.
No man answering his description
could be found; in fact, no trace of
him was discovered and the family
continued to hopo that he was -still
alive. Still no message came from
him, although they could see no rea­
son why he shonld remain away, and
still less why, if alive, he shonld be
silent. Year after year passed, but
from time to time the family con­
tinued the search for the missing rela­
tive. Once during the first inaugura­
of President Cleveland some Buffalo
people reported to Rogers' sisters that
they had seou him in this city. Again
their hope was revived and efforts
were made to follow up the trail, but
all to no purpose. The police in large
cities were asked time and again to
look ont for him.
In his wanderings Rogers frequent­
ly came i?to Washington, and, in
fact, he has been in almost every town
of auy considerable size in both Mary­
land and Virginia. Upon ono of these
trips he went to tho office of Mr. Gitt
to have him intercede for him in ob­
taining a pension. The attorney,
however, had no knowledge of his
client's wanderings. lu this city
Rogers also met Captain Wooley of
the r ostofhec department, who was
the commander of ono of the com­
panies in Rogers' regiment during the
war. He, too, was iu ignorance of
the fact that the former soldier was a
wanderer from home and that his fam­
ily w:is endeavoring to find him.
After laying his case before Mr.
Gitt, Rogers again disappeared, and
evett his a toruey did not know his
whereabouts for a long time. One day,
however, he learned that one of ihe
B?llalo congressmen had received a
request from Rogers' sisters, asking
him to make inquiries concerning
their bio her, whom they* had or.ee
more learned had been seen.
Mr. Gitt assured the cong essman
that lt? go s was still alive an he hud
made strenuous efforts to ! d him. ?
For a lo ig time he was unsuccessful.
Finally, he again found his client's
trail a:i.l followed it to Danville, Va.
There Rogers was discovered about a
week ago and induced to couve to
Washington to meet his sisters, who
were advised ot' the success of the
attorney's r ea ch, and hastened to this
city to see their long-lost relative.
Why Rogers never returned to his
home and ucver wrote io his friends
he is unable to explain, ne is a bright
but somewhat eccentric old man, ami­
able but aimless. He tells many in­
teresting stories of his travels and
his experience with people and affairs.
For twenty-three years he has worked
in one pince or another, both in cities
and in the country, although r. large
portion of the time he has traveled
with the circus. For several seasons
he was with Barnum ? Bailey, then
with Adam Forepaugh, and again with
two or three other traveling shows,
nd thus wandered up and down the
country, through many states and
hundreds of towns.
A phase of his carelessness is illus­
trated by a fact connected with his
arrest while upon one of his periodical
visits to this city. He was taken into
custody aa a vagrant merely because
he stood upon the street thought­
lessly gazing at one of the public
braidings, and because he told a po­
liceman in answer to his queries, that
he had no home and wasn't going any­
where in particular.
When searched at the police-station
lt large amount of money WAS found
in his pockets. Notwithstanding, he
was sent to the workhouse, from
which place he was released through
the efforts of Mr. Gitt. Still Rogers
never returned to the police depart­
ment to ask for his money, and it re­
mains in the hands of the authorities.
Rogers has now made up his mind
?o return to Buffalo and secure pos­
session of the money and estate which
naH long been held for him by his sis­
-, The interest upon the several

thousand dollars which he had in the
Erie County savings bank has caused
the amount to his credit in that insti­
tution to double duriug his absence.
His mortgages have been renewed by
his sisters and his property held in- .
tact, so that he will havo a comforta- !
ble fortune, tho income of which would |
support him in luxury for the remain­
der of his years. He expresses his
desire, however, wheu all of his
financial matters have beeu settlol
up, to como back to Washington and
t ike np his residence in ibis city.­
