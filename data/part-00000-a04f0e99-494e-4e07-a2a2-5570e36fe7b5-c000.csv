FORMER PRESIDENTS ON THE TARIFF.
While the Enquirer is engaged in the task of
presenting the tariff as an unheard of enormity f
I it may not be amiss to refresh the memory of our
' readers by a few short extracts from the messages
of former Presidents, to whom that paper succes­
! sively professed the most unlimited devotion.
First of all comes the Father of his country.
In his message of 8th July, 1790, he uses the
following language:
1 "" The safety and interest of the people require
? that they shall promote sueh manufactories as
tend to render then independent for essentials,""
I fee.
The Enquirer may plead nonage to that; so
we give him next an extract fropi the message
of Mr. Jefferson, dated December, 1802:
"" To cultivate peace and maintain commerce
I and navigation, in all their lawful enterprises;
' to favor our fisheries as nurseries of navigation;
and to protect the manufactories adopted to
our circumstances.""
Again:
"" When a nation imposes high duties on our
Eroductions, or prohibits them altogether, it may
e proper for us to do the same by theirs; first
burdening or excluding their productions, which
they bring here in competition with our own of
the same kind.""
Mr. Madison was (literally) the father of our
I Constitution. In his message of May, 1809, he
recommends to Congress:
""To make such further alterations in the laws
as will more especially protect and foster the
several brandies of manufacture.""
Six years afier, viz. 1815, he goes still further
into the subject. Heat him !
"" There is no subject which can enter with
greater force into the deliberations of Congress
than a consideration of the means to preserve and
promote manufactures, which have sprung into
existence and attained an unparalleled maturity
throughout the United States during the period
of the European wars; this source of nati(^al
independence and wealth, I anxiously recommend,
I therefore, to the prompt and constant guardian­
ship of Congress.""
Mr. Monroe, another Virginia President, in his
Inaugural Address, held the following language:
"" Our manufactures will likewise require the
I systematic and fostering care of government?
possessing, as we do, all the raw materials, the
I fruit of our own will and inJustry, we ought not
to depend, in the degree we have done, on the
supplies from other countries,"" tcc.
In allusion to the same subject, he afterwards
says:
"" It is important too that the capital which
nourishes our manufactures should he domestic,
and its influence, in that case, instead of exhaust­
ing, as it may do in foreign lands, would be felt
advantageously on agriculture aud every other
branch of industry; equally important is it to
provide a home market fur our raw materials,
as by extending the competition it will enhance
the price and protect the cultivator against the
casualties incident to foreign markets.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016317/1844-01-03/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,dlc_firedrake_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Whig standard.,John T.

I>e«th of John II. IMeasnnts* l>q.
We announce this morning, with a sorrow
whicb we have scarcely word* to express, with ai
anguish in which this whole community, and tin
people of this entire Commonwealth will share, ih
d.alh, the untimely death, of JOHN HAMP­
DKN PLEASANTS, Ksq , late Senior Editoi
of this paper. About two o’clock on yesterday
morning, in perfect calmness and resignation, h.
yielded up his spirit to his God.
Upon the melancholy circumstances which
have led to this hi*rt rending result, we need not
say a word. They are lain.liar to every mind.
They require no comment. So sudden, so ap­
palling has been the stroke, that we can even
now scarcely realize the dreadful truth. We are
in a mnasure stupitied ; we know not how to • re­
lievo it possible. Vet, alas! it is too true ! Tin
hand which has so often rented upon the tuhh
where we sit. and wielded a mighty power over the
public mind; which, in ‘thoughts that breathed' and
‘words mat burned,' has enchained thousands < t
admiring hearts, is now cold and motionless ! A
gifted son of genius has been stricken down in the
mid heaven of his career. John Hampden Plea­
sants is no more !

James Pleasants, a Conner Governor of Virginia,
and U. S. Senator from this State. In the spring
rf 1S04, he established the Richmond W hig, ami
devoted to it ten years of the most unwearied labor,
liefore it yiel ted him even a living compensation.
Since that period, the paper became the organ of
the Whig party, end made its way to popular favor
and a reasonable patronage. A more powerful anriE
brilliant pen than that of Mr. P., has never been
enlisted in the editorial ranks of this country. A
more sincere advocate of the great cause to which
his efforts were devoted, never breathed the breath
of li e. A more true, gallant and generous spirit
never dwelt in a human breast. Honest, straight­
forward, full of impulse, he looked at the right,
and never counted consrqueuces; he trampled
under foot with noble scorn all sordid considera­
tions of self, and mtde the press which he con­
ducted a. bright and perfect mirror of his manly
Mr. Pleasants would have been 49 years of age,
some time in March. He has left an aged mother,
two children, several sisters, two brothers, and a
large circle of devo'ed relative* and friends, to la
meat his loss. Our deepest sympathies are with his
bereaved household ; with the helpless orphans,
ao early cast, without a protector, upon a bleak
and cheerless world ; with tho grey-haired
mother, from whose tremhling hands has been
torn the statT, with which she sustained her foot­
steps down the vale of years, and from whi sj lips
the agonizing cry is forced : “ My son ! my son !
would to God that I had died for thee!”—with all
whose hearts are bleeding under this dire calami­
ty, wc most sincerely mourn. But it is idle to
whisper now a word of condolence to th<* b*
rcaved. No human lips can alleviate th'dr un­
speakable sorrow. The halm for grief like their*,
can be administered aloue by a ldivine Physician,
and to Him, in humble reverence and adoring
faith, we know they will lo k for light in their
di kness, and hope in their despair.
St-.et the above was written, a friend ban handed the
fol owing, and we need not aay iijw cordially we concur
with the appeal:
Some of the friends of Mr. Pieasania, feeling acutely
for the . in oli'in and destitution of hi t family, under their
sudden and deplorable bereavement, and cnnaurring it
their duty, as Christians, and aj men, io remember ih- m
in their distress, and provide for them an efTtient relief,
ao far a* ii a in human power, have, for that purpose, set
on foots subscription, which has already been extensive
ly filled.
Jvocatr could weil be imigmed. appealing more strong­
ly to the public sympathy, and aurely no worthier ohjecti.
Ji would be indelicate to enquire into the particular?
of ilirir conduct. It is enough, that two children of t-n.
der years, but of ihe brighte*'promise, and worthy of their
parentage, end a widowed mother, not less venerable for
her virtues, than her years, hive been deprived of then

vain, to the liberality of the people of Richmond, amongst
whom they have been ao long known, and ao greatly io­

There was therefore a second.

“Shall the main question be now put?”
Mr. C. J. Ingersoll, before he voted, desired
the mover of the resolution to give him some in­

somewhat at a Iok® to know its precise meaning.
What did the gentleman mean by the term “go­

The main question was ordered.
Mr. Wentworth called for the yeas and nays

question, so that the vote should be taken sepa­

on the 19th day of February lust, and icm nut
ica ranted by the letter of instructions of the G^nerul-in-chief
to G *n. Worth.
The court, as required, further declares Its opinion
t tat the ""circular published by Brevet Maj. Gen.
Worth to his Division, dated Pueblu, June 16, 1847,
was highly imtrroner and extremely objectionable in

ninny reaped8, especially, us it might tend by exasperating
the whole Mexican nation, to thwart the
well known pacific policy of the United States, and
in view of the high source from which it emanated,
to disturb the friendly relations of our Government
.vith Spain, or, ut least, give occasion to that power,
:o call for explanations or apologies. The barbarous
offence. ugainst which the circular warned the soldiers
ol the First Division, if it existed at uil, equally
ifi'ectod the whole urntv. The information obtained
y General Worth, if worthy of notice, should
therefore have beon communicated to the Generaln-chief,
that lie might have exercised his discretion
11 the means to be adopted for correcting the evil.
With these views of the circular alluded to, the
court is of opinion that it called for the emphatic admonition
and rebuke of the General-in-chief.
In conclusion, this court deems it mnterini to the
case, to express the opinion, that it is the right and
the duty of the General-in-chief, and indispensable
to the preservation of proper discipline in tnearmy,
that he should ut all times possess the privilege of
freely commenting 'upon, disapproving, or censuring
the official acts of his subordinate officers.""","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014405/1847-12-31/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,dlc_dragon_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The daily national Whig.,C.W.

ENGLAND—-Lord John Russell has again
brought forward a Government proposition for
1 he modification of i he Navigation Laws, and
Mr. Bancroft, the United States Minister, states
to w hatever extent in liberality the British Par­
liament may be disposed to legislate in this
matter, that he is ready and willing to sign a
convention immediately, based upon the most
complete reciprocity, and upon the opening of
the entire coasting trade of the two countries
to the vessels of both nations. By the propos­
ed law, it will he competent for an American
vessel to come to Liverpool from the United
States ladened with cotton and tobacco—she
will be permitted to discharge all or part of her
cargo in the Mersey, take in Manchester goods
or coal and passengers, and carry them to Glas­
gow or London in transit, and clear out with
perhaps a fresh cargo from the final port ol her
discharge.

been believed that the subject to which they
relate had been disposed of; for it was noto­
rious that the territorial government bills
were in process of enactment, and in fact
they only failed after midnight on the last
night of the session, and that on this dis­
agreement between the two houses; and
their failure on the 3d of March, was not
known at Jefferson on the 7th?the day of
passing the resolutions, [t was too late to
pass the resolutions for the purpose of in­
structing me how to vote at Washington.
It was too I: te for that; but was early
enough for the summer campaign at home ;
anil, therefore, they were passed ! and now
I 1 have them. 1 mean the plotters ; and be­
tween them and me, henceforth and forever
1 a high wall and a deep ditch ! and no com­
| munion, no compromise, no caucus with
| them. Nor does it require any boldness,
j on my part, to give them defiance. There
are only about a dozen of them?a baker's
(dozen, perhaps?and half of them outside ol
the Legislature. W oe to judges, if any
such there arc in this work ! The children
of Isiael could not stand the government ol
judges; nor can we. * * ?
( itizens! I have finished the view which
I proposed to take of the subject which has
induced my appeal to the people : but there
are othe1- matters upon which my constituents
desire to hear from me, and in which it is
l ight they should be gratified.
""Barnburner."" And what did I go to
New York for last summer, but to use my
utmost exertions to prevent Mr. Van Bu­
ren and his friends from engaging in the
Buffalo convention? I went there, that is
certain. My public speeches show that I
went for that object, and the newspapers in
? lie interest of those called Barnburners, all
assailed me for doing so, not with billings­
gate, and as blackguards, but with keen re­
pioaches lor coming out of my State, con­
trary to the practice of my life, to interfere
in the polities of another State, and that
against those who had always been my
friends. My answer was, thai I came to
use the privilege of an old friend?to give
my opinion that the separate organization
contemplated was wrong in principle, and
would he injurious to those engaged in it ?
and, what was more, injurious to the great'
party to which they belonged. Such was
the object of my visit to New York, and
such my reception. The event disappointed
my hopes and expectations; and I had
my trouble for my pains, and a good deal of
newspaper condemnation into the bargain.
All this was public and notorious, published
in a:l the newspapers, and known to every
body. There i.s not a man in Missouri that
does not know it. And now, what are we
to think of the language applied to me f
Why, that it is a most excellent thing for
me. It shows the character of the plotters,
and that they will nullify and falsify public,
recorded history to villifvme

""The Wilmot proviso."" Well! I think
it is the Jetferson proviso?the Bame that
Mr. Jetferson drew up for the north-we?tern
territory iu 1784?which wan adopted in the
Congress of the confederation of 1787, with
the unanimous voice of the slaveholding
States?was ratified by the Virginia Gene­
ral Assembly the 30th of December, 1788?
which was apprised by the Congress of 18ii0
to all the upper half of Louisiana?which
was applied oy the Congress o( 1848 to the
Oregon Territory?which was recommend­
ed for the new Territories by the Missouri
General Assembly, February loth, 1847
and never attempted to be condemned
until the 19th of February, 1847?just
four days alter the date of the Mis­
souri recommendations?when Mr. Calhoun
brought in hi* resolutions declaring it uncon­
stitutional, insulting to the States, and sub­
versivetothe Union. 1 think Air. Jetferson,
and not Davy Wilmot, was the author ol
this proviso, and that it should bear his name
and not Davy's. With respect to the char­
acter of the proviso, if it should be prescribed
by Congress for any new Territory, 1 think
it will remain just what it has been for sixty
years?a constitutional provision, made in
pursuance to the constitution; and that, being
so made it is binding upon all law-abiding
citizen.!, and that its resistance by force and
arms, militarily, would be treason against
the United States, and punishable by death
under the laws of the land. With respect
to the expediency of the act, there is no ne­
cessity for it, and there are prudential rea­
sons why itshould not be passed. California
and New Mexico are now free from slavery
both by law and by fact; and will forever
remain free from it, both by law and in fact.
As a general proposit.on unnecessary laws
ought not to be passed; but if it is passed, it
is an empty provision, having no practical
effect whatever. To make an issue against
it between north and south, is unwise, for it
is an issue about nothing, and on the part of
the south an issue made for defeat, for
Delaware has instructed for it; and that en­
sures a majority in the Senate for the proviso,
there being already a large majority in the
House of Representatives instructed for it.
But there is a stronger reason to cluim
forbearance. This proviso is the last card
in Calhoun's hand! his last stake in the
slippery game which he has been playing.
Take that last card from him, and his game
is up:?bankruptcy comes upon him?politi­
cal bankruptcy?and he must driven to take
the act. }le will have to haul down his
gign?dose his doors?and shut up shop?
and give in a schedule of his effects and stock
i& trade: and a beautiful schedule it will be.
Let us see some items of it, a few, by way
of sample.

express to you the sincere satisfaction with which
we shall welcome the arrival of another Envoy
Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary from
a sister republic, to which we have so long been,
and still remain, bound by the strongest ties of
amity.
Shortly after I had entered upon the discharge
of the Executive duties, I was apprized that a war­
steamer, belonging to the German Empire, was
being fitted out in the harbor of New York, with
the aid of some of our naval officers, rendered un­
der the permission of the late Secretary of the Na-
vy. lilts permission was grantea aurmg an ar-
mistice between that Empire and the Kingdom of
Denmark, which had been engaged in the Schles
wig Holstein war. Apprehensive that this act of
intervention, on our part, might be viewed as a
violation of our neutral obligationsj incurred by the
treaty with Denmark, and of the provisions of the
act of Congress of the 20th April, 1818, I direc­
ted that no further aid should be rendered by any
agent or officer of the Navy ; and I instructed the
Secretary of State to apprize the Minister of the
German Empire accredited to this Government,
of my determination to execute the law of the Uni­
ted States, and to maintain the faith of treaties
with all nations.
The correspondence, which ensued between the
Department of State and the Minister of the Ger­
man Empire, is herewith laid before you. The
execution of the law and the observance of the
treaty were deemed by me to be due to the honor
of the country, -as well as to the sacred obligations
of the Constitution. I shall not fail to pursue the
same course, should a similar case arise with any
other nations. Having avowed the opinion, on
taking the oath of office, that, in disputes between
conflicting foreign governments, it is our interest,
not less than our duty, to remain strictly neutral,
I shall not abnndon it. You will perceive, from
the correspondence submitted to you, in conexion
with this subject, that the course adopted in this
case has been properly regarded by the belligerent
powers interested in the matter.
Although a Minister of the United States to the
German Empire was appointed by my predecessor,
in August, 1848, and has, for a long time, been in
attendance at F,rankfort-on-the-Maine ; and al­
though a Minister, appointed to represent that Em­
pire, was received and accredited here, yet no
such Government as that of the German Empire
has been definitively constituted. Mr. Donelson,
our representative at Frankfort, remained there
several months, in the expectation that a union of
the German States, under one constitution or form
of government, might, at length, be organized. It
is believed, by those well acquainted with the ex­
isting relations between Prussia and the State? of
Germany, that no such union can be, permanently,
established without her co-operation. In the event
of the formation of such a union, and the organi­
zation of a central power in Germany, of which
she should form a part, it would become necessary
to withdraw our Minister at Berlin ; but while
Prussia exists as an independent kingdom, and
diplomatic relations are maintained with her, there
can be no necessity for the continuance of the
mission to Frankfort. I have, therefore, recalled
Mr. Donelson, and directed the archives of the
legation, at Frankfort, to be transferred to the
American legation at Berlin.
Having been apprized that a considerable num­
ber of adventurers were engaged in fitting out a
military expedition, within the United Stales,
against a foreign country; and believing, from the
best information 1 could obtain, that it was des­
tined to invade the island of Cuba, I deemed it
due to the friendly relations existing between the
United States and Spain; to the treaty between
the two nations; to the laws of the United States,
and, above all, to the American honor, to exert
the jawful authority of this Government in sup­
pressing the expedition and preventing the inva­
sion. To this end, J issued a proclamation, en­
joining it upon the officers of the United States
civil and military, to use all lawful means within
their .power. A copy of that proclamaton is here­
with sumbitted. The expedition has been sup­
pressed. So long as the act of Congress of the
20th of April, 1618, which owes its existence to
the law of nations and to the policy of Washing­
ton himself, shall remain on our statute book, I
bold it to be the duty of the Executive faithfully
to obey its injunctions.
While this expedition was in progress, I was
informed that a foreigner, who claimed our pro­
tection, had been clandestinely, and. as was sup­
posed, .forcibly carried off in a vessel from New
Orleans rto the island of Cuba. I immediately
caused such steps to be taken as 1 thought neces­
Eary, in case the information I had received
rhouhl pmrc correct, to vindicate the honor of

the country r andlthe riglit of every person seeking
an, asylum on our .soilfto the p.rbtectionjfof out I
laws.; The' person ajleged to have been abduct-:
ed, was promptly restored, and the'circqmstan-:-ces
of the case are nowiibout to undergo investi­
gation before a judicial tribunal. I would res­
pectfully suggest, that although the crime charged
to have been committed in this case, is held odi­
ous as being in conflict with our opinions on the
subject of national sovereignty and personal free­
dom, there is no prohibition of it, or punishment
for it, provided in any act of Congress. The ex­
pediency of supplying this defect in our criminal
code is therefore recommended to your considera­
tion.I have scrupulously avoided any interference
in the wars and contentions which have: recently
distracted Europe.
During the late conflict between Austria and
Hungary, there seemed to be a prospect that the
latter might become an independent nation.
However faint that prospect at the time appeared,
I thought it my duty, in accordance with the gen­
eral sentiment of the American people, who deep­
ly sympathized with the Magyar patriots, to stand

prepared, upon the contingency or the establish­
ment by her of a permanent government, to be he
first to welcome independent Hungary into the
family of nations. For this purpose, I invested
an agent, then in Europe, with power to declare
our willingness promptly to recognise her inde­
pendence, in the event of her ability to sustain it.
The powerful intervention of Russia, in the con­
test, extinguished the hopes of the struggling
Magyars. Ihe United States did not, at any
time, interfere in the contest; but the feelings of
the nation were strongly enlisted in the cause,
and by the sufferings of a brave people, who had
made a gallant though unsuccessful effort to be
free.
Our claims upon Portugal have been, during
the past year, prosecuted with lenewed vigor; and
it has been my object to employ every effort of
honorable diplomacy to procure their adjustment.
Our late Charge d'Aftairs at Lisbon, the Hon.
George W. Hopkins, made able and energetic,
but unsuccessful efforts to settle these unpleasant
matters of controversy, and to obtain indemnity
for the wrongs which were the subjects of com­
plaint. Our present Charge d'Affairs at that
court will, also, bring to the prosecution of these
claims ability and zeal. The revolutionary and
distracted condition of Portugal, in past times,
has been represented as one of the leading causes
of her delay in indemnifying our suffering citi­
zens. But I must now say, it is matter of pro­
found regret that these claims have not yet been
settled. The omission of Portugal to do justice
to the American claiments has now assumed, a
character so grave and serious, that I shall short­
ly make it the subject of a special message to
Congress, with a view to such ultimate action as
its wisdom and patriotism may suggest.
With Russia, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, Den­
mark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Italian
States, we still maintain our accustomed amica­
ble relations.
During the rece'nt revolutions in the Papal
States, our Charge d' Affairs at Rome has been
unable to present his letter of credence, which,
indeed, he was directed by my predecessor to
withhold until he should receive further orders.
Such was the unsettled condition of things in
those States, that it was not deemed expedient to
give him any instructions on the subject of pre­
senting his credential letter different from those
with which he had been furnished by the iate ad
ministration, until the 25th of June last; when, in
consequnence of the want of accurate information

lion in presenting himself to the then existing
government, if, in his judgment, sufficiently sta­
ble; or if not, to await further events. Since that
period, Rome has undergone another revolution,
and he abides the establishment of a government
sufficiently permanent to justify him in opening
diplomatic intercourse with it.
With the republic of Mexico, it is our true pol­
icy to cultivate the most friendly relations. Since
the ratification of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidal­
go, nothing has occurred of a serious character to
disturb them. A faithful observance of the trea­
ty, and a sincere respect for her rights, cannot fail
to secure the lasting confidence and friendship of
that republic. The message of my predecessor
to the House of Representatives, of the 8th of Feb­
ruary last, communicating, in compliance with a
resolution of that body, a copy of a paper called
a protocol, signed at Queretaro on the 30th of May,
1848, by the commissioners of the United States
and the minister of foreign affairs of the Mexican
government, having been a subject of correspon­
dence between the Department of State and the
Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentia­
ry of that republic accredited to this government,
a transcript of that correspondence is herewith
submitted.
The Commissioners on the part of the Uni­
ted States for marking the boundary between
the two republics, though delayed in reaching
San Diego by unforseen obstacles, arrived at
that place within a short periud after the time
required by the treaty, and was there joined by
the commissioner on the part of Mexico. They
entered upon their duties ; and, at the date of
the latest intelligence from that quarter, some
progrebs had been made in the survey. The

Mr. CALHOUN. Mr. President, I rise to correct what
I conceive to be the error of tbe distinguished senator
from Massachusetts, as to the motives which induced the
admission of Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. I have
heard with regret the statement that it was the desire of
the southern people to get an extension of territory with
the view of cultivating cotton with more success than
they would in a crowded settlement. Now, 1 think the
history of this acquisition will not sustain such a view.
It is well know that the acquisition of Florida was the
result ot an Indian war. The Seminole Indians crossed
over land and took one of our fortresses. The troops were
ordered out, but were driven back. Then, under the com­
mand of Gen. Jackson, Pensacola was seized. It was ihese
acts, and not the desire for more territory, that caused the
acquisition of Florida. I admit, however, that it had
been for a long time the desire, on the part of the South,
and of the administration, I believe, to acquire Florida;
but it was very different from the reason assigned by the
senator. There were collected together in that Territory
four tribes of Indians?the Creek, the Choctaw, the
Chickasaw, and the Cherokee?about 30,000 warriors,
who held connexion, almost the whole of them, with
the Spanish authorities in Florida, and had their trade
principally with them. It was well known that a most
pernicious influence was at work there; and it waa in
the desire of preventing any conflict between these In­
dians, and ourselves, and Spain, that may be found the
motive which induced the desire to acquire Florida.
I come now to Louisiana. You well know tliat the
immediate cause of that acquisition wus the suspension
of our right Of deposite at New Orleans. Under the
treaty with Spain, we bad the right of navigation of the
river as far as New Orleans, and to make depositee there
The Spanish authorities interrupted that right. This
brought on great agitation in tbe West, and, (maintain,
throughout the whole of the United Slates. Some gen­
tlemen then, in opposition to a highly respectable party,
if I mistake not, took the lead in the desire of resorting
to arms to acquire that Territory. Mr. Jefferson, more
prudent, desired it should coine in by purchase. The
purchase was made to remove that difficulty, and to give
to the West an outlet to the ocean. That was the im­
mediate cause of the admission of Louisiana.
Now, sir, I come to Texas. Perhaps no gentleman
had more to do with the acquisition of Texas than my­
self; and I aver that I would have been among the very
last individuals in the United States to have made any
movement at that time towards the acquisition of Texas ;
and I go further and say, if 1 know myself, 1 was inca­
pable of acquiring any territory simply on tbe ground
that it was to be slave territory. No, sir; a very differ­
ent motive actuated ine. I knew at a very early period
that tbe British government had given encouragement to
the abolitionists who were represented in the World's
Convention. The question of abolition was agitated in
that convention; and one gentleman stated that Mr.
Adams informed him that, if the British government
chose to abolish slavery in the United States, they inu?t
commence at Texas. A committee from this World's
Conventon was seut to the Secretary of State. It so hap­
pened that this very gentleman was present when the in­
tercourse took place between Lord Aberdeen and that
committee, and he gave him a full account of'it shortly
after that occurrence, stating that Lord Aberdeen fell into
the project to give encouraxeiuent to the abolitianists. It
ia well known tliat Lord Aberdeen was a very correct
and, in my opinion, a very honest inan. Mr. Packen­
ham was sent here to negotiate relative to Oregon and in­
cidentally about Texaa. He was ordered to read hia dec­
laration to this government, stating that the British gov­
ernment was negotiating relative to putting an end to
slavery all over the world, aud in Texaa especially. It
was well known further that, at that veiy time, Prance
and England had negotiated with America to effect th it
purpose, and our government was thrown out by a?[Tbe
remainder of the sentence waa inaudible to the Reporter.]
The object of that was to indace Mexico to recogniae the
independence of Texaa upon the ground that ahe had abol -
1 shed slavery. Now all these are matters of fact.

often enough to bathe the whole body, for
the purpose of luxury or cleanliness,"" and
beyond this Ih^t bathing is injurious.—
Those w ho have never adopted the prac­
tise of frequent bathing, will probably re­
ceive this opinion ol the Journal as '""law
and gospel,"" but those who have, knows
it to be humbug. Willi all due deference
to the opinion ol the Bosldi Medical an.l
Surgical Journal, and lo its reputation for
reliableness, we cannot shut our eyes to
tbe fact tl'at its editor is absent, and that
its teachings on this point, at present, are
calculated to do injury. But we give ihe
Journal's rationale:—

The oil which is secreted by the se­
baceous glands of the skin, serves the
purpose ol lubricating its surface. Now
if this secretion is constantly removed as
fast as exuded, it* destined object is there­
by defeated. The excretory ducts of Ihe
perspiratory glands, and the glands them­
selves, require this unctuous matter ol the
skin to keep them in healthy action. If
very frequent bathing of the whole botly
is practiced, it must be obvious that this
matter cannot be long present to perform
its office. As to tbe assimilation of func­
tions of the skin and lung*, it will be ap­
parent, that when the skin act* imperfect­
ly or ceases to act «t all, the lungs have an
extra amount of duty to perform and it is
generality in just such cases thai engorge­
ment of them take* place,-constituting in­

The dates from San Francisco ore to March

by the Legislature to elect a United .States Sen­
ator in place of Col. Fremont have proved in­
effectual. When the Convention first met, the
prominent Whig candidates were IIou. T. Butler
King and Hon. John Wethered, and the Demo­
cratic candidates were Col. Fremont and Mr
Heydenifclt Mr. Wethered finally abandoned
the contest, and it won narrowed down to the
three others named.
After nearly one hundred and fifty ballotings
the convention, finding it impossible to make a
choice, adjourned till the 1st of January next.
King had the highest vote on the last ballot,
but lacked six or eight votes of an election.
Heydenfelt was the favorite of the Democrats,
r rem out, who commenced with only a half­
dozen names, gradually increased in strength,
until, before the convention adjourned, his vote
equalled that of Heydenfelt, On the last day
the latter withdrew, and Colonel Weller was
substituted Lu his place, who received exact 1 y
the vote before given to the withdrawing candi­
date. A good deal of feeling exists on the
subject, and the senatorial question will enter
largely into the next political canvass.
On Sunday, 23d of February, San Francisco
was in a tremendous state of exoitement on
account of the anticipated execution by the pop­
ulace of two noted scoundrels* Stewart and
Windred, for nearly murdering Mr. Hanson, a
respectable merchant of this place, and robbing
[ him of $2,000. A meeting of citizens wan called
| several of our most influential and wealthy men
I presided, and the prisoners were given u fair
trial by jury. The jury, however, disagreed,
and the officer of justice took possession of the
culprits. At Sacramento City a similar affair
occurred, but the offender did not escape so
easily. Frederick Roe, a noted gambler, shot
through the head a Mr. Charles Myers for in­
terfering to put an end to a quarrel in which he
was engaged. A meeting of the citizens was
called, in which the most prominent and influ­
ential men took part; Roe was tried, convicted,
and in less than five hours after the commission
of the crime he was hung in the presence of
an assemblage of thousands.
Business Was still dull, and the arrivals at
San Francisco of foreign shipping had greatly
fallen off within the last fortnight. The miners
were doing very well throughout the State, and
j an increased amount of gold was expected to be
taken out during the coming season. There
lias been but little rain in San Francisco, though
the interior has been more favored in this
respect
A terrible accident occurred by which the
steamboat Santa Clara was completely destroyed
by fire, and the steamboat Hartford damaged
to the extent of $80,000. The Santa Clara
took fire first, and was bumed to the water's
edge. Three of the crew were burned to death,
and Mr. Kennedy, one of the owners, narrowly
escaped, after being severely burnt. The Hart­
ford caught from the Santa Clam.

How to Eraw Hie Sinners.
Several years ago we were a resident of
north western Louisiana, near tie con
fines of Texas. The p?ople there, as a
general thing, were not much given to
Godliness, and cared about as little for
theif!8Quls as they did for their bodies,
beins unconcerned as to the safetv of ei­
ther. A young itinerant preacher hap­
pened along in the neighborhood during
this dearth of religion, and set about re­
paring the walls of Zion in good earnest.
But his sucess wa poor. Not over half
a dozen persons could be got together at
his Sunday meeting, and he began to
think the Lord was frowning upon Iiis
earnest and heart-felt endeavors to s ve
the people. Determined however, to
create ar interest btfore leaving the
neighborhood, he procured some printed
hand-bills and had them posted up in ev­
ery conspicuous place in tht district,
which Tead to the following effect:
Religious Notice. The Rev. Mr.
Blaney, will preach next Sunday in
Dempsy's Grove, at ten o'clock, A. M.,
and at four o'clock P. M., Providence
permitting. Between the services, the
preacher will run his sorrel mare Julia,
against any nag that can be trotted out
in that region, for a purse of five hundred
dollars.
This had the desired effect. Teople
flocked from all quarters, and the anxie­
ty to see the singular preacher, was even
greater than th excitement following
his challenge, He preached an elegant
sermon in the morning, and after dinner
he brought his mare for the race. The
purse was made up by five or six of the
planters, and an opposing nag produced.
The preacher rode his little sorrel and
won Ihe clay, amid deafning shouts,
screams and yells of the delighted peo­
ple. The congregation all remained to
the afternoon service, and at its close
more than two hundred joined the church
some from motives of sincerity, some
for the novelty of the thing, some from
excitement, and some because thep-cach-er
in the unrefined language of the
country was a d d good fellow!'
The finale of the affair, was. as nourishing
a society as can be found in the whole
region thereabouts.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87056240/1851-07-02/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,in_fairmount_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Plymouth pilot.,John Q.

THevr Use of Ice.
V-;Th acientifie men of France are, at pres­
tnV speculating on a recent instance of a
YDunr man bein' brought to life after beinff
n-oicn ud eleven months on the Alps. It
hat given rise to a revived belief in the the­
ory, that life can be suspended at pleasure,
and criminals are about to be demanded of the
Oovernment, to be frozen on experiment.
The reader will already have inferred what a
relief this oilers such unhappy ladies, as tind
themselves not contemporary with the hearts
they igh to win. They have only to be
iced tilt overtaken! We should add that the
above i by no means a joke, however. The
. blood pi a living man was infused into the
feins of the frozen youth, and he moved and
""poke. The experiment was afterwards tried
on a hare froien for the purpose, with com­
plete success. . ; ,

An article recently published in the Tmth Ltgitn,
of Virginia, says that In oonaequenoe of the agitation
on the subject of slavery, ia the last General Assem­
bly of the New School Presbyterian Church, which
met at Buflfclo, a number of the ministers of that per­
suasion, in the Synod of Virginia, have signed the
following resolutions, and proposed them to the
other Southern Synods for adoption: ?
Resolved. 1 ?That the Pieabytariee In tha alar* holding
State* decline making any raeponse to tha inquiries pro­
pood by tba lata Oeoaral Assembly.
2.? That laid Preebyteries be fully wpwmtal la tha
Bsxt AimbUj.
3 ?That laid Pmbjtoiln instruct their delegates to
the next Assembly. in tha event of the labjeet of slavery
being introduced, to pro pore resolutions ei preening In tba
stroigeet terms the opinion of the Assembly, that all
further agitation of the subject in that body la moat un­
wiie and improper, and should not be permitted And
fhoulrt tba Assembly refuae to sanction such resolutions,
that the delegates trom said Presbyteries be Inatructed
lin mediately to withdraw and unite with thoae from
otter portiona ef the church, oppeeed to the further agi­
tation of thia aubject in the Aaaembly, either in a new
organization, or ia eueh other measure* as in their judg­
ment will be most expedient.
The same paper sayB that some of the Southern
members of this church are in favor of immediate
scccession, and that, possibly, some will take that
cource, but that the plan indicated in the above
resolutions seems generally preferred.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/1853-07-25/ed-1/seq-8,"","",8,"","",1,dlc_nosebleed_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The New York herald.,James Gordon Bennett,New York [N.Y.],"","",9104,881,2833,3460,8,17778,26256,0,dlc_nosebleed_ver01/data/sn83030313/00271743087/1853072501/0203.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_nosebleed_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn83030313%2F00271743087%2F1853072501%2F0203.jp2/pct:51.209360,3.355424,15.935426,13.177940/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_nosebleed_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn83030313%2F00271743087%2F1853072501%2F0203.jp2/pct:51.209360,3.355424,15.935426,13.177940/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

the note prepared by the four European
Powers, which had been already acceded
to by the Czar. Everything looks quiet

yet attended with sorrowful feelings: fur
alas! in the remains of that gallant army
of patriot soldiers, now about to disband
without pay, without support, stalked
poverty and disease. The country had
not the means to be grateful.
The details of the condition of many
of the officers and sildiersat that period,
according to history and oral tradition,
were melancholy in the extreme. Posses­
sing no means of patrimonial inheritance
to fall back upon?thrown out of even
the perilous support of the soldier, at the
commencement of Winter, and hardly fit
for an}- other duty than that of I he camp
?their situation can be as well imagined
as described.
A single instance, as a sample of the
situation of many of the officers, as related
of Baron Steuben, may not be amiss.?
When the main body of the army was
disbanded at Newburgh, and the veteran
soldiers were bidding a parting farewell
to each other, Lieutenant Col. Cochran,
an aged soldier of the New Hampshire
line, remarked with tears in his eyes, as
he shook hands with the Karon :
"" For myself, I could stand it: but my
wife and ""daughters are in the garret of
that wretched tavern, and I have no
means of removing them.""
"" Come, come,"" said the Baron, ""don't
give way thus. I will pay my respects
to Mrs. Cochran and her daughters.
When ti e good old soldier left them,
their countenances were warm with grati­
tude?for he left there all he had.
In one of the Rhode Island Regiments
were several companies of black troops
who had served through the whole war,
and their bravery and discipline were un­
surpassed. The Baron observed one of
these poor negroes on the wharf at New­
burgh, apparently in great distress.
"" What is the matter, brother soldier ?""
"" Why, master Baron, I want a dollar
to get home with, now that Congress has
no further use forme.""
The Baron was absent for a few mo­
ments, and then returned with a silver
dollar which he had borrowed.
""There, it's all I could get. Take it.""
The negro received it with joy, hailed a
sloop which was passing down the river
to New York, and as he reached the dock,
took off his hat and said?
""God bless you, Master Baron ?""
These are only single illustrations of
the condition of the army at the close of
the war. Indeed, Washington had this
view at the close of his farewell address
to the army at Rock Hill, in November,
1783:
""And being now about to conclude |
these, his last public orders, to take his
ultimate leave in a short time of the mili­
tary character,?and to bid a final adieu
to the armies he has so long had the honor
to command, he can only again offer, in
their behalf, his recommendations to their
country, and his prayer to the God of
armies.""
""May ample justice be done them here,
and may the choicest of heaven's favors, '
both here and hereafter, attend those who, 1
under divine auspices, have secured innu- (
merable blessings for others.""
""With these wishes, and this benedic- j
tion, the Commander-in-Chief is al>out to j
retire from service. The curtain of sepa­
ration will soon be drawn, and the mili­
tary scenes will be closed to him forever.""
The closing of the ""military sccnes"" I
am about to relate.
New York had been occupied by Wash­
ington on the 25th of November. A few
days afterward, he notified the President
of Congress?which body was then in
session at Annapolis, in Maryland?that
as the war had now closed, he should con­
sider it his duty to proceed thence and
surrender to that body the commission
which he had received from them seven
years before.
The morning of the 5th of December,
1783, a sad and heavy one to the remnant
of the American army in the city of New
York. The noon of that day was to wit­
ness the farewell of Washington?he was
to bid adieu to his military comrades for­

ever. The officers who had been with
, him in solemn council, the privates who
had fought and bled in the ""hardy fight ""
j under his orders, were to hear his com­
mands no longer. The manly form and
dignified countenance of the -""mat can.
; Uiu'"" henceforth to titfin tZTr
memories.
As the hour of noon approached, the
whole garrison, at the request of Wash­
ington himself, was put in motion, and i
marched down Broad street to Francis's i
tavern, his head quarters. lie wished to
take leave of the private soldiers alike
with the officers, and bid them all adieu,
liis favorite light infantry were drawn
up m the line facing inwards, through
1 earl strict to the foot of Whitehall,
where a barge was in readiness to convey
him to Powle's Ilook. * ;
W ithin the dining-room of the tavern
were gathered the Generals and field
officers to take their farewell.
Assembled there were Knox, Green, i
Clinton, Steuben, Gates, and others, who !
had served with him faithfully and trulv i
m the ""tented field;"" but alas! where
were others that had entered the war
with him seven years before? Their bones
crumbled in the soil from Canada to
Georgia. Montgomery had yielded up
his life at Quebec, Wooster fell at Dan­
bury, A\ oodhull was barbarously mur­
dered while a prisoner at the battle of
Long Island, and Mercer fell mortally
wounded at Princeton; the brave and I
chivalric Laurens, after displaying the
most heroic courage in the tranches at
lorktown, died in a trifling skirmish in
South ( arolina; the brave hut eccentric
Lee was no longer living, and Putnam,
like a helpless child, was stretched upon
the bed of sickness. Indeed, the battle-'
held and time had thinned ihe ranks
which entered with him in the ranks of
Independence.
Washington entered the room?the |
hour of separation had come. Asrhc>'
raised his eye and glanced on the faces
of those assembled, a tear coursed down
his cheek, and his voice was tremulous
as he saluted them. Nor was he alone '
Men, ""albeit unused to the melting mood"" '
stood around him, whose uplifted hands
to cover their brows, told that the tear, ,
which they in vain attempted to conceal, I
bespoke the anguish they could not hide. I
After a moment'Vf conversation, Wash­
ington called for a glass of wine. It was I
brought him. Turning to the officers, he
thus addressed them:
44 With a heart full of love and grati­
tude, 1 now take my final leave of you. i
I most devotedly wish your latter days
may be as prosperous and happy as your
former ones have been glorious ""and hon- '
orable. lie then raised the glass to his
hps, and added ? "" I cannot come to
each of you to take my leave, but shall i
be obliged to 3-011 if each of you will take
me bv the hand.""
. General Knox, who stood nearest, burst
into tears, and advanced, incapable of
utterance. Washington grasped him bv
the hand, and embraced him. The offi­
cers came up successively and took an
aiieciionate leave. No words were spo­
ken, but all was the 44 silent eloquence of
tears."" What were mere words at such '
a scene? Nothing. It was the feeling
of the heart-thrilling though unspoken
\Y hen the last officer had embraced
him, \\ ashingtom left the room, followed j
by Ins comrades, and passed through the
lines of light infantry. His step was
slow and measured, his head uncovered, f
and tears flowing thick and fast, as he
looked from side to side at the veterans '
t<; whom lie now bid adieu for ever. 1
Shortly an event occurred more touching
than all the rest. A gigantic soldier who I
had stood by his side at Trenton, stepped
forth irom the ranks and extended his ,
hand.
'' Farewell, my beloved General, fare- 1
well.'
Washington grasped his hand, in con­
vulsive emotion, in both of his. All dis­
cipline was now at an end. The officers
couid not. restrain the men as they rushed ?
forward to take Washington b}- the hand, ?
and the violent sobs and tears of the
soluiers told how deeply engraven upon
their affections was the'love of their com­
mander.
As length Washington reached the
barge at \\ hitehall, and entered it. At j
the first stroke of the oars he rose, and I
turning to the companions of his glory, j
by waving his hat, bade them a silent !
auieu. Their answer was only in tears:
and the officers and men, with glistening I
eyes, watched the receding boat till the
form of their noble commander was lost :
sight of in the distance.
Contrast the farewell of Washington to
his army at Whitehall, in 1783, and the
farewell of Napoleon at Fontainbleu, in
lSl.?. 1 lie one had accomplished every i
wish of his heart. His noble exertion
had achieved the independence of hisj
country, and he longed to retire to the
bosom of his home. His ambition was
satisfied. He fought for no crown, no
sceptre, but for equality and the mutual
happiness of his fellow beings. No taint
of tyranny, no breath of slander, 110 i
whisper of duplicity, marred the fair pro­
portions of his private or public life;'
but,
?? 1 was a man, take liim !6r all in all,
We !icV-r .t?>k upon his like again.
The other great soldier was the disciple
of selfish ambition. He raised the iron i
weapon of war to crush, only that lie !
might rule. What to him were theories '
of widows and orphans ! He passed to a
throne by making dead lxxlics of their :
protectors his steping stones. Ambition, 1
self, were the gods of his idolatry, and to '
them he sacrificed hecatombs of his fel­
low men for the aggrandizement of personal
glory. Enthusiasm points with fearful
wonder to the name of Napoleon, whilst
justice, benevolence, freedom, and all the I
concomitants which constitute the true
happiness of man, sheds almost a divine |
halo around the name and character of i
George Washington.

Jie a Hungarian "" Mr. Brown. (lie Chaise il Adaiiea
ad inltrtm of the United States at Constantinople, who
was not at Smyrna at any time during tbe transaction in
relation to koszta, stated in a letter to Baton de Biuck
something tjyke the foregoing deolaialmn ; but Captain
Iuglaliam, Who was piesrnt, an Mr. 11 uUeiuann states,
when koszta was examined, and made the dedaiatiun

of tlie United States : ""1 am astonished to are by Mr.
Biown's letter that koszta declared biHii>ell o.i out tlrst
intei view a Hunganau I did not bear bun aav so "" It
may well be doubted whether Ko-/.ta ever used any auch
language Should it, however.be admitted that lie did
make that ot a similar declaration, it cannot be iairly un­
derstood to imply hii acknowledgment thai.he waa then
h subject ol the Emperor of Austria. To apptskend
rightly what he meant by such a declaration, it ? proper
to conauler his situation, bia known sentiments .and his
antecedents In his iiiind no two things could probably
be more distinct from each other than Austria and
Hungary. One waa an object of hie aveisiou?ths
other an object of hi"" love. Him affections cluttered
around the land of hi* birth, anil wera the more in­
tense because he thought that country had been cruelly
wronged, and he knew it waa unfortunate. In Ins
visions of the future ha caw a happier dcatmy for
Hungary. He saw her mantling pioudly among the
independent nations ol the earth, under a element gov­
ernment emanating from the will of the people, and
dedicating its constitutional authority to their general
welfare. In the fallen condition of Hungary he tnoaght
it base to disown her, and glorious to claim her fur
the land of hi? birth. Hi* situation when tbia decla­
ration is supposed to have been made ia also to he re­
garded in interpreting bin wnrda. He was in the hand*
of Austrian agents, loaded with fetters, and warned of
his own dooui by the knowledge of the sad fate of ao
many of his uuhirturute companions In this forlorn
condition he could not have intended, by the language
ascribed to bun, to acknowledge any unbroken tie which
then bound him to the Kniperor of Austria.
The undersigned ia brought, by a fair application of
sound principles of law, and by a careful consideiation
of the facts, to this iui|>ortanl conclusion?that those who
ac'ed in heliulf of Austria had no right whatever to aeize
and imprison Martin koszta.
It will he conceded that the civil authority of Turkey
during the whole penod of the occurrences at Smyrna
was dormant, and in no way called into action. Under
ttiese circumstance*?Austria without any authority?
Turkey exercising none?and the American functionaries,
as Austria asserts, haying no right in behalf of their gov­
ernment to iuterfeie in the alfair, (a proposition which
will be hereafter contested)?what, then, waa the con­
dition of the parties at the commencement of the outrage,
and through its whole progress .' They were all, in this
view ot the case, without the immediate presence and
controlling direction of civil or international law in re­
gard to the treatment of Koszta. The Qreek hirelings,
ko-zta their victim, and the Austrian and American
agents, were, upon tins supposition, all in the same con­
dition at Smyrna in respect to rights ami duties, so
far as regards that transaction, as they would have beta
in il it hud occurred in their presence in some unappro­
priated region lying far beyond the confines of any sov­
ereign Sta'c whatever; they were the liege subjectso/ilia
law ol nature, moral agents, bound each and all alike to
observe the precepts of that law ; and es|tecially that which
is continued by divine sanction, and enjoins upon all men
everywhere, when not acting under legal restraints, to
do unto others whatsoever they would that others should
do unto them ; they were bound to do no wrong, and to
the extent ol their ineaua to prevent wrong from bsing
done; to protect the weak from being oppressed by the
strong, und to relieve the distressed. In tlie case supposed,
koszta waa seized without any rightful authority. He
was suffering grievous wrong?any one that could might
relieve him. To do so was a duty imposed under the j?e­
culiar circumstances of the caaa by the laws of humanity.
Captain fngraham, in doing what he did for the release of
koszta, would, in this view of the case, be fully justified
upon this principle. Who. in such a case, can fairly take
| offence ? Who have a right to complain - Not tbe wrong­

doers ?ur<;ly, for they can appeal to no law to justify
their conduct. They can derive no support from civil
authority, tor there was none called into action; nor
from the Uw of nature, lor that they have violated.
To place the justification of the American agent* still
further beyond controversy, the undersigned will n >w
proceed to show that Kotzta, when he was seized and
imprisoned at Smyrna, had the national character of an
American, and tho government of the United States had
the right to extend its protection over him.
The genuineness of the certificate which be produced
when be claimed protection as an American citizen hat
been questioned, in consequence of the imperfect copy
given t>y Mr. Brown la the Austrian internuncio; but
that winch he produced to the American Consul at Siayr
iia, ami to Captain lngraham, to the commander of tbe
Austiian bun; Huszai, and to the Austrian Consul-Gener­
al, was genuine. A correct copy of it has been sent to
this department, and verified by a comparison with the
record of the court in New York in which Koszta made
his declaration in due form of law To remove all doubt
on ttns subject, a certified copy of that record is annexed
to this communication.
It is not contended that this initiatory step in the pro­
cess of naturalization invested him with all tba civil
rights of an American citizen ; but it is sufficient for nil
the purposes of this case to show that he wai clothed
with an American nationality ; and in virtae thereof, the
government ol the United States was authorized to ex­
tend to him iis protection, at home and abroad. Mr.
Hulsemann, as tbe undersigned believes, fails info s
great error?an error fatal to some ol his most important
conclusions?by assuming that a nation can properly ex­
tend its protection only to native-born or naturalizes em­
zrns Tins is not tf.e dre'rine of international law, nor
is the practice ol nations circum?cribed within such nar­
row limits This law does not, as iiaa been before re­
inaiked, complicate questions of this nature by respect
for municipal codes In relation to Hun subject, it has
clear an I distinct rules of its own. It give* the national
character ol the country not only to native-born aad nat­
uralised citi/ens, hut to all residents 111 it whoare there
with, or even without, an intention to become citizens,
provided they have a domicil therein. Foreigners My,
arid Often do, acquire a domicil in a country, even
though they have entered it with the avowed intention
not to become naturalized citizens, hut to return to their
native land at some remote and uncertain period j and
whenever they acquire a domicil, international law sf
once impresses upon them the national character of tbe
country of tbat doaicil. It is a mux mi of international
law that domicil confers a national character ; it does not
allow any one who has a domicil to decline the national
character thus conferred; it forces it upon bin often
very siuch against his will, and to his great detriaenL
International law looks only to the national character is
dele/mining what country has the right to protect. If a
person goes from tins country abroad, with (be national­
ity of the United S'atcs, this law enjoins upon other na­
tions to respect linn, in regard to protection, as an Amer­
ican citizen. It concedes to every country tbe rifbt to
protect any and all wbo may b? clothed with its national­
ity. These are important principles in their hearings sp­
oil the questions presented in Mr. Hulwmann'a note, and
are too obvious to be contested ; bat a* they are opfiosed
lo some of the poeilioaa taken by Austria, the under­
signed deems it respectful in such a case to soatain the*
by reference to authorities.

"" The position in ? clear one, thai if a person goes into
: a foreign country, and engage* in trade there, be is, by
1 the law of nation*, to be considered a merchant of that
! eoanlry, and a tubitU for all civil pnrjioees, whether
j ttiat country he boetilaor neutral."" (I Kent Com., 78.)

! nations, ?? to Kuro|ie, the rule la, that men take their n?­
' tional chsrscor from the general character of the country
in winch they reside."" (Ibid., 78.)
If Ko^/ta ever had a domic.il in the United Stales, be
wa* in vir'.ue thereof invented with the nationality of
this cdiiniiv. and in this character continued M long a*
that dumicil wg* retained. There mre caeca in wbieb t(
i? difficult to setile the question of domieil; but that of
Kn-zia m n""t one of them.
The motrt approved definitions of a domieil are the
following : "" A residence at a particular place, accom­
jaaied Willi positive or pneumptive proof of conlinainf
there for an unlimited time""?(1 Binne>'e Reports, 34U )
"" If it sufficiently appear that the intention of removing
w*s to make a permanent settlement, or for an indefi­
nite time, tbe right of domieil is scijnired by a residence
of a few day"".""?(The Venn"", 8 Crunch. 27V.) u Vattel
has defined domieil to he a hxrd residence in any place,
wnh an intention of always ?ia>ing there. But tnis >?
riot an ac.cura'e statement It would be more correct to
?ay that that place is properly the domieil of ? person in
which his habitation is fixed, without any preaeoJ inten­
tion of removing therefrom.""?(Siory's Con. of Law?,
? J.'i ) "" A |>er?on who removes to a foreign country.
?eiil?-? him?ell there, and engages in tbe trad?? of the
country, furnishes by these acta such evidence of an in­
tention |iermaneiitly lo reside there as to stamp him with
the nstional character of the State where be resides""
(The Ventia, 8 Cranch, 379.)
Apply those principles to the cane under conaideralion,
and the inevitable result is that Koszta bad a domieil in
the United States, lie came to and resided in tbia coon
try one year and eleven months. He csme here with the
intention of making it his future abode. This intention
was manifested in several ways, hut most significantly by
his solemn declaration upon oath. There can be no bet­
ter evidence of his design of making the United States
his future uome than such a declaration ; and to ibis kind
of evidence ol the intention, the indn|*'iiaable element of
true domic.il, civilians have always attached import­
ance. (I'hillimore, $ ISih ) In the case of Kosita. w?

Where in fiction is there anything more
strange than this fact, lelated in the Musi­
cal World, by R. Storrs Willis ?—'""The fol­
lowing strange incident happened while I
was living in Germany. In the neighbor­
*■ hood of Vienna there dwelt a young peas­
ant woman, who supported herself by the
cultivation of vegetables, which she dispos­
ed of in the Vienna market. She inhabit­
ed a small house, attached to which was
her vegetable garden. Young as she was,
she had been married ‘ but her husband had
<lied. leaving her a little girl, who was now
just old enough to run about and play with
the other children in the neighbourhood.—
The mother was still handsome, and desi-i
rous of a second marriage. About this
time, indeed, there was visiting her a young
man for whom she had conceived an affec­
tion, and whose proposition of marriage she
was now beginning impatiently to await.
H But uo proposal was made. A dark thought
finally crossed the young woman’s mind
that there must he some oh.-tacle in the
way, and that this obstacle was, in all prob­
ability, the child. An unnatural struggle
of jealousy took place, which resulted in a
fearful determination—she would make a­
way with the child! Beneath her house
was a deep cellar, where she occasionally
stored her vegetables. Taking her child by
the hand one day, she led it down stairs,
and,thrusting it inside, closed the door,lock­
ed it, and hurried up stairs. The same e
vening her lover came ; they sat chatting
together, but no mention was made of the
little absentee. The next day, after a de­
sertion of twenty-four hours, the mother
went soltlv down and listened at the door.
The quick ear of the child caught her mo­
ther’s step, and she implored her to take
her out of that dark place—she was so cold
i and very hungry. No answer was return­
ed, and the mother crept quietly up stairs.
In the evening the lover came again.—
They took supper together, and passed a
social evening. After the second twenty­
four hours had passed, the mother made an­
other visit to the child. Again the little
•afferer heard her, and with feeble voice

begged for a crust of bread—only one crust
«f bread. This pulled a little upon the mo­
theFs heart, but—her purpose was fixed.
Another day passed. The mother went
quietly down stairs and listened. All was
•ilent. Slie opened softly the door—the
child lay dead. Taking swiftly the body
up stairs, she laid it upou a bed; and im­
mediately making a great outcry, called the
neighbors together, telling them that her
child had suddenly died. And so it seemed.
The day after there was a funeral. The
child was lying in its coffin bestrewed with
flowers, brought by the little playmates in
the neighbourhood, who had come to attend
the funeral of their lost favourite. The
* procession moved towards the quiet Golles­
acker* (G )d’s acre,) where was to be plant­
ed this little seed of an immortal flower.—
A clergyman was in attendance. The mo­
ther stood looking down upon the grave, I
over which the holy man was repeating,
with solemn voice, ‘Our Father, who art in J
Hea ven, hallowed be thy name; thy king­
dom come ; thy will be done on earth as it
is in heaven. Give us tfas day our daily
bread_•’ A piercing shriek,and the mo­
ther fell with a groan to the earth. Look­
ing wildly around her, she then, in gibber- i
ing accents,related to the shuddering throng
at the grave the very deed her own hands
had committed. She lived not long after.
Crazed and smitten by the hand of God, i
she miserably died—a signal instance of
retribution, ami a startling lesson upon the
words, Give us this day our daily bread.1'

Race bearing north-west 65 miles, while
running in a very thick fog, we were struck
on the starboard bow about' 60 feet aback
the cut-water, by an tron' steamer, which
made three large holes in the ship, two be­
low water, one of Which was about 6 feet
in length, and 1 wide, leaving the whole
cut-water and stem of' the iron steamer
through the Arctic's side. So dense was
the fog that the vessel could not be seen a
minute before the collision.. The helm wse
put hard a starboard..-.,. r;
The engine was stopped instatly and back­
ed at full speed until clear of the other
steamer, which occupied about two minutes.
The French steamer seemed to be sinking;

Capt. Luce . immediately gave orders to
clear nway the quarter boats, which was done
and Mr: jGourley, chief officer, left the Are- .
ft'c in charge of the starboard boat On low­
ering the port boat the Captain exclaimed.
""Hoist up that boat again, Mr. Balham,"" and
beckoned me to go to him. Upon doing so
he told mo to go over the bow to ascertain if
possible what damage had been done. I
then found the holes above mentioned. Up­
oninforming him of the fact, he gave orders­
to get sails out to try and get them round
about to endeavor to stop the leak, which
was promptly done, but to no advantage
whatever, as so much of the' bow and iron
broken off the other steamer Was projecting
that the sails could not be brought close to
the vessels side. ' '
The Carpenter was then lowering down
over the vessel's side, and pillows and mat­
tresses passed down to him to try if possible,
to force them in, but the leak was found to
be so far below the water line they could
not be got in, and every exertion to stop the.
leak proved unavailing. 'Captain Luce then
ordered the ship's head to be kept ahead,
which bore N W, & W. : By this time we
had lost sight of the chief officer's boat, and
the other steamer, which we supposed: had

than 4 or 5 minutes ' before she' ran over a
boat and crew belonging to the other vessel,
all of whom perished with the' exception of
one who caught hold of a rope hanging over
the bow. Directly after the boat was seen,
orders were given to stop the engine, which
the Chief Engineer raid would not be done,
as the ship was fast sinking.'' '
In about 30 minutes, all the lower 'fires
were out, arid at least three1 feet of water in

at which the further employment of the
military force may be discontinued, and
avail yourself of the first opportunity to re­
turn with your command to t be more grate­
ful and prouder service of tfie soldier—that
of common defence.
For your guidance in tho premises you are
referred to the acts of 2Sthot February, 1705,

How Bachanaa Left the Htue*
? veuerable citizen of Washington (Mr. A.) re­
lated to ua on yesterday the following incident in
Mr. Buohanan's career. Mr. A., in the year 1818,
was the bead of a gang of ship-carpenters who
went from Kensington, near Philadelphia, to Krie,
for the purpose of building Commodore Perry's
fleet. On their way t6 Erie they passed through
Harrisburg, where the Pennsylvania Legislature
was then in session, of which body J as. Buchanan
was a member. The Legislature invited the car­
penters to attend its session, and received them
standing. But James Buchanan was so bitterly
opposed to the war that he refused to participate
in this mark of respect to these pstriotie mechan­
ics, and left the Route in disgust !
No comment is necessary on the above. Every
mechanic in the country will make his own oom­
nient on it at the polls.

THE SPIDER AND TIIE TOAD.-A Curious Inci­
dent.-The following singular relation is furnished by
a correspondent of the Bostod Traveler, as having
been witnessed by a person now living, though occur­
ring more than forty years ago, about sixteen miles
from this city :
The narrator said, that while walking in the field
he saw a large black field spider, considered of the
most venomous species, contending with a common­
sized toad. The spider, being very quick in its move­
mestls, would get upon the back of the toad and bite
it, when the toad, with his fore paw, would drive off
the spider. It would then hop to a plantain, which
was growing near by, and bite it, and then return to
the spider. After seeing this repeated several times,
and noticing that each time the toad was bitten it
went to the plantain, the spectator thought he would
pull up the plantain and watch the result. He didso.
Being again bitten, and the plantain not to be found,
the toad soon began to swell and show other indica­
tions of being poisoned, and died in a short time. If
the plantain, which grows so abundantly near almost
every dwelling in this vicinity, was such an imme­
diate and effectual remedy to the toad for the bite of
the,spider can we not reasonably infer that it would be
an ellectual cure for a man for the bite of the same
insect.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015753/1857-06-18/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,lu_pearse_ver01,"","","",true,ca,New Orleans daily crescent.,J.H.

With a deafening shriek she fell upon her knees
and cltBped her hands before ber breast. The
panther crouched for his deadly leap, but ere
he sprang, the bunting knife of Eugene Fair­
fax (who, with tbe steersman, was the only
person on deck besides Blanche,) was buried
to the Wit In his side, Inflicting a severe but not
fatal wound. The infuriated beast at once
turned unon Eugene, and a deadly struggle en­
sued. But it was a short one. Ihe pi lished
blade of tbe knife played back and forth like
lightnleg flashes, and at every please it was
buried to the hilt in the panther's body, who
soon fell to the deck, dragging the dauntless
Eugene with him. On seeing her protector fall,
Blanche uttered another shriek and rushed to
his aid; but assistance from stouter arras was
at band. The boatmen gathered round, and the
savage monster was llterallrhaeked in pieces
with their knives atid haEBeta, and Eugene,
covered with blood, was dragged from uader
his carcass. Supposing him to be dead or
mortally wounded, Blanche threw her arms
around his neck sad gave way to a passionate
burst of grief. Bat he was not dead he was
not even hurt, with the exception of a few
slight scratches. The blood with which be
was covered was the panther's, not his own.
But Blanche's embrace was hie a priceless
iraiir in IcwIay at har barl's emotions
and affections. It was to ceter bis whole f aM

geoe, tbe only eoe astir except the watch, was
suddenly startled, by a rough tjind being placed
upon bis shoulder, aceempantes by the words,
in the graff voice ef the boataMn :

"" What is it, Dick?"" inquired Eugene, start­
big to his feet.
' Don't you see thar's a heavy fog rising,
that'll soon kiver us up so thick that we won't
be able to tell s white man from a nigger?"" re­
plied the beatraaa Dick Winter by name-

gene, looking off afiea the already misty

""it looks troublous, Cap'tt, I'll allow,"" re­
turned Dick ; "" but we're in for't, that's sartiH.
and I 'sfose we'trbave to make the best on't.""
a Bat what is to be dene ? what do you ad­
vise ?"" asked Eocene, in a quick, excited tone,
that indicated some degree ef alarm.
"" Why, rf you war'nt so skeered about the
yeaeg lady, and it war'nt so dead agin the or­
ders from head quarters, my plan .would be a
el'ar and easy one I'd just run over to the
Kaistuck shore, and He up.""
"" No, no,"" said Eogene, positively; ""that
will. never do, Dick that willnever do ! I
would Bet think of such a thing for a raemeat !
We must keep in the current by all means '.""
"" Ef you can,"" rejoined the boatman ; u but
when it gits so dark as we can't tell one thing
from t'other, it'll be powerful bard to do; and
ef we dWtjun agin a bar or bank afore morn­
ing, in spite of the best e'os, Wi be the luck­
iest go that ever I had a band in. See Cap'o
it's thickening up fast ; we cant see eyther
bank at ail, nor the water nyther ; the stars is
gettin' dim, and it looks as if tbar war a cloud
all round us.""
""I see! I see!"" returned Eugene, excitedly.
M Merciful heaven ! I bope no accident will be­
fall as here and yet my heart almost misgives
me I for this, I believe, is the most dangerous
part ef our journey the vicinity where most of
our boats have been captured by tbe savages.""

as to require considerable effort, on bis part, to

he informed them, almost in a whisper, for be
did not care to disturb the others, that a heavy

Scarletina and Measles.—The following
from the Scientific American is, no doubt, wor­
thy the attention of our physicians and others :
Mr. Witt, member of the Royal College of
'Surgeons, has published a pamphlet in which he
states that bicarbonate of ammonia is a specific
for the cure of scarlet fever and measles. He
cites Dr. Peart, of Liverpool, and other practi­
tioners, who have never lost a case out of hun­
dreds since adopting this reined}7. Two drachms
of the bicarbonate of ammonia are dissolved in
five ounces of water, and two tablespoonfuls of :
the solution given every two, three, or four
hours, according to the urgency of the symp- 1
toms. No agid drink must be taken, but only :
water, or toast and w7ater. The system is to
be removed by a dose of calomel if necessary.
The room must be well ventilated, but the pa­
tient protected from the slightest cold or draft.
Gargles should also be employed for clearing
■teSSast wte ■
on the system by diminishing the frequency and
at the same time increasing the strength of the
pulse. As so many children die from these dis­
eases in this country, this remedy ought to re­
ceive a fair trial from the profession.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn89060060/1858-11-25/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,mdu_elsberg_ver02,"","","",true,ca,"Port Tobacco times, and Charles County advertiser.","E.

The infreouency of convictions as compared
with indictments will doubtless attract your
tenUon. It indicates a defective administration

ministration is committed. It is worthy your
consideration, however, whether, upon convic
tions for murder in the first degree, it may n-t
be expedient to authorize the courts to sentence
at discretion to capital puntsnmem or to impris­
onment for life. 1 am persuaded that, in many
inefanees,murder escapes all punishment, or
adequate punishment, through the reluctance
juries to find verdicts which must necessarily
be followed by sentence of death.
It is well ascertained that of crimes of
nearly one half have their immediate
in intemperance, and that more than
of the police offenses are due to the
baleful cause. It is the abundant source of
perism, Lunacy and Disease, as well as crime.
Its cost to society is beyond the power of
and its multiform influences for evil
the reach of estimate. I again invoka
your attention to this vitally important subject,

and trust that your action in regard to it may he
wise and efficient.
In this connection I think it my duty tore­
commend to you the establishment of an Any
lum for Inebriates. Much evil to individuals
aud society may be averted, and much positive
good accomplished, by means of Mich an Insti­
tution. If established on the State Reform
Farm, upon a judicious plan and scale, its cost
need not be great.
The administration of civil, not less than
that of criminal justice, is intimately related to
social condition and advancement. When cheap,
prompt, unbiased aud sure, it guaranties indus­
try, promotes enterprise, and ensures progress.
When dear, dilatory, partial and uncertain, it
impoverishes labor, discourages useful under­
takings and introduces decline. In this State
the people elect their Judges, and thus direct­
ly determine, in large measure, the character ol
judicial administration. The results thus far
especially in civil justice, have not disappoint­
ed the advocates of an elective judiciary. In­
competent judges have, it is true, been some­
times elected, and the evils ofmai-administra-tion
have been sometimes felt; but the Courts
of Ohio, considered in general, have nothing to
apprehend from a comparison with those of any
other State in respect to intelligence, learning
or efficiency. The amount of their labors may
be inferred from the fact that the number of
civil suit? last year was about 30,000, in 18,000
of which judgments were rendered. The num­
ber of suits involving serious controversy of
law or fact bore, however, a small proportion to
the whole. Much the larger number were
prosecuted for the collection of claims, and it is
estimated that nine-tenths in amount of the
debts unsecured by mortgage or otherwise.
which c'.ass constituted three fourthi of the
whole, was recovered or is recoverable. This
estimate, if at all reliable, indicates plainly the
grounds on which the high credit of the bnsi-
ness men, as well as of the State of Ohio, is
established. The whole debt of her people.
public and private, as I took occasion to show
last year, is hardly equal in amount to one filth
of the property in the State, and the loss bv i.i-
dividual failure in payment, is only two and a
half per cent, of the debt. The rate of com­
mercial hazard in credits, is, therefore, compara
tively insignificant.
Such is tbe social condition of the State, con
templated in some of its most important and in
teresting aspects. The sketch is necessarily im-
perfect, for the materials are inadequate. It
may not, however, be altogether without value,
while the provision judiciously made by you, and
the preceding General Assembly for a more am
ple collection ot statistical information will sup­
ply, hereafter, the means of more certain and
more useful comparisons aud deductions, than
are possible now.
Passing from these general views to other top
ics of perhaps more immediate coiicern, permit
me to invite your attention, in the first place, to
our financial condition.
The constitution requires that all properly, of
whatever description, and by whomsoever held,
shall be listed tor taxation at its true value.
The Revenues of the State, the Counties, the
Townships, the Cities, the Villages, and the
School Districts, are raised by rates levied, if for
State purposes, on the whole property listed,
and if for local purposes, on the property listed
within the proper territorial limits. The school
laws of various years, but particular! v of 1853
and 1854; the road and bridge laws of 1854 and
other years; the poor house act of 1831; one act
of 1857; two of 1853; and some other acts of
lcs3 importance, prescribe the rates of taxation,
The School acts direct the levy of one mill
and six-tenths on each dollar of valuation
throughout the State, for general school and li
brary purposes, and of various rates to be fixed
by the local authorities, for local purposes, such
as the construction of school houses and the
purchase of sites.

son went post baste for the minister, who,
of course, was quite ready to respond to the
dying man's summons. On entering the
room he was greeted with the cool saluta­

sion about his statesmanship and ask: What is
he worth as a irum / [Repeated chevrs.] Yes, he
mistakes the motive power which shapes the
events of history. I find that in the life of free
nations mere legal disquisitions never turned
the tide of events, and mete constitutional con­
structions never determined the tendency of an
age. The logic of things goes its steady way,
immovable to eloquence and deaf to argumeut.
It shapes and changes laws and constitutions
according to its immutable rules, and those ad­
verse to it will prove no effectual obstruction to
its onward march. In times of ereat conflict.-*,
the prompiiug* and dict>it<* of the Auman con­
tcUuc* are more potent than all the inventive
ingenuity of the human brain. The conscience
of a free people, when once fairl ruling the ac­
tion of the masses, will uevcr fail to make new
laws, when those existing ire coutrary to its
tendency, or it will put its own construction

upon tho.-c that are there. Vour disquisitions
and plausibilities may be used as weapons and
stratage r>m a fencing-match of controversion
parties, but powerless as thev are before the
conscience of man, posterity will remember
them only as mere secondary incideutsof a bat­
tle of great principles, in which the 
motive powers of human nature were the true
combatants.

There is the slavery question; not a were oc­
casional quarrel between two sections of coun­
try, divided by a geographical line; not a mere
contest between two economical interests for
the preponderance; not a mere wrang.e be­
tween two political parties for power ami spoils;
but the great struggle between the human con*
science aud a burning wrong, between advanc­
ing civilization and retreating barbarism, be*
tvveen two antagonistic systems of social organ­
ization. [Cheers. J In vaui will our impotent

vain will they invent small dodges and
call thein ""great principles;'* in tain will
they attempt to drag down ths alNabtorb­

The wheel of progressing eventswillctu»h them

read on Jlr. Douglas1 tomb-stone the inscrip­

Arkansas Moor or Kkjoyxxnt. The
slate ot society In Arkansas was excessively
""rough'1 several years since. We hope and
believe it has improved latterly. The most
frightful tragedies were enacted very fre­
quently, and the people seemed to think
nothing of them. A dangerous cutting
scrape was regarded ns a rather comical af­
fair than otherwise, as witness the following,
which is substantially trne.
Two ' desperadoes met at a tavern in
Helena one evening. They were named
respectively Tom ticroggs and Hill Pike.
Says Scroggs: 1 J
'""'How's things?'
'Peart."" says Pike.
""Heard you said you'd bleed me next time
we met,-' says Scroggs.
""That's me,"" said Pike, and two Bowie­
knives flashed fiercely forth. The fellows
backed and carved each other pretty briskly
for ten or twelve minutes, when, aa Pike's
ears bad been shaved off and his abdomen
been several time punctured, it suddenly
occurred to him that he bad had enough of
ii, anu ne sirucK uis colors.
""What's all this?"" tremblingly Inquired a
stranger who entered just as the fight ended,
""Oh, it's of no 'count"" says the landlord,
an ciuereat creature oi some zro pounds
weight, and with a face of barn-door propor­
tions, "" 'taint nothin'. Borne of the boys been
epjoiin' theirtelrei a little! That all. Won't

genial landlord set out a black bottle and a
yellow bowl of brown sugar.

aud it is equally apparent that its exercise is not ""neces­
sary nnd proper for carrying iuto execution"" any one of
these powers. So fivr from this power having been dele­
gated to Congress, it was expressly refused by the con­
vention which framed tho Constitution.

It appears, from the proceedings of that body, that on
the 81st May, 1/87, tlie clause ""authorizing an exertion ef
the force of the whole against a delinquent State"" came up for
consideration. Mr. Madison opposed it in a brief but
powerful speech, from which I shall extract bat H single
sentence. He observed : ""The use of force against a
State would look more Tike a declaration of war than an
infliction of punishment; and would probably be considered
by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous com­
pacts by which it might be bound."" Upon hi* motion
the clause was unanimously postponed, and was never
I believe again presented. Soon afterwards, on the Bth
June, 1787, when incidentally advertiDg to the subject, lie
said; ""Any Government for the United States, formed on
the supposed practicability of using force against the un­
constitutional proceedings of the States, would prove as
visionary and fallacious as the government of Congress,""
evidently meaning th* then existing Congress of the old
Confederation.

Without descending to particulars, it may be safely as­
serted, that tho power to make war against a State is at
variance with the whole spirit aud intent of the Constitu­
tion. Suppose such a war should result In the conquest
of a State, how are we to govern it afterwards? Shall
we hold it as a province, and govern it by despotic pow­
er ? In the nature of things wo con Id not, by physical
force, control tlie will of th© people, and compel them to
elect senators and represeuteti ves to Congress, and to per­
forin all the other duties depending upon their own voli­
tion, and required from tlie free citizens of a free State as
a constituent member of tbe Confederacy.
But, if we possessed this power, would it be wise to
exercise it under existing circumstances? The oliject
would doubtless be to preserve the Union. War would
not only present the most effectual means of destroying
it; but would banish all hope of its peaceable recorstruc­
tion. Besides, in the fraternal conflict a vast amount of
blood and treasure would he expended, rendering future
reconciliation between the States impossible. In the
mean time, who cau foretell what would be the sufferings
and privations pf the people during its existence I °

The fact is, that our Union rests upon public opinion,
aud can never be cemented by the blood of its citizens
shed in civil war. If it oannot five in tlie affections of
tlia people, it must one day perish. Congress possess
mooy mean* ai preserving It by coritiiUiiuu ; but tho
sword was not placed in their hand to preserve it by
force.

But may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my coun­
tryuieu to pause and deliberate, before","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83009573/1860-12-04/ed-1/seq-5,"","",5,"","",1,mdu_kale_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The daily exchange.,Kerr & Co.,"Baltimore, Md.","","",9123,6798,2797,6530,5,19149,25341,0,mdu_kale_ver01/data/sn83009573/00296026372/1860120401/0546.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baltimore,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/mdu_kale_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn83009573%2F00296026372%2F1860120401%2F0546.jp2/pct:47.642175,26.826092,14.606507,25.768517/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/mdu_kale_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn83009573%2F00296026372%2F1860120401%2F0546.jp2/pct:47.642175,26.826092,14.606507,25.768517/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Scrofula, or King's Evil,
Is a constitutional Jisewc-, a corruption of tho
blood, by which Uii fluid becomes Tltmtcd,
Meak, and poor. Helm; in tho circulation, It
pervades tho ivholc body, and may burst out
In disease on any part of It, No orcan i free
from Its attacks, nor Is thcro ono which It may
not destroy. Tho Bcrofulous taint is vnriously
caused by mercurial disease, low living, ilis­
ordcred or unhealthy food, impure air, filth
and filthy habits, tho depressing vices, and,
above nil, by tho venereal IniV.tion. What­
ever bo Its origin, It is hereditary In tho con-
Istltution, descending 11 from parents to children
unto tho third and fourth generation ;"" indeed,
it seems to bo ths rod of Him who says, "" I
will visit tho iniquities of tho fathers upon
their children.""
Its cllccts commenco by deposition from tho
blood of corrupt or ulcerous matter, which, In
the lungs, liver, and internal organs, is termed
tubercles; in the glands, swellings; and on
tho surface, eruptions or sores. Tills foul cor­
ruption, which genders in tho blood, depresses
tho energies of life, so that scrofulous constitu­
tions not only suffer from scrofulous com­
plaints, but they haTO far less power to with­
stand tho attacks of other diseases ; conse­
quently, vast numbers perish by disorders
which, although not scrofulous in their nature,
aro still rendered fatal by this taint in tho
system. Most of tho consumption which de­
cimates tho human family has its origin directly
in this scrofulous contamination; and many
destructive diseases of the liver, kidneys, brain,
and, indeed, of all tho organs, ariso from or
aro aggravated by tho samo cause.
Ono quarter of all our people are scrofulous j
their persons tiro invaded by this lurking in­
fection, and their health is undermined by it.

To which tiie following answer was re­
turned :

Rich.hoko, Aug 13'.h, 1861.
Sib r I have received your letter of 1-ih in­
stant, m which you ask to oe discharged irom
arrest and prost-cu lion,and aaab* promise mat
you wiil, ' as a citizen of Tenntsaee, submit.
io ber late aciion and religiously abstain from
any further words, or acts ot condemnation
whatever or opposition to ber Government ""
Tne desire of IbM Government being to
maintain the ii dependence it bas asserted, by
tne united feeling and action of aii its ciu­
y.ias, it bas been its policy not to enter into
q nebtions of uifferences of political opinions
nereufore existing.
1 am thereiore pleased to be spared the ne­
cessity oi inquiring wnetber the uccnsavoii
ag-tuist you oe wea founded or not, vexiii.it.u.s
or not, aad te rtst content wuh your submis­

au increased u.njority. 1 ha\e orderid your
discnarge ana tbat of your companions irom
custody. I am, £_}~ JtATt. Davis.
To thee. A. H. Msteem, £s,/.
Since my return home, i am thoroughly sat­
i tl nit tin Imy friends would have lisktd the
acttoa 1 dreaded, aud, upon the most mature
reileetioii, am content with my own course in
ilir* pieiuiaes. But whether it waa right or
wrong, vii-te or unwise, 1 tee] bound, as .mi
houorable man, to act up to the spirit and let­
ter of tte obligation I assumed. I ahall oifer
i.o plea ot duresj; because neither the South­
*-rit Coiif-'Ceracy nor any otUer aaa tiily pow­
er could have compelled me to make auagi»e­
r.v-nt wbicb my judgment and conscience did
not approve m tne situation in which 1 was
planed
Ho terms of conditions, or 
public or private, atttejaelad by release, other
i.nao tlies-? plainly exprnsued io the two above
i|-iotfd; but 1 have tn.-.ught it clue to our part
ligations nnd the painful solicitude many of
you bave felt in my behalf, that I should tans
b. i- fly address you.
While I did not promise allegiance or active
surpon to the Southern Confederacy, and
wilt not advise you to assume any obligations
contrary to your convictions of duty, I feel
perfectly free to say that the failure of the
Government of tbe Uaited States for four
loag months to sustain as in our position ;
irjs ipparent inability to do bo, since the barrtin
of Manassas, within any reasonable Mm*; the
deliberate action of our State iv the Aagaet
election , tbs ursjrances of public men that
no tea* oaths cr drafting measures will be
adopted or raqatrad: tiie mutual hatred
whioh has gray/v ap o«tweeri the antagonist
sections of th<* Unionised the recent confis­
catioti laws whicii have beeu either adopted
or propped on both aides, as well as other

eee s?l'dom fail to be unfortunate and injoririous
to those adopting them.
the disloyal citiiens of the United States
who have offered the ruin of our country, :n
return for the aid and oomfort which they
have invoked abroad, haVe received less patronage
and encouragement than they probably
expected. If it were just to suppose, as the
insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign
nations, in this case, discarding all moral,
social, and treaty obligations, would net solely,
and selfishly, for the most speedy restoration
of commerce, including, especially, the acquisition
of cotton, those nations appear, as jet,
not to have seen their way to their objeot more
directly, or clearly, through the destruction,
than through the preservation of the Union.
If we eould dare to believe that foreign nations
are aotuated by no higher principle than
this, I am quite sure a sound argument could
be made to show them that they can reach
their aim more readily, and easily, by aiding
to ?r?ah this rebellion, than by giving encouragement
to it.
' The principal lever relied on by the insurgents
for exciting foreign nations to hostility
against us. a? already intimated, is the embarrassment
of commerce. Those nations, however,
not improbably, saw from the first, that
it was the Union which made as well our foreign
as our domestic commerce, they can
scarcely have failed tr> pfcWeife that the effort
for disunion ptr>J'uce9 the existing difficulty ;
and that otie strong natien premises more durable
peace, and a more extensive, valuable
and reliable commerce, than oan the same nation
broken into hostile fragments.
It is not my purpose to review out dtsCussions
with foreign states; because whatever
might be their wishes, or dispositions, the integrity
of our country, and the stability of
our government, mainly depend, not upon
them, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism,
and intelligence of the American people, the
correspondence itself, with the usual reservations,
is herewith submitted.
I venture to hope it will appear that we
have practised prudence and liberality towards
foreign powers, averting causes of irritation;
ana, with firmness, maintaining our
a?n an/1 1?ar/v?

Since, however, it is apparent that here, as
in every other State, foreign dangers necessarily
attend domestic difficulties, I recommend
that adequate and ample measures be adopted
fojr maintaining the public defenses on every
side. While, under this general recommendation.
provision for defending our sea-coast line
readily occurs to the mind, I also, in the same
connection, ask the attention of Congress to
our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that
some fortifications and depots of arms and
munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements,
all at well selected points upon
these, would be of great importance to the
national defense ana preservation. I ask
attention to the views of the Secretary of War,
expressed in his report, upon the same general
subject.
1 deem it of importanoe that the loyal regions
of East Tennessee and western North
Carolina should be eonnected with Kentucky,
and other faithful parts of the Union by railroad.
I therefore recommend, as a military
measure, that Congress provide for the construction
of such road as speedily as possible
Kentucky, no doubt, will eo-operate, and,
through her legislature, make the most judicious
selection of a line. The northern terminus
must connect with some existing railroad;
and whether the route shall be from Lexington,
or Nioholasville, to the Cumberland Gap;
or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in the
direction of Knoxville: or on some still different
line, can easily be determined. Kentucky
and the general government co-operating, the

wor* can De eompieted in a very short time;
and when done, it will be not only of vast
present usefulness but also a valuable permanent
improvement, worth its cost in all the future.
Some treaties, designed chiefly for the interests
of commerce, and having no grave political
importance, have been negotiated, and
will be submitted to the Senate for their consideration.
Although we have failed to induce some of
the commercial powers to adopt a desirable
melioration of the rigor of maritime war, we
have removed all obstructions from the way of
this humane reform, except such as are merely
of temporary and accidental occurrence.
I invite your attention to the correspondence
between her Britannic Majesty's minister accredited
to this government, and the Secretary
of State, relative to the detention of the
British ship Perthshire in June last, bv the
Unit?d States steamer Massachusetts, for a
supposed breach of the blockade As this detention
was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension
of the facts, and asjustioe requires
that we should commit no belligerent act not
founded in atriot right, as sanctioned by pablie
law, I recommend that an appropriation
b? made to satisfy the reasonable demand of
the owners of the veesel for her detention.
I repeat the recommendation of my predetecaor,
in his annual message to Congress in
December last, in regard to the disposition of
the surplus which will probably remain after
satisfying the claims of American citizens
against China, pursuant to the awards of the
commissioners under the act of the 3d of
Maroh, 1859 If, however, it should not be
deemed advisable to carry that recommendation
into effect, I would suggest that authority

be given for investing the principal, over the
proceed* of the surplus referred to, in good securities.
with a view to the satisfaction of such
other just claims of our citiiens against China
as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the
eourse of our extensive trade with that Empire.
By the act of the 5th of August last, Congress
authorised the President to instruot the
commanders of suitable vessels to defend
themselves against, and to capture pirates.
This authority has been exercised in a single
instance only. For tbe more effectual protection
of our extensive and valuable commerce,
in the eastern seas especially, it seems to me
that it would also be advisable to authorise
the oommanders of sailing veesels to recapture
any priies which pirates may make of United
State* vessels and their cargoes, and the consular
courts, now established by law in eastern
countries, te adjudicate the ones, in the event
that this mould not be objected to by the local
authorities.
if any good reason exists why we should
persevere longer in withholding oar recognition
of the independence end sovereignty of
Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it.
Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel
polioy in regard to them without the approbatioa
of Congress, I submit for your eensideration
the expediency of an appropriation for
maintaining a charge d'affaires near each of
ihoee new states. It Is does not admit of denbt
that important commercial advantages might
be secured by favorable treaties with then.
The operations of the treasury daring the
period which has elapeed since your adjournment
have been conducted with signal success.
Tbe patriotism of the people has placed at the
disposal of tha government tbe large means

demanded by the pablie exigencies. Much of
the national loan has been taken by oitneas of
the industrial classes. whose confidence in
their eountry'a faith, and teal for their eountry'a
deliverance from present peril, have induced
them to oontributa to the support of the
government the whole of their limited acquianions.

Since your adjournment, Lieutenant General
Scott has retired from the bead of the amy.
During his long life, the nation has not been inmindful
of his merit; yet. on calling to m.nd
bow faithfully, ablv, ana brilliantly he has
served his country, from a time tar back io our
history, when few of the now living had been
born, and thenceforward continually, I cannot
but think we are still his debtors I submit,
therefore, for your consideration, what further
mark of recognition Is due to him, and to our*
selves, as a grateful people
W ith the retirement of Gen. Scott came the executive
duty of appointing, in his stead, a General-in-Chief
of the army. It is a fortunate clr­

cumstance that neither in council nor country
was there, so far as 1 know, any difference of
opinion as to the proper peraon to be selected.
The retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment
in favor of Gen McClellan for the position;
and In this the nation seemed to give a unanimous
concurrence. The designation of General
McClelian Is, therefore, In considerable degree,
the celeetion of the country, as well as of the Executive;
and hence there is better reason to hope
there will be given htm, the confidence, and cordial
support thus, by fair implication, promised,
and without which, he cannot, with su full efficiency,
serve the country.
't has been said that one bad general is better
tb in two good ones; and the saying is true, if taken
to mean 110 more than that an army is better
directed by a single mind, though inferior, than
by two superior ones, at variance, and crow-purposes
with each other.
And the same In true, in all joint operations
wherein those engaged, c?* have none but a common
end in view, and can differ only as to the
choicc of means. In a storm at sea. no one ou
board earn wish the ship t? sink; and yet, net unfrequently,
all go dnwu together, hccausc too
many will direct, and no slugle mind can be allowed
to control.
It rontinues to develop that the Insurrection is
largely, if not exclusively, a war upon the first
pilnclple of popular government?the rights of
the people, Couclusi ve evidence of this Is found
In the most grave and maturelyconsidered put-'le
documents, as well as in the geueral tone of tue
Insurgents, lu those documents we find the
abridgment of the exlstiug right of suffrage, aud
the deuial to the people of all light to participate
In the selection of public officers, except the ;
legislative, bodly advocated, with labored argu- I
meats to prove that large control of the people in
government, Is the www of all political evil. |
Monarchy itself Is wmllniii hinted at ua possible
refuge from tli# p>? the people
I n my present p sttlaa, I mild scarcely be justifled
were I to nmM r*%tnu a warning voice
against this approach of returning despotism.
It is not needed, nor flttlng here, that a general
argument should be made in fav*r of popular
Institutions; but there Is one point, with ita connections,
nut so hackneyed as most others, to
which 1 ask a brief atteutlon. It is the effort to
place capital on an equal footing with, if not
above labor, in the structure of goven.ment. It
is asiumrd that labor Is available only In connection
with capital; that nobody labors unless
somebody else, owning capital, somehow by tbe
use of it,'induces him to labor This assumed,
it is next considered whether it Is best that capital
shall hire laboiers, and thus induce them to

work by tbeir own consent, or buy tbcm. and
drive them lo It without their content. Having
proceeded so far, it ix naturally concluded that
all laborer* are either hirtd laborers, or what we
call slave*. And further, it la assumed that whoever
is once a hired laborer, la fixed In that condition
for life.
Now, there la no such relation between capital
and labor M assumed, nor la there any such thing
as a free man being fixed for life In the condition
of a hired laborer. Both then assumptions are
false, and all Inferences from them are groundless.
- Labor Is prior to, and Independent of, capital.
Cspital la only the fruit of labor, and could never
have existed If labor had not first existed. Labor
is the superior of capital, and deserves much the
higher consideration Capital haa its rlgnta,
whi<-h are as worthy of protection as any other
rights Nor is it denied that there la, and probably
always will be, a relation between labor and
capital, producing mutual benefits. The error ie
in assuming that the whole labor of oosnasanity
exists within that relation. A few men own capital,
and that few avoid labor themselves, and,
with their capital, him or boy soother few to
labor for them. A large majority belong te
neither el Ms neither work for others, nor ne*?
others working for them.
In most of the Southern fates, a majority of
> the whole people of all colors, are nnltker elnvee
nor master*; while In tbm Northern, a largo ma'

On Sunday evening, a few hours after sunset,
while wo were sitting in our tent in company
with several other specials,"" one of our num­
ber, laying his hand upon our kneo, suddenly
said to us, "" Hark, what is that !"" In a second
all had ceased talking, und tvery ear endeavor­
ed to catch the sound which had attracted the
attention of his comrade. There was a silence
for a moment, and then there was wafted ucross
the air tho music of that glorious anthem "" Old
Hundred,"" in which it seemed a thousand voices
wero participating.
All of us immediately sought the op?n air,
and there stood until the last note died away
upon our ear. Never before have we heard
anything bo magnificently grand us tho same
"" Old Hundred "" sung by the soldiers of the
Union army on the plains of Yorktown. The
air wus made vocal with tho music, and the
woods around reverberated with the mighty
strain. Beneath tho canopy of heaven tho sol­
dier gazed upward into the star-lit sky, and
sang unto God,"" from whom all blessings flow""
an anthem that stirred in th heart of man the
lust and holiest emotions. The incident was a
sublimo one either for the poet or the artist.

Olliee of Associated Press Agency — We
have reliable advices, through letters received
to-night, that affairs at Washington and Alex­
andria to-day wore a more favorable aspect.
The secessionists of tile, latter city arc less jubi­
lant and carry despondent countenances.—
Gens. Burnside and I’ope have successfully cut
their way through the rebel forces to Manassas
and have formed a junction with (lie army of
Virginia, under Gen. McClellan, this side of
Centerville. There has been a sev< re engage­
ment with the re Ik; Is, by the divisions under
the command of Generals Honker, Sturgis
and Sumner in which the rebels were complete­
ly routed and driven back from the vicinity of
Manassas and Bull Run, through the passes of
the Bull Run Mountains.
Tile loss of life on both sides is said to have
been heavy. No accurate information is ob­
tainable oil this point, but it is believed the en­
emy is very severely punished, and many pris­
oners taken.
It is also stated Unit the Potomac river is
now fordable at any point above Washington,
and much excitement prevails throughout
Washington and Maryland, arising from the
fear that a portion of the rebel army may make
a desperate ami destructive mid in that quar­
ter, but the arrangements for a proper recep­
tion of tile traitors at ail points are ample for
all emergencies of such a nature.
Tlte euemy lias not yet appeared on the Up­
per Potomac although indications have point­
ed to such an event, and the excitement on
both sides of the line continues.
The fears for the satiety of Washington are
entirely dispelled, as the defences of the capi­
tal are perfeet and impregnable. The general
feeling ot the loyal people of both Alexandria
and Washington is one of more confidence
and the impression which has prevailed among
loyal men for the past week, has given way to
that of joy and gladness. That there have
been the most extensive movements of troops
from Alexandria and other points, is beyond","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016025/1862-08-30/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,me_damariscotta_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Portland daily press.,N.A.

Calhoun died a defeated rebel chief, but iio left
b'gions of young men devoted to disseminate
his principles young legions growing up in
the faith of the principles to the establishment
of which this generation has been consecrated
in the South. We are at war with a people
who have been educated to believe that they
are contending for their liberties ; they arc
carrying on this contest with unity and de­
termination ; their armies have acquired the
solidity and consistency of regular troops. To
reduce such a rebellion will require the utmost
exertion of our force and tiie immediate use of ev­
ery advantage which naturally falls to our share
iu the contest. Their determination to obtain
success is unconquerable to subdue them their
ends must be made impossible, and the unity
which gives them strength must be ours also.
(Cheers.)
To secure this unity we must rouse ourselves
to extraordinarg exertions. Not only must
every possible means be used to damage the en
emy in the field, but we must guard vigilantly
against tho enemies in our midst (Cheers.)
VV bile you have been loyally occupied with the
defense of the country and sending your voters
to the field, the pro-slavery party has been
stealthily and busily employed in organizing to
control the elections, and to secure a victory of
which they already feel assured. To counter­
act them you must labor you must make it a
matter of individual labor in order to give this
force of unity to the work before us, and every
vote deposited in the ballot-box tells as surely
on the contest as a blood-stain;d musket left on
the field. The endurance and steady courage
of our soldiers must be supported by a united
public opinion at home, and when some brill­
iant victory flashes across the clouds of war,
let a responsive glow light up the undivided
hearts of the North. (Loud cheers )
We might make ouncessions and give up ad­
vantages if our contest was for this generation
only. If we were contending for ourselves
only, we might compromise or let it go. Indi
vidual prosperity could be easily secured here
or elsewhere where peace and stable govern­
ments reign. Rut it is for the long line of gen­
erations yet to come in whose interests we ti""bt
this battle. (Cheers.) We cannot say, "" f.
tor us the deluge,"" but must take the time with
all its obligations. Our soldiers go to the field
with no short aims. Their hopesare not placed
upon the temporary success of a battle, and the

[From Our Own Correspondent 1
EaxAaazoo, Mich., Sept. 89,1863.
I have lent you toy telegraph each day brief
but comprehensive mention of the more Im­
portant events connected with the Michigan
State Agricultural Fair, which terminated a
four days existence in thUScity on Friday
night In point of numbers present, the
managers claim that it has been the most sue*
cesefol State Fair erer held in the West, a
claim which 1 think will challenge controvcr­
tlbn. The aggregate numbers present a dose
estimate puts at 43,000, viz: on Tuesday,
entry day, 8, 8,000; Thura­
day 23,000; Friday ,15,000. The amount of
money which they left at the gate was 110,772;
Horn other sources s3,3oo—total $13,072.
This amount is larger by $7,000, or more
by 100 per cent, than was ever before
at any Michigan State Fair. The current ex­
penses have been for premiums. $3,000: enr*
rent expenses sß.ooo—totsl $6,000. As the
society owes nothing, it leaves in the Treas­
urer’s hands the handsome balance of $7,077,
which he-intends to invest in Government
5:20s for the benefit of the Society. Four
or five years ago this Sodety was $7,000
.In debt, which the Executive Board were ob­
liged to cany along ""with their Individual
notes. To-day, the $7,000 are on the other
, side of the ledger. Under this condition of
, affair*, it Is no matter of wonder that the So­
dety should Insist, with entire unanimity,
upon the continuance of the old board of om­
cersfor another year. Two of them, how­
ever, Mr. Philo Parsons, the Treasurer, and
Mr. Lyon, one of the Executive Committee,
peremptorily declined a re-election, but with
their heartfelt wishes for the continued pros­
perity of the Society, and others were pat In
their places. •
The question naturally occurs, how. were
this average of 25,000 people present for three
days,' fed-lodged and generally provided fbr
in a town which has Just, the capacity to hold
B,COO people ? We have only to aay that Kal­
amazoo did her .very best—and no town of
per alze in the West could have done belter—
m providing for the comfort other guests.
1 bcto saw a hotel so full fora three day’s
stretch as was the Kalamazoo House, ar»J if
all who wanted to enjoy the comforts at this
boose, were unable to do so, it was no fault
of the landlord's.

For each moment of the time every
inch cf room at their tables, aad every foot pf

space In their bedrooms, parlors and
were occupied by tbe hungry Snd weary, who
ftuTSjfffif.ffl But of course^
ttb and the cthi* betels In the town, were
ootu dicp b a big bucket, and although the
cittrens all m&uilcated a profuse hospitality,
there were thuusaixSa‘who were obliged to
aiaU themselves of a hospitable caltfe car,
tbtd, waKonoraoy like luxuriant quarters,
for a night a lodging. Yen fortunately there
wssno Difficulty in getting pleat/ to eat and
drak It was related to me hr the chief of
- tbe Central road, that during Thursday night
ttvcial cattle cars'were left upon the track
near the depot) and that In lose tbau fire min­
ute* after their arrlva’, they were filled by
.lodgers, many of >hem women, and that they
..were even found aaleep on the platforms of
the can. But all bore It patleutly, sod even
seemed to enjoy these privation?. There waa
nogrumblirgor ftnlt-finding, and a better
naluitd mats 1 never saw.
.1 will briifly enumerate the various depart*
nente, and the character of the conten s of
earb, firat:
Division A-tCattle.—These were divided
eff into (even different grades, viz; Short*
horns. Dtvtns, Berefords, Ayshlres, Alden*
scy», herd* of Devons, herds of Shorthorns,
cross blood and grade cattle, working oxen,
fat cattle, and milch cows.. The entries In
this division were very large, especially In
shorthorns, and embraced some of the best
siock.ln the State.' The farmers of Michigan,
for the! past few years, have spared no ex*
pentelo Improve their herds, and their cf­
lorta have resulted in producing some of the
b< st stock ever exhibited In the West.
Division B—Houses —The entry of horses
was quite large, embracing many of the most
celebrated of the class which I shall term
“paters,'.’, that is, those which appear
at every agricultural and horse £Or, and on
every race track in the Northwest Of
course, they always supply a largo share of
the amusement for tbe audience, as they did
on this occasion. There was very few of
really ueelhl “farm horses"" on the ground
and these few received little or no considera­
tion from ‘ the Committees. The entry of
car riage and buggy hones waa very large,
but few of them worthy of consideration
and only those who could show tbe fewest
r?' * around the course. Tbe most excit­
i contest was the trot for the citizens'
in»se of S3OO on Saturday alter*
noon. : For this, three well known
“palters"" were entered, viz: “Magna Char*
iV’owricd by F. B. Smith, of Coldwater.
Mich; “Scalpel,” owned by Wm. Patrick of
Chicago, and “Silas Rich,"" owned by Simon
Anderson of Chicago. “Magna Charts"" la

Bucccspfrilly through tbe contest, his success
would have been certain and overpowering.
Do was ante to get Utile the advantage on the
mostanvwhero elsewhere be could
make It pay. The race for the beat three in
five, “Magna"" won the beat and tbo hearty
plaudits of tbe multitude In 2,81, and the see*
ond In the same time and on the same terms.
Bets were freely offered on him,
two to one, and even four to one,
by almost every friend and freely taken. On
tbe third heat “Magna"" betrayed his friends
and backera, as he has frequently before.
He behaved badly, and waa beaten by
, “{Scalpel"" olmoflt out of eight. A
fourth boat waa but a repetition of the third,as
far as “Magna"" waa concerned, “Joalah
Rich""; proved to bo tho first none in.
3gna” was then ruled out by tho
es, bnt for what reason was not stated,
the contest lay.betwccn the two Chicago
horses. The fifth heat was won by “Joslsh
Rich.” in 3;37 to 2:37* by “Scalpel,"" bnt as
“Joelah"" had gained more than the difference
by running, tbo heat was declared for
“ScalpeL"" The sixth heat waa (imply alre pe­
tition flfrbj and -the Jndges gave the
Division C—Sheep, Swine and Podltut.
fhe show in this division was inferior, and
not entitled to special mention. A greater
portion of the sheep were of the Spanish
merino breed. '

Dmsiox D—Fabm Imflxuznts.—Tho ex­
hibition of Cum implements was very good,
particularly in reapers, mowers and plows.
Tne entries of reapers and mowers com­
bined and separate, and combined, embraced
tho patents of John F. Manny, John H. Man­
ny, wood, Hubbard, Faber, Kirby, Ac., Ac.
There was a great variety of seed drills, hay
rakes, borae pUchforks, Ac., on the irround.
The Divisions £, F, Q and-B embraced
household and dairy manufactures, domestic
manufactures, paintings, statuary, Ac., and
flowers. There were many specimens of taste
and skill In these several divisions, bnt we
have not room to notice them in detail. Tho
department of H embraced fruit of all kinds,
and was a very fair exhibition, bnt not such
as would do credit to the progress which
Michigan has made In fruit culture.
Division K.—This departmeot embraced
miscellaneous articles not included in the
other divisions. Among the entries was Prot
Button's Continuous Non-insulated Light­
ning Conductor, to which a first premium
was awarded, io opposition to one offered
upon something of the same principle, tbe
latter not being continuous, and the copper
drawn over iron. We have already spoken
of Prof. Button's Invention, and the action
of the Committee has vindicated the opinion
wc have expressed that his lightning conduc­
tor is founded upon the laws which control
electricity, and vriU in time supersede tbeuse
of other lightning-rods, particularly those
coDstructeoof iron, which time and exposure
have proved nearly worthless.
I should like to write more of thia Fair,
but my Mmo and your limits yrill not permit.

tor the time rein stated. He took a promi­
nent part in the battle of Murfreesboro, and
has been conspicuous in all the later opera­
tions of Gem Kosecraua’ army. In person
Gen. Thomas is peculiar. He is fully six feet
high, but his figure is so large and square
it seems to rob him of severalinches of stature
Sondyish hair; keen blue eyes of medium
proportions, sunken under shaggy brows;
straight nose, not strikingly prominent, but
strong: ruddy features, deeply seamed;
square face; large, compact head; heavy but
firm step; there yon have the physical man.
Ho is patient, persevering, even tempered
and energetic. Gem Bosecrans is said to en­
tertain for him an exalted esteem.

The Rebel General Rood.

Major-General John B. Hood, of the rebel
army, reported killed, was bom in Kentucky,
about the year 1833, and was consequently
aMutthlrty-oneyean old when ho wnskm­
ed. He entered West Point as cadet daring
V1® graduated on the 80th oi

Qenowlßdiofieia, Brigadier-General Robert
O.Tylw,Brigadier-General Terrill (klUedat
renyvllle),Brigadier-General Sheridan, com­
manning a dlTiflon otßosecrana’ army; Gen.
H. H. Walker, of the rebel army, and
others. On the Ist ot July, 1854, he
hrevetted second lieutenant of the
4th United States Infimtry, and on the 3d of
March, 1855, was transferred to the 2d cav­
alry with the 101 l rank of Second Lieutenant.
He commanded a detachment became dis­
tir guithed In the conflict with the Comancbes
anaLlpans near the head ot the R*"" Pedro
River, In Texas, on the 30th of July, 1857. It
* was during this contest that he was severely
wounded. On the 18th ot August, ISSS, he
was promoted to First lieutenant, and was
placed in charge of Camp Colorado, near San
Antonio, Texas. He was in Texas at the
breaking out of .the rebellion, and resigned
his connection with the United States army

| On leaving the cause of the Union he be­
came at once connected with a rebel regi­
ment as colonel, from which rank he was pro­
moted to a brigadier-general. He operated
* so.l?* time in the vicinity of Korfolk, and

Loogstreetfs corps. With this com­
mand he took part in the umona battle of.
pe-Jy»J>w*g, where he was severely wounded

only resumed his command a few weeks,
perhaps only days, when he was ordered to
Join Gen. Bragg in the southwest.

A French Journal, the Phare deta Loire,
states that two steam clippers In coarse of
construction at Nantes, and two sister ships
building at Bordeaux, wore suspected of
being Intended for the rebels, to be delivered
at sea twenty leagues off Belle Isle.
The vessels are eighty metres long, are to
have engines of 400 horse power, will carry
twenty two guns, and tbcii guaranteed speed
Is to be fourteen knots an hoar. Speed would
appear to be one of the main objects aimed at
In their construction, as they are remarkably
narrow,' and- their stems are sold to be os
sharp as the blade of a razor. Avery suspi­
cious circumstance In.connection with them
Is. that they are to be delivered up at sea,

ally believed, the Phare de la Loire says, that
these vessels Ore intended for the Confed­

tr The following extract from the letter of a pri­
vate in a New York regiment is one of tho moat touch­
ing narratives of tho war that we ever remember to
have met with. The earlier portions of the letter are
devoted to a description of a harried march made by
tho regiment on the evening preceding the great bat­
tle of Gettysburg; and after mentioning a halt of an
boor, which wu allowed, and which, Indeed, was la­
dfipcmaidy necessary to the men,who were completely
worn out by the terrible fatigue* of the day's nurch,
the hero writer proceeds as follows:

“ The word was no sooner given than we dropped to
the ground where we stood, and as we stood, almost
os one man, we stretched ourselves on the ground

A Speech by Lord Brougham—His Views

American War and on the French

Occupation of Mexico.

' Lord Bkooohah delivered an elaborate ad
dress at the opening of tbe Seventh Annual
Meeting of the National Association for the
promotion of Social Sclenoe at Edinburgh, on
Ootober 8, , Iq the coarse of his speech he made
the following reference to the Mexican ex(eil
tlorj, and Amerioan topics In general.
A (treat, and bnt for its snooets, a very no
popular expedition baa resulted In tbe occupa
tion ol Mexico dv tne rrenon wovernmont, and
the foundation of a monarchical rtgmt, nearly
upon the principles adopted la Frauoe, both as
regards the power of the Grown and tbe rights
of the people. It is Impossible to question the
advantages derivable from the ohange by the
Mexicans, tibo tor so many years naa eunered
all tbe evils of alternate anarchy and the vio­
lence and plunder of petty tyrants. Nor osn
any friend of humanity end of peace begrndge
the influence acquired by Franoe, or cavil at
the 1' mf6 ' 'D fTOr ot Austria. The
geaceof the Continent la furthered by whatever
rings these two great powers Into a friendly
connection. - ' .

causa for lamenting anything so manifestly
tending to promotetheeontlnoanoeof the war,
and j extend its mischiefs. The term olvll war
is no hardly applicable to thla miserable oon

Amerloina themselves, and, though in a much

Tbe feeling toward England which prevails
among the Amerioan people, though arising
from tho excess of national vanity, and its
kindred envy, le certainly in part the remains
of the old quarrel that led to the separation.
we are baled and despised; neither feeling is
at all reciprocal, but among oar kinsfolk it
prevails In a degree almost amounting to men­
tal alienation; it ein be hardly accounted for
wlthont recurring lo Ihe ancient grudge of the
American war; and ii illustrate tne soundness
of the view taken . by those who have moat
considered Ihe great subject of colonial policy,
that we mast so govern our settlements as to
prepare for a separation on friendly terms, al­
ways assuming that sooner or later tbelr growth
will bring about their independence; Some
distinguished mea la the literary as well as po­
litical world have lately maintained Ihe opinion
that onr colonies ere only a burden, and that
they give us no benefits worth tbe expense they
entail. This is a great error, and it Is not now
for the first time that 1 so desorlbe it. Wxjy
years ago, wUlle residing here, I published a
work In wbloh the whole subject was fully ex­
amined In ell its branobes,and a demonstration
given of the beneGu political, social and com­
mercial of oolonlal establishments, with de­
tailed proofs that their cost falls far short ol
their benefits, and that the wara ascribed to
them had another origin: . The book was very
soon ont of print, and I have always refused lo
allow a seoond edition. It might now, bow­
ever, be of some use, as the Information con
tained respecting the colonies of ail nations
ought to be more generally diffused.. The
lapse of sixty years has no donbt mado great
changes, and tbe work is to be viowod as nu­
torloal with resard to Ihe fact: but tho doo
tru.ee have been confirmed by all that has hap.
penedr they are entirely applicable to Che pres­
entjatate of affairs, and aro most wotthjof at
leniion from the promoters of social sclenco.
Hid lordship then briefly passed In review the
progress made by our colonies In tho last sixty
years, and wbat has been done In the way of
emigration, and then turned to tbe considera

I was walkin’ along the street, lookin’ so
galliant nu’ gay, in me brass kote and bloo
buttons, an’ other military harness, when s.
excited femail rusht out ov a house, throw’d
her plum: handles aroun’ me neck—which ;

“0, her you cum back—her you cum

my neck.
“Certainly, I’ve cum back,” sez I, “or

I know you muchly.”

nose, his ears his—~”
l ‘Madam,’ sez I, ‘excoose me, but allow me
to correct you. Ef I air not mistaken, these
earses, an’ eyeses, and noses, belong to my­

owned 'em rcarcely !’
‘Away with this furoe,’ sez she. ‘You
can’t deseeve your own Claretts. Cum into

It was evident the femail was mistaken—
that it was not me but another man she

Dow conld Hr. Smith do otherwise than vole for

every man, not a Yaliandighamer, in his district
desired him to vote. We believe he did right; and
we believe that nine-tenths of hia constituents will
sustain him for so dome. We go farther, and aav
that it was hia duty, under the choice presented, to
vote for Hr. Colfax, though he knew every man in
hie district was opposed to his doing so. Mr. Col­
fax was tbe representative man of those who arc
for crashing the rebellion, and restoring the Union
ender the Constitution; Hr. Cox was the repre­
sentative man of those who are for permitting the
Government tb be destroyed; who are for refusing
to furnish additional men and money to suppress
the rebellious Insurrection. Under this oath then

it was Hr. Smith's doty to do as he did. - Had wc

Cobden suggests to a French writer the fol­
. lowing sharp summary of the'relations be­
tween the British public and the London
Times: “Ifit is fair to say that the Times
makes English opinion, it is equally fair to
say that English opinion makes the Times.
It would be hard to find anapter illustration
of a ‘vicious circle.’ M. De Tocqueville has
somewhere observed on the remarkable qual­
ity which England has of ‘alwaysesteeming
her own interest to be Identical with jus­
tice ;’ but England must have arguments to
demonstrate this identity and secure to her
the satisfaction and assurance which arc the.
props tofu good conscience. Who can better
discharge this sometimes not very easy task
than the Times? The art of shading off from
admiration into indifference from indiffe­
rence into hostility, from hostility into cal­
umny. is perfectly well understood by the
Times. * * * The fable of Narcissus Is
eternally true; England will love the Times
as long as the Times remains the faithful mir­
ror of England’s sell”

FROM ST. LOUIS.
Capture and Banctnw-Gncrllla Out*
break Threatened—Xne Border State
Freedom Convention*

[From Oqr Special Correspondent!
St. Louis, Feb. 12,1851.
The capture of the guerilla leader Bolin
end hie subsequent execution by the citizens
.of Cape Girardeau, is the only event in mili­
tary circles ■which has disturbed the serenity
of the week. This fellow Bolin was a public
assassin and one of the worst scoundrels
who ever escaped a worse death than hang­
ing. Die gang was part of the force which
has hitherto been under Sol Kiichcm and
Sim Bcctcs, hovering along the roads in
Southeast Missouri, pouncing on Government
trains whenever they found one unguarded.
The dispersion of this gang, and the hang­
ing of Bolin, will have-a happy effect on
other guerillas in' that region.-Therel are’
good grounds for snpposlngthat tliesegueril­
las designed firing pn some steamboat be­
tween Cape Girardeau and Cairo, for the sake
of the plunder. The prisoners < who have
been questioned regarding this design, owned
up, and the precaution of sending' oat a
scouting party after such scoundrels was well
timed.

There is considerable agitation in various
parts of the interior oh the subject of another
uprising of guerillas in the spring- It is well
known that there ore hundreds of returned
rebels in tho country, who have only left the
Southern army because they' couldn't
get. chough to eat They arc not
a whit less hostile to the Union-than when
serving under ttie banners of 'Jcff'D.wU. bnt
they arc quiet just now for expediency's
sake. Arms and ammunition in suspicious
quantities have lately been ordered for sus­
pected localities. It is asserted that Qnan­
trel has already established his headquarters
in Lafayette and Jackson counties and is
gathering recruits for another Lawrence
massacre; Gen. E. B. Brown,who commands
the Central District, has .removed Ills head­
quarters from Jefferson City to Warrens­
bnrgfa, off the railroad, so as to he nearer
Ihci guerilla district. Oar cavaliy in tlmt
quarter have received hew horses,
and are. now ready for the r bels in
any ""form.’ If the guerillas do • tiy
the Bvirtnc .of another outbreak in the
heart of the State, it will not be exactly safe
,lor those who pretend to sympathise with
tho rebellion who have anything of value to
lose.

Geo. Hosecrans is still about upon offlclil
duty at Louisville. The duties of guiding
Hie Department during his absence, are en­
trusted to Assistant Adjutant General Oliver
D.'Grccncl an officer whose good sense and
judgment is fur superior to a majority of his
predecessors. It is rather amusing:, than
otherwise, to observe the patronizing airs
assumed by some of the conservative chaps
talking of Bosccrtins. They arc certain wo
will disappoint the radicals, and satisfy the
cravings of every conservative in the laud.
In a few days the General will return*, and
then it is expected there will be some changes
in the personnel of tlio* Department officers.
Cot Thos. C. Fletcher has been recommended
for Provost. Marshal General by a host of
people. lie has the endorsement of all the
Missourians in Congress,and of a majority of
the Legislature.
An enthusiastic meeting was held on Mon­
duy evening to elect delegates to the Border
State Freedom Convention, to be bold in
Louisville, Ky., on the 22 d. Several inter­
esting speeches were made, and thirty-two
delegates appointed to attend the Conven­
tion. Major David Murphy stated that he
had just returned from Lonisvillc and hid
heard that there would be considerable op
Losition to the holding of the Convention in
Louisville ai all, and the Major intimated
that delegates had better go to Kentneky
armed. This was a mere suggestion, of
course; but there is one thing which may be
depended npon. These delegates have fought
slavery in Missouri face to face, and stood up
and confronted Its champions too often to be
alarmed by the threats of. Lonisvillc rowdies
or Copperheads. They are going to that city
to meet in a peaceable'conveation to.discuss'
the gravest questions connected with the
; welfare of the Horder States. They don’t
propose to interfere with any institution, or
any set of men-while holding , the Conven­
tion. Bat go they will at all hazards.
: The long, pending railroad agitation' has
been brought to an end in this State for the
present, by the adoption of what is known
; as the anti-sell-out scheme; or in other words,
the Directors are allowed to issue afiist mort­
gage on that portion of the route hereafter
built, thereby giving the extension itself as
security for the money 'loaned to complete
the road to Kansas City. The proposal made
, on behalf of Gcu. Fremont and others, to
i buy the road for seven millions, cost. the
. State considerable’money.* by impeding legis­
i latlon. Tour old friend, Gen. McKinstry,
} was in Jefferson City for several weeks, as­
j slstlng the lobby to procure the adoption of
; the Fremont seU-out scheme.' Much money
: was spent for wine, cigars and oysters, but
; the sell-outers did not succeed. Strangely
i enough, these men were accused of trying to
j prevent the completion of the Pacific Rail­
| road to Kansas City, in order to throw the
t trade of Kansas. New Mexico, Colorado and
i Utah over the Hannibal and St. Joseph Rail­
-1 road, to help Chicago. Now that the Fre­
i monters are beaten;there Ison insane yelping

Hand.

Why it Opposes the North,

It Fears the Growing Power of the

Itepnbllc*

The speech of Mr. Gibson mores the Lon­
don Time* to the following editorial utter­
ance, in which, for the first time, it openly
■declares the purpose of its continued hostility
‘to the United States: *

When Mr. M. Gibson gives his unreserved
and'unqualified homage to* the federal cause,'
he knows not how. much of a sort is his wis­
dom ahdtbat of the “ model Republic,” as it
used to be called the other day. ' The United
Statee'Werer a system complete in itself; a
new world disclaiming all affinity and sym-,
pathy with the old; a new bond*, of union
that was to destroy all other unions, and ab­
sorb their materials. Tho new volcano was
to cat out the heart of the ancient mountain,
and rcar lts uniform geometrical cone to tho
skies. Wherever, by-inevitable chance, the
new creation came in contact with the old,
with old feeliqgs, old- rights,* old habits, old
opinions, there was no compromise, no Join­
ing of the’ broken bones, no healing of the
sore, r,but simply life, health and -universal
extension to the new, and defiance, destruc­
tion, confusion, abolition, extermination,
death to the old. . Truth and 'justice
are the common ground and mean be­
tween all . nations, but ! not between
tho: United States and the, rest of “the
world. In all differences tho only measure
of their demands was, what they were likely
to get by playing on the fears, or the scru­
ples of other States. Their territorial max­
ims had no other reason than the will of the
tyrant Their ftiturc was terrible, gigantic,
universal,, crushing and overwhelming, till
the vision itself became on incabas, and
thoughtful men began to sec, that if this was
the American future, then America bad no
future. Such was the Republic in its unbrok­
en ‘ integrity,’ as Mr. M. Gibson calls it
Tills was the dream which began to frighten
tho Old World, aud which Mr. M. Gibson
thinks it most unreasonable that the south­
ern States should contemplate with dismay.
It was the dream of an Ainas char, which he
himself dispelled with a kick. The southern­
ers were daily told of a universal organiza­
tion in which the sovereign will of a majori­
ty should override all constitutions, all Inter­
national law, all Institutions, every right and
Interest that stood In its way. They dreaded,
and it mnst be said they might justly dread,
the fall brunt of that tyranny which they had
long known, and which, no doubt, they had
helped to create, hut which now they saw
about to be turned upon themselves. Can
we. who know the utter unscrapulousness
and theboundlcss aggressiveness of American
politics, wonder at the apprehensions of those
who found they were speedily to he done by
as they had done, aud that when the balance
ofpower passed from the South to the North,
the South would find it was to be trodden
under foot?

“ Mr. M. Gibson clings to this compactand
uniform schemu of universal federation, a ty­
rant majority, and general assimilation of
habits and opinions. He hopes it may still
bo realized, or, if not quite in our time, yet
pnt again in the way to be realized. The ca­
lamities of the stairs arc a loss to as, he says,
and If we don’t fret ourselves about them It
is from apathy towards the Bufferings of our
own people. The Confederates, too, he says,
have betrayed the blackness of their policy,
and made a glory of their shame. They have
atowed that they intended, and still intend,
to establish a mighty slave-republic which
shall restore slavery and perpetuate it to all
time.- For this matter, the Confederates have
had no choice but to set up a positive policy,
for it would have been impossible otherwise
to conduct the war and maintain a standing­
ground in the opinion of mankind. As- to
the feeling of this country, It is true, wo arc
not justified in regarding with exultation or
satisfaction so terrible a calamity as that
which has befallen so many millions of onr
own race. Nobody of common feeling does
hear' of the mutual slaughter and
other sufferings entailed by tbc' war
without commiseration. But ; while
the republic tvns overtopping and
overshadowing as, while it stretched its limbs
and raised Us tones to the scale of a giant, it
was Impossible bat that our sympathy should
be weakened. We feel for men, not giants,
for monsters, for madmen, for those altogeth­
er out of our rank and. species. Bat grant
that the commcrciallnjuzT Is great, and that
the general derangement; of trade, threatens
to inflict even more scrioas injuries, yet it is
impossible to prevent political considerations
from intruding themselves, and even making
a set-off the other way. llr. M. Gibson can­
not, surely, demand from ns that wo should
absolutely wish the. United States to retain
tbeir ‘integrity,* or now recover it, so as to

Startling Utterances of

Treason.

Vailandigham’s Speech ‘at
Monmouth, 111.

HE EXPLAINS lEE “BASIS OF
THE FEDERAL STATES.""

He Proclaims the Democratic Party Opposed
to oie Government mm the At­
lantic to the Pacific.

[Coneepondence of the Chicago Tnbnne.l
Monmouth, lIL, Oct. 
C. L. Yallacdlgham in his speech at Mon­
mouth, to-day, made substantially the fol­
lowing statement: The- Democratic party
are in favor ol a reconstruction of the Union
on the basis of .the Virginia and Kentucky
resolutions' of ITBB,**'[State Governments.]
• Wc are opposed to centralization of power tn pni
gotemtneni extending from the Atlantic to the
AeiJUf which would be one of the worst des­
potisms oirtarth. We are In favor ol is re­
construction of the Union oh the principles
of State Sovereignty, [the sameas the Mont,
gemery Rebel Constitution.] And hence
WZ STBUOKOUT or THE CHICAGO PLATFORM
THE IDEA or A RESTORATION OF THE UNION
ON THE BASIS OF THE FEDERAL UNION OF
the States, and inserted In lien thereof;
1 upon the basis of the Federal States.’ ” .
This Is substantially his statement,, and*
very nearly his exact language, as can be
proven by p large number of intelligent wit­
nesses of both parties, and the statement
will not probably be denied. I took care to
compare my understanding of the statement
with that of a number of others of both
parties, at the time, and found that we all
understood him alike.

Here then is the authoritative statement of
cf the maker of .the second resolution o! the
Chicago Platform, and High Priest* of the
Sons of Liberty, as to how it read when
made; and why it was made. Aud it settles
the question of veracity between the Union
and Copperhead press, as to which is the
authentic version of that precious docu­
ment. It also establishes the fact that that
Platform is identical in principle with the
doctrine of “States Rights,” as held and
practiced by the States now In rebellion; os
promulgated by the Niagara conclave, City,
Holcombe, and Sanders; and as held and
taught by the “Knights of the Golden Circle,”
“ Sons ol Liberty,” &c. It Is not “ the Union
as it was, and the Constitution as It is,” but
disunion, and, in principle, hold treason.
'What further link of evidence is now
needed to show that the Democratic party,
under Us present control, is in league with
the various secret treasonable organizations
in the country, and the rebels of the North,
and ihclr emissaries in the North aud in
Canada, to destroy the supremo Federal
Government of onr fathers, and in one form
or another, (o secure the .independence of
the'seccded States? Whatever may, by any
possibility,' be said of General McClellan,
Vallandieham knows his man, and is work- ,
mg for him; and he being the high priest of
the “Sons of Liberty,’’and having taken an
oath to “support, maintain arid defend” the
doctrine ot State rights, as opposed to our
Federal Union, of course be would not sup­
port McClellan if he did not hold similar
views, or if he was not linked indissolubly
to those views by the platform of the
Convention which nominated him.

A vote, then, for McClellan, is a vote lor
the destruction of our Government and the
establishment of a Southern Coulcdcracy.

FROM BAMILTOiN COUi^TF,

Gen. Logan at SKeLean*boro—Copper*
bead outrages.

[Special Dirpatcb to the Chicago Tribune.]

McLZAKEBORO, II&mlltOD CO., 111, »
Friday, Oct. 28,1804. f
To-day at an early hoar, the citizens of
Hamilton and adjoining counties began to
throng the streets of McLeansboro, and by
noon cot lees than four thousand people hid
reached town. About II a. m., Maj, Gen.
John A. Logan, accompanied by Oen. L N.
Hajnle and IT. 8. Marshal D. L. Phillips, was
met by a large procession of citizens, headed
by a most magnificent surer band from Ev­
ansville, Ind., some distance from, town, and
cecortea to the hotel amid thousands of most
enthusiastic friends and admirers. Never
before has this town seen such an audience.
Banners, hags, and mottoes of every kind
were seen scattered through the audience.
At 1 o’clock, Gen. .Logan commenced a
speech of vast compass and power. Before
he had proceeded far, he was rudely inter­
rupted by a brace of Copperheads, who had
perched themselves in the window of the
upper story of the Court House for that es­
pecial purpose. The General retorted,where­
upon the Copperhead pair most Infamously
insulted him. They were then told by Gen.
' Logan that he would allow no man to insult
him, and if such a thing were attempted, he
-would blow their infernal brains out. This
effectually checked farther impertinence till
the close ot the meeting.
Never was Gtn. Logan more eloquent than
towards the dose of his speech, when he
portrayed the sufferings, the privations, and
heroic deaths of our orave soldiers strag­
gling for the preservation of the Union, and -
reslstence to armed traitors in the field,
while traitors at home are engaged in the bel-.
lish work of treason. Hundreds of men and
women literally wept like children. I have
never before witnessed such a scene. The
effect was perfectly, overwhelming.
At night the streets of the town were filled
with more people than were ever before seen
in the night time in this town. While a vast
procession, carrying torch-lights, transparen­
cies and banners, atd headed by a band of
music, was marching through the streets,
it- ’was assailed by a set of coward­
ly, infernal / wretches with., stones and
other missiles, and a number of persons
most* seriously injured, bnt without in the
least breaking up the procession. After para­
ding the streets for an hour or more, the
people assembled again and were addressed
bv Gen. Haynie and Marshal Phillips, who
bitterly flayed the Copperheads, amid show­
ers of stones hurled by cowardly and
scoundrelly traitors from the surrounding
darkness. Two orthree ladies were struck,
and one of them, a Mrs. Sharp, most seri­
ously ""wounded. The speakers denounced
the wretches in unmeasured terms, and de­
fied and dared them to an open fight.
At the close of the meeting, Gen. Logan
ond'the speakers remained on the ground,
awaiting an attack, and, if it had been made,
more Copperhead funerals would have been
seen on the following day than ever'before
in McLeansboro. The hell-inspired brutal
violence shown here by the followers of Sam.
S. Marshall, a citizen of the town, has eter­
nally disgraced him, and made hundreds of
votes for the Union ticket.

The canvass now being made by Gen Lo­
gan and others, in thin portion of Illinois, is
the most extraordinary ever made ia the
Northern States. It ia being made amid
threats of murder, assassination, and vio­
lence. Bnt the day of doom and damnation
speedDy approaches.
Gen. Logan is doing greater service for Ms
country than when leading to glorious vic­
tory the Istb Army Corps.

county, Ohio, was executed in the county
jail in Cleveland, at seven minutes past one
o'clock, on Friday, the '*th ilist. lie had
eloped to Pittsburgh with this girl of seven­

murderer in history, and his law not God's
law. Hefaaid there was no sense in mur­
dering him. He did not believe that Christ
was the son of God, &c. He was killed in­
stantly by the fall—six feet two inches. Not
a muscle moved in the act. Some two hun­
dred persons were present in the jail, and a
crowd of perhaps a thousand blocked up the
jail gates and filled the adjacent streets. The

the Isle of Mona Society, and will be given
decent burial. Rev. Mr. Thome acted as
the spiritual counsellor of Dr. Hughes, aud
made a very touching and eloquent prayer
upon the scaffold.

S.bJ!Cd/rKUVtrC\lloine of Bosl°n State llonsu
cn the 4th of July, several years since. The
light was so powerful that common newspa­
per print could be read by H all over the
Common. But to produce it required five
hundred cells of zinc, carbon and acid a
cumbrous, clumsy and exiamslvc appa­
ratus. Sir. W tide dispenses with all this
and performs bis wonders by the combina­
tion of six small permanent magnets weigh-
Ing only a pound each, a ten-inch electro­
magnetic machine, having an electro-magnet
weighing three tons (which accamnlotc* and
retains the developed electricity, on the
same principle as un Insulated submarine
cable or the Leyden jar), and an armature
revolving within an Iron cylinder at the rate
of fifteen hundred turns a minute. The cyl­
inder Is about a foot long, and has a bore of
two and a half Inches; tho armature which
plays within it, not touching the sides is
coilt-d about with Insulated coppcj wire. It
is from this armature, when the different
ports of the apparatus have been connected
and put into operation, that the electricity
is evolved and the effects ore produced.
These effects arc astonishing. An arch of
electric light, several inches long, spans Uic
space bclwccn tbc polar terminals of fixed

shine. This fact, when first announced to
the scientific world, was received with lu*
credulity, but it Is tbc truth. Two enter­

since put up the machines in their shops,
and now do all their copying and enlarg­

Colonel Samwl S<hoch, Columbia, Pennsylva­
nia? Dear Sir:?You are right In supposing
that. Congress made mistakes, as is the Inev­
itable lot of man: but yon mistake in supposing
that there is any law to prohibit tbe removal
of district commanders without tbe consent of
the Senate. Soon after tbe commencement of
tbe last session of Congress 1 reported a bill
from a committee of tbe House of Representa­
tives wbich contained provisions prohibiting
removal without content of tbe Senate. It
passed the House and was sent to the Senate.
Tbe Senate struck it out and returned it to the
House, which refused to concur in the amend­
ment. Tbe result was a committee of confer­
ence, where an animated con'est ensued. There
were several other questions in controversy
between the houses which the House offered
to yield if this could be granted. The Senate
perseveringly refused, declaring that they
would sooner lose the bill. As that would
frustrate all our legislation it could not be al­
lowed. The Honse yielded with a warning of
tbe evil it could inflict npon the country.
Some of tbe members of tbe Senate seemed to
doubt*thetr power under the Constitution
which they had just repudiated, and wholly
outside of which all agreed that we were act­
ing, else our whole work of reconstruction was
usurpation: or, perhaps, they had a desire to
be thought to be gravely conservative and
magnanimous. These iaeaa seemed to control
tbe action of some half-a-dozen Senators, wbe
preferred trusting tbe President. My dear
Colonel, a few Senators of great ability, un­
doubted patriotism and purity, have become
so satnrat?d with what they are pleased to call
conservatism, (whose meaning I confess I am
unable to understand,) that 1 fear they will
forget the monster that was slain in 177fi, and
again in 1S?1, and will thns do great damage
to the creation of a government now so capa­
ble of being converted","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1867-08-28/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,dlc_alf_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Evening star.,W.D.

A Qukf.r Wedding.?The Hartford Post
relates a curious incident near that city.
Mrs. Eliza Barnsley, a young war widow,
had been conrted and won by a young
lawyer from Providence, who spent his
vacation in tho neighborhood. The day
for tho marriage was fixed and all the
arrangements made, but at the appointed
hour the bridegroom came not. Ho had
gone from the town in an early train. Tho
bride was disconsolate, the friends out­
raged. Worse thau all, the dinner was
getting spoiled by waiting. Seeing this
state of affairs, one of the invited guests,
a middle-aged farmer who had been a
secret admirer of Mrs. Barnslcy, and whom
sho had encouraged before the lawyer's
advent, stepped up, offered to take the
groom's place, and was accepted. They
were married, ate their dinner, and promise
to make a happy couple.

ns a good ono by thoso who have tried it :
""Cabbages aro preserved very simply;
they aro left out as lato ns they can bo

up aud turned upsido down, the roots up
and tho bends packed closo together, in

levelled whero tho cabbages arc placed, ho
that they pack nicely. They arc left in this
way two or three weeks, or as long ns the
ground cau be dug between tho alleys, the
soil from which is thrown in on the bctl.i

is iu no way injurious. Some prefer to cov­
er them up nt once by plowing a furrow,
shoveling it out wide enough to rcceivo tlio
heads of tho cabbages, and then turning the
soil in on the heads, and bo continuing until
bods of six or eight feet aro thus formed.
This plan is rather nioro expeditious than
the former, but it has the disadvantago of
compelling them to be covered up at onco
by soil, whilo tho other plan delays it two
or three weeks later, and it is of tho utmost
importance in preserving vegetables that tho
operation (particularly tho final covering)
bo delayed as late in the season as frost will
permit. Generally more arc lost by begin­
ning too soon thnn delaying too late.
Onions, wo find, are best preset ved in a burn
or stable loft, iu layers from eight to ten
inches deep, covered up with about a foot
of hay or straw on the approach of Bcvero
frosts. Tho great points to be attained nro
a low tempcraturo and a dry atmosphero;
they will bear twenty degrees of frost with­
out injury, provided they nro not movod
whilo frozen, but they will not stand a re­
duction of tempcraturo much lower than
this without injury.""","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026403/1867-10-26/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,pst_deike_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Sunbury American.,H.B.

peror of Russia; and it now seems impera­
tive that the more obvious necessities of
the Atlantic coast should not be less care­
fully provided for. A good and conven­
ient port and harbor, capable of easy de­
fence, will supply that want. With the
possession of such a station by the United
States, neither we nor any other American
nation need longer apprehend injury or
offence frome any transatlantic enemy. I
agree with our early statesmen that the
West Indies naturally gravitate and may
be expected Ultimately to be absorbed by
the continents 1 States, including our own.
I agree with them, also, that it is wise to
leave the question of such absorbtion to
this process of natural political gravita­
tion. The islands of St. Thomas and St.
John, which constitute apart of the group
called the Virgin islands, seemed to offer
us advantages immediately desirable, while
their acquisition could be secured in har­
mony with the principles to which I have
alluded. A treaty has, therefore, been
concluded with the King of Denmark for
the cession of these islands, and will be
submitted to the Senate for its considera­
tion.

It will hardly be necessary to call the
attention of Congress to the subject of
providing for the payment to Russia of
the sum stipulated in the treaty for the
cession of Alaska, the possession having
been formally delivered to our commis­
sioners. The Territory remains for the
present in care of a military force, await­
ing such civil organization as shall be di­
rected by Congress.
The annexation of many of the small
German States to Prussia, and the reorgan­
ization of that country under anew and
liberal constitution, have induced me to
renew the effort to obtain a just and
prompt settlement of the long vexed ques­
tion concerning the claims of foreign
Slates for military service from their sub­
jects naturalized in the United States, and,
in connection with the subject, the atten­
tion of Congress is respectfully called to a
singular and embarrassing conflict of laws.
Tne executive department of this Govern­
ment has hitherto uniformly held, as it
now holds, that naturalization, in conform­
ity with the Constitution and Laws of
the United States, absolves the recipient
from his native allegiance. The courts of
Great Britain hold that allegiance to the
British crown is inalienable, and is not
absolved by our laws of naturalization.
British judges cite the courts and law au­
thorities of the United States in support
of that theory, against the position held
by the executive authority of the United
States. This conflict perplexes the public
mind concerning the rights of naturalized
citizens, and impairs the national authority
abroad. I called attention to this subject
in my last annual message, and now again
respectfully appeal to Congress to deelare
the national will unmistakably upon this
important question.
TIIL AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE.
Thu abuse of our laws by the clandes­
tine prosecution of the African slave trade
from American pr-ts, or from American
citizens, has altogether ceased, and under
existing circumstances, no apprehensions
of its renewal in this part of the world are
entertained. Under the circumstances it
becomes a question whether we shall not
propose to her majesty’s government a
suspension or discontinuance or the stipu­
lations for maintaining a naval force for
the suppression of that trade.

New Yore, February 29. The World 1

Washington dispatch states that in the
executive session of the Senate yesterday
an important resolution by Mr. Sumner,
was principally nnder discussion. It

proposed that the Senate should hold no
intercourse with the President, in view
of the fact that the House of Represen­
tatives had deolared in favor of his im­
peachment After considerable discus­
sion, the resolution. was voted down.

The Timet' Washington dispatch says

ez-Governor Thomas Ford, of Ohio, who

has been dangerously ill for several

weeks past, is now convalescent, and

hopes are entertained of his full recovery

to health.

The amount to be paid into the treasury

from the sales of confiscated and captured
cotton, by the provisions of the bill which
will pass the Senate to-morrow, is nearly
$30,000,000. The final passage of the bill

ill prove ,a severe check on claimants,
ho, to be successful, must pass a severe

ordeal, as to their position and record

uring the war.before the Court of Claims

ill entertain their cases.

The President has nominated Joseph

H. Rowland Marshal for the Western
District of Arkansas.

The Stanton-Thomas case in the Dis

trict Court will not come up till April.

Cheap Pleasures.
Did you ever study the cheapness of
some pleasures? asks some excellent writer.
Do you know how little it takes to make a
multitude happy? Such trifles as a penny,
word, or a smile, do thework. There are
two or three boys passing along give than
o.mh ft ehesnut. and how filing they look !
i ;n ,.t be cross tor some jtimc. A
nnnr widow who lives in the neighborhood,
who is the mother of a half a dezen child­
ren ; send them half a peck of sweet apples
and thev will be happy. A child has lost
his arrow the world to him, and he mourns
sadly : help him find it,or make him anoth
er, and how quickly will the sunshine play
upon his sober face. A boy has as much as
he can do to pile up a load of wood ; assist
him a few moments, or speak a pleasant
word to him, ond he forgets his toil, and
works away without minding it. Your ap
prentice has broken a mug,or cut a vest too
large, or slightly lrjured a piece ot worn.
Sav. ""you scoundrel,"" and he feels misera
ble ; but remark, ""I am sorry,"" and he will
try to do better. Y'ou employ a man pay
him cheerfully, and speak a pleasant word
to him, and he leaves your house with a
contented heart, to light up his own hearth
with smiles of gladness. As you pass along
the street, you meet a familliar f ice say
""ffood morning,"" as though you felt happy,
and it w ill work admirably in the heart of
your neighbor. Pleasure is cheap who
will not bestow it liberally ? If there are
smiles, sunwhine and flowers all about us, let
us not grasp them with a miser's fist and
lock Lhem un in our hearts. No. Rather
let us take them and scatter them about us,
in the wiudow of the cot, among the groups
of children in the crowded mart, where men
of business congregate, in our families, and
everywhere. We can make the wretched
happy, the disc inted cheerful, the afflicted
resigned, at an exceedingly cheap rate.
Who will refuse to do it?

S\n Francis oa, Oct. 23, lsea.
Some details of the destruction of property la the
luterior of the State by tile earthquake of the :41st
lust. have been rece veil.
Alameda county Buffered moat. Alameda county
Ilea ou the east aide of the bay of r~un Francisco, and
directly opposite the peninsula which includes the
county and the city of Sau Francisco. The aarnage
to property in Alameda extended in all directions.
Hack of the town of San Leandro, In the northern
part of Alameda county, there are numerous Assures
in the earth, from some of which issued clouds of
dust, and from others volumes of water. Sau
Leandro creek, which had been dry for months,
as is usual at tlrfs season of the year, is now a
rapidly running stream. In some places hot water
and steam gushed from the ground. The villages of
San Leandro and if ay ward's arc almost in ruins.
These villages are fifteen or twenty miles apart. The
brick buildings were all thrown down and a hundred
tenements have been rendered uninhabitable. Nu­
merous wooden structures were much damaged.
At ilayward's there Is only one building remaining
uninjured. The towns of Alameda, Itrooklyu and
Oakland all suffered severely.
The destruction of property in the towns of San
.lose and Redwood City was very great. San Josr,
the first capital of the State, is in Santa Clara county,
which adjoins Alameda on the south, and Redwood
City is in Sao Mateo county, which adjoins San Fran­
cisco county on the south. The brick and adobo
buildings in the ""old mission San Jose,'1 which is
some miles east of the town of Sau Joae, are a mass
of ruins.
At Sacramento city, Stockton and Marysvtlle the
Injuries to buildings are slight and the losses small.
In the towns of I'eteluma. Healdsbnrg, Santa Rosa,
Vallejo and Martinez the full force of the shock was
felt; chimneys and Are walls were thrown dowu and
the damage is considerable.
The localities of some of the towns here men-i
tionedl may be described as on a line ranjrinjr gene­
rally north from the north side of the entrance to
the bay of Sau Francisco, extending through the
coast counties of Marin and Sonoma for 100 miles
or thereabouts. *
At Los Angeles, say 250 or 300 miles in a direct
line, a little east of south, from San Francisco, and
at Visalla, say 250 miles southeast of San Francisco,
the shock was slight and no damage was done. The
towns of Santa Cruz, Monterey and Watson ville, on
the coast south of San Francisco, suffered very little
damage, in the State of Nevada the shock was
scarcely felt.
The committee of San Francisco architects ap­
pointed by the lioard of Supervisors have reported
that the City ilall building Is unsafe and will have to
be taken down. Meanwhile the courts and city
officials will have to flml temporary quarters else­
where. The other city buildings we're not injured to
any great exteut. The damages to the school houses
St ove trifling and the schools will open as usual on
londay next. The large building on lllncon Point
| occupied by the Suited Stales marine hospital has
been condemned by the proper authorities. The
stability of the foundations or this building was
long ago considered impaired by excavations
in the hill on which it is situated. The
hospital ,pat leuts are at present encamped on the
grounds adjoining the institution. No proper ac­
commodations have, as yet, been provided for them.
The Custom House is wrecked to such an extent
that it will probably not be occupied ugaiu. The of­
ficers have removed temporarily to Haywood's build­
ing, on California street.
An army of laborers are at work to-day ou the shat­
tered buildings and removing the di'brls from the
streets. The merchants exhibit no disposition to
abandon their property or their locations. Some
structures are being taken down entirely and others
are undergoing repairs. A busy scene Is presented
iu the neighborhood of the wrecked buildings.
Some further damage was done by the shock at
fifteen minutes past two o'clock tliis morning.
Several buildings and some of the lofty chimneys of
the several manufactories that suffered considerably
by the first shock will now ha<ve to be entirely de­
molished and rebuilt. No definite estimate of the
damage to property can be made until a proper sur­
vey of the entire city has been made. Some esti­
mates place the loss at $300,000, others at (2,ooo,or>o.
The latter figures are probably nearest to the truth,
as quite a uumber of costly buildings will have to be
torn down and reconstructed, aud extensive repairs
made on many more.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030313/1868-10-25/ed-1/seq-7,"","",7,"","",1,dlc_juneberry_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The New York herald.,James Gordon Bennett,New York [N.Y.],"","",2604,1422,3646,10716,7,18303,26196,0,dlc_juneberry_ver01/data/sn83030313/00271743646/1868102501/0309.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_juneberry_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn83030313%2F00271743646%2F1868102501%2F0309.jp2/pct:14.227176,5.428310,19.920232,40.907009/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_juneberry_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn83030313%2F00271743646%2F1868102501%2F0309.jp2/pct:14.227176,5.428310,19.920232,40.907009/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

and vigor imparted to every branch of indus­
try. Our people need encouragement, in their
efforts to recover from the effects of the rebel­
lion and of injudicious legislation; and it
should be the aim of the Government to
stimulate them by the prospect of an early re­
lease from the burdens which impede their
prosperity. If we cannot take the burdens
from their shoulders, wo should at least mani­
fest a willingness to help to bear them.
In rcfeiring to the condition of the circulat­
ing medium, I shall merely reiterate, substan­
tially, that portion of my last annual message
which relates to that subject.
The proportion which the currency of any
country should bear to the whole value of the
annual produce circulated by ics means is a
riuestion upon which political economists have
not agreed. Nor can it be controlled by legis­
lation, tut. must be left to the irrevocable laws
which everywhere regulate commerce and
trade. The circulating medium will ever irre­
sistibly flow to those points whore it is in
greatest demand. The law of ""demand and
supply is as unerring as that which regulates
the tides of the ocean ; and indeed currency,
like the tides, has its ebbs and flows through­
out the commercial world.
At the beginning of the rebellion the hank- >
note circulation of the country amounted to
aot much more than two hundred millions of
iollars ; now the circulation of National Hank <
notes and those knowa us “legal tenders” is
nearly seven hundred millions. While if. is i
jrged by some that this amount, should be in- i
ireased, others contend that a decided reduc- i
ion is absolutely essential to the best interests I
)f the country. In view of the diverse opinions, <
t may be well to ascertain the real value of our i
taper issues, when compared with a metallic <
tr convertible currency. For this purpose, let I
is inquire how much gold and silver could be <
purchased by the seven hundred millions of j
naper money uow in circulation? Probably '
lot more than half the amount oi the latter— i
ihowiqg that when our paper currency is com- t

pared with gold and silver, its commercial value
is compressed into three hundred and fifty mil­
lions. This striking fact makes it the obvious
duly of the Government, as early as may be
consistent with the principles of sound political
economy, to take such incisures as will enable
the holder of its notes and those of the Na­
tional Banks to convert them, without loss,
into specie or its equivalent. A reduetiou of
our paper circulating medium need not neces­
sarily follow. This, however, would depend
upon the law oi demand and supply, though
it should be borne in mind that by making
legal tender and bank notes convertib le into
coin or its equivalent, their present specie value
in the hands ol their holders would be en­
hanced one hundred per cent.
Legislation lor the accomplishment of a re­
sult so desirable is demanded by (he highc.-t
public considerations. The Constitution con­
templates that the circulating medium of the
country shall be uniform in quality and value.
At the time of the formation of that instru i
tuent, the country had just emerged from the
War of the Revolution, and was suffering from
the effects of a redundant and worthless paper
currency. The sages of that period were aux
ious to protect their posterity from the evils
which they themselves had experienced.—
lienee, in providing a circulating medium, they
conferred upon Congress tfie power to coin
money and regulate the value thereof, at the
same time prohibiting the States from making
anything|but gold and|-ilver a tender in payment
of debts. *
The anomalous condition ol our currency is
iti striking contrast with that which was origi­
nally designed. Our circulation now embraces,
first, notes of the National Banks, which arc
made receivable for all dues to the Government
excluding imposts, and by all its creditors, ex­
cepting in payment of interest upon its bouds
and the securities themselves; second, legal­
tender notes, issued by the United States, and
which the law requires shall be received as well
in payment ol all debts between citizens as o<
all Government dues, excepting imposts; and,
third, gold and silver coin. By the operation
of onr present system of finance, however, the
metallic currency, when collected, is reserved
only lor one class ol Uoverement creditors,
who, holding its bonds, semi annually receive
their interest in coin from the National Trea­
sury. There is no reason which will be accept­
ed as satisfactory by the people, why thoie
who defend us on the land and protect us ort the
sea; the pensioner upon the gratitude of the
nation, bearing the scars and wounds received
while in its service; the public servants in the
various Departments >f the Government; the
farmer who sunnlics the soldiers of the army

and the sailors of the navy; the artisan who
toils in the nations workshops, or the mechan­
ics and laborers who build its eiiticcs and con­
struct its forrs and vessels of war—should, in
payment of their just and hard-earned dues,
receive depreciated paper, while another class
of their countrymen, no more deserving, are
paid in coin of gold and silver. Equal and ex­
act justice requires that all the creditors ol the
Government should be paid in a currency pos­
sessing a uniform value. This can only be ac­
complished by the restoration of tiie currency
to the standard established by the Constitution
and by this means wo would remove a discrimi­
nation which may, if it has not already done
so, create a prejudice that may become deep­
rooted ami wide-spread, and imperil the na­
tional credit.
The feasibility of making our currency cor­
respond with the constitutional standard may
be seen by relereuc^ to a few facts derived from
our commercial statistics.
The aggregate product of precious metals in
the United States from 1ST.) to 1 SOT amounted
to $1,174,000,000, while, for the same period,
the net exports of specie were $741,000,000.—
This shows an excess of product over net ex­
ports of $433,000,000. There are iri the
Treasury $103,407,985 irq coin; in circulation
in the States on the Pacific coast about $40,­
000,000, and a lew millions in the National
and other Hanks—in all less than $100,000,000.
Taking into consideration the specie in the
country prior to 1849, and that produced since
1807, and we have more than $300,000,000
not accounted for by exportation or by the re­
turns of the Treasury, and therefore most pro­
bably remaining in the country.
These are important facts, and show how
completely the inferior currency will supercede
the better, forcing it from circulation among
the masses, and causing it to be exported as a
mere article of trade to add to the money cap­
ital of foreign lands. They show the necessity
of retiring our paper money, that the return of
gold and silver to the avenues ol trade may be
nvited. and a demand created which will cause
the retention at home ot at least so much of
the productions of our rich and inexhaustible
gold-bearing fields as may be sufficient lor pur­
poses of circulation. It is unreasonable to ex­
pect u return to a sound currency so long as the
Government and banks, by continuing to issue 1
irredeemable notes, till the channels of circula­
tion with depriciated paper. Notwithstanding
a coinage t y our mints, since 1849, of eight
hundred and seventy-four millions of dollars,
the people arc now strangers to the currency
which was designed for their u>c and henelit,
and specimens of the precious metals bearing
the national device are seldom seen, except
when produced to gratify the interest excited
by their novelty. It depreciated paper is to
he continued as the permanent currency ot the
country, and all our coin is to become a mere
article of traffic and speculation, to the en­
hancement in price of all that is indispensable
to the comfort of the people, it would he wise
economy to abolish our mints, tints saving the
nation the care and expense incident to such

be exported in bullion. The time has come,
however, when the Government and National
B inks should be required to take the most el­
lieient Slops and make all nceeassary arrange­
ments for a resumption of’ specie payments.—
Let specie payments once be earnestly inaugu
rated by the Government and banks, and the 1
value of the paper circulation would direct ly i
approximate a specie standard. '<
Specie payments having been lesumed by ;
the Government and banks, all notes or bills u!
paper issued by either of a less denomination I
than twenty dollars should by law be excluded i
from circulation, so that the people may have *
the benefit and convenience ot a gold and silver t
surrency which in all their business transactions <
will be uniform in value at home and abroad, i
“Kvery man of properly or industry, every <
man who desires to preserve what lie honest- t
ly possesses, or to obtain what he can honest- 1
ly earn, has a direct interest in maintaining a 1
sale circulating medium—such a medium a- .

brato with opinions, not subject to be blown up t
)r blown down by the breath ot speculation,hut -
lo be made stable and secure. A disordered j
currency is one ol the greatest political evils.— i
It undermines the virtues necessary lor the s
support of the social system, and encourages c
propensities destructive to its happiness; it '

General James Longstreet has written the
following patriotic letter:
Lynchbcbo, Va., Nov. 24 My Dear Sir:
Many of our Southern men seem to have lost sight
ot the fundamental doctrine the interest of the
people In their zeal to matntRin their ideas of
consistency, which consists in adheriug to old
truths whether they wotk for weal or lor woe.
I reeret that I am not better prepared to meet
jour wishes for Information in regard to the
future policy ol our new Piesident. Although I
have had the pleasure ol several interviews
with him, within tbe last few years, I have not
sought to learn his appreciation of political
questions of the present or of the future.
1 regard his past course and decided character
as the surest guarantees of his future course.
The floating idea that has attached itself
to tbe minds of the many, that he may yet prove
to be a Hemocrat, is like many other specula­
tions that gain circulation and credence; but
only serve to deceive those who are credulous
enough to indulge them. It we recall to mini
the events of the lat two years, we shall re­
member that General Grant's position at one
time was such as to insure his nomiuatlon for
President by the party that he might choose as
most in acjord with his views ot public policy;
and subsequent events indicate that his personal
popularity is such as to have turned the balance
in bis favor. It seems to me unreasonable,
therefoie, to expect to find him, at this late day,
seeking alliance with the old party. His ante­
cedents clearly mark him as a national man,
and of such he gives assurance ot his adhesion
to the party whose basis is the Union, and that
tbe influence of his administration will be
applied to its complete aud prosperous restora­
tion. A fair-minded people must know,
however, that no individual, unaided, canaccon-pli-h
this great purpose. Ue must needs have
tbe assibtance of the North, of the South, of the
East, and of the West. Having assurances of
co-operation from other parts of the country,
he only wants that of the South to complete the
ccmbluation which will give to his administra­
tion a happy advent, and comfortable anticipa­
tions of its salutary progress. That the people
of tbe South desire practical reconstruction
there can be no doubt; but it seems to be diffi­
cult to develop that sentiment so as to produce
practical results. Ditlting along in the channel
into which chance seems to have thrown me, I
begin to find myself, like many others, ready
with my theory. As It may interest you, I eive
you a concise statement of it. If you find that
you can make it useful, you are at liberty to do
so: The wealth of the South lies in its soil.
If this proposition is true, its sequents are
equally so.
1. Labor Is essential to make that wealrh
available. 2. To command labor, laws must
encourage and protect it. Also theirco-se-quents.
To encourage aud inii'e labor, evi­
dences of protection must be made manifest
through the operation of law upon labor that
we have. Hence.it appears that the value of

our jaurts depends upon our labor, our labor
upon the law, and tho law upon us. A failure
upon our part, therefore, to enact and enforce
proper laws, will be as fatal to the Interests of
the owners of real estate as confiscation. And
yet, all that Congress asks us to do is to avail
ourselves of the only means by which we may
avoid serious depreciation of our material in­
terests. That is, this will be the practical
result of reconstruction, under national legisla­
tion, npon our interests The moving cause ot
that legislation, probably, was ""security for the
future."" Here we may discover the line that
should mark our connection with reconstruc­
tion. It begins and ends iu our care for home
interests. It will be time enough to benin to
look into the luture when we have provided for
the present. The politicians of the old school
seem anxious to impress upon the minds of
our young men the importance of reiectinir
all propositions coming from the Republican
party, or else they dishonor their own blood
and the blood of their falieu comrades. But
gpotlemen should remember that they only dis­
houor their comrades when they dishonor them­
selves, and that there cannot be dishonor in
ready obedience to law and a proper care for
our own welfare. On the contrary, to discard
thf law and expose ourselves to unnecessary
difficulties is near nklu to dishonor. It Is true
that runny worthy persons are dislrauchised
under the law, but the readiest and surest means
of relief are through the law. I conclude, there­
fore, that interest, and duty, and honor demand
that we should place ourselves in a condition
to support the laws of Congress. When we have
done so, we shall receive abundantly of help
from tho Executive, and from the other mem­
bers of the Government. I remain, very truly
yours, James Longstreet.

A A'mishiy MUloGIrl'd Viewn of f,tfc.
From the Chicago Times.
I'm only ? little girl, bul I think I
have as much right to say what 1 want
to about things as a boy. 1 hate boys ;
they're so mean; they always grab all i
tbe strawberries at the dinner table, ,
and never tell us when they are going
to have any fun. Only I like (ius Kog- ,
era. The other day Gns told niohe was ,
going to let oQ aoiiie fireworks, and he
let Bessie Nettle and me go and look at
them. All of us live in a hotel, and his ,
mother's room has a window with a
balcony. His mother was gone out to \
buy some creme <ie lis to put on her face, j
ami lie'd went and got eleven boxes of ,
lncifer matches, and ever so many j
pieces of oastile soap ; he steeled theui ;
trom the housekeeper. Just when she (
went to put them in her closet, Gus ,
went and told her Mrs. Nettle wanted j
her a minute, aud while she was gone j
he grabbed the soap and matches, and |
when she came back he watched her;
Hnd she got real mad, and she scolded \
Delia (that is the chambermaid), and |
said she knowed she did, and I was real |
giad, because when I was turning som- |
ersets on me mother's bed the other f
day, Delia slapped me, and said she j
wasn't going to make the bed two times j
to please me ; then Bessie and me stick- i
ed the matches in the soap like ten pins, ,
and i*us iired them oil', and they blazed ]
like anything, and they made an awful j
smell, aud t*us went and turned a little *
gas on so's his mother would think it j
was that. j
I We got our dinner with the nurses, >
cause the man that keeps the hotel ]
charges full price for the children it j
they sit at the table in the big dining- |
room. Once my mother let mego down (
with her, and I talked a heap at the ta- i
ble, and a gentleman that sat next to us ]
said, "".Little ulrls should be seen aud t
uot heard."" The mean old thing died *
.. . . 1- 1 T ...... nln.l T -

ItiHt WWft, BUU A noa acbi piau, uuu jl i
told Delia so, and she said if I went and
said things like that I couldn't, go to <
Heaven. Much she knows about it; t
aud I wouldn't want to go if dirty c
things like she is went there. Yesterday >
Mary, our nurse, told li&Bsie Nettle's nurse
that she heard .Larry Finnegan
was going to marry her. Larry is one
of the waiters, and he saves candies for
me from the big dining-room; and Bessie
Nettle's nurse said, ""Oh, Lord!
what a lie!"" and Bessie Nettle went
into her mother's room, and her little
brother said she nipped him,and Bessie
said, ""Oh, Lord ! what a lie!"" and you ]
should have heard how her mother did
talk to her, and went and shut her up
in ji dark room where she kept her j
trunks, aud didn't let her have nothing
but bread and water; and Ons Kogers
went and yelled through the keyhole,
and said, ""Bessie, the devil is coming to
fetoh you,"" and Bessie screamed and
almost had a tit, and her mother told
Mrs. Kogers, and got Gus licked, and
(ins says he's a mind to set tho house on
tire, some day, and burn tier up.
One clay J went, into the parlor and
creeped under tho sofa, and there
wasn't nobody there. They don't let
dogs nor children go into tho parlor,
and I think its real mean; aud I had to
creep under the sold, so nobody could
see me; aud Mr. Boyce came in, and
Miss Jackson ; she said one day that
children was worse nuisance than dogs.
And Mr. Boyce and Miss Jackson came
in and Bitted down un the sofa; and he
said, ""O Louisa, Idoloveyou so much,""
and he kissed her, lor I heard it smack.
And then she said, ""O Thomas, I do
wish 1 could believe you; don't you

never kibs anyuouy else ("" Ana nesaiu, i
'No, dearest,"" and I yelled out, MOb,
wliit ? big story !"" for I saw bina kiss j
Jiessie Nettle's nurse in the hall one i
night, when the ;;as was turned down. '
Didn't he jump up; you bet? and he i
pulled ineout and tored my trocfc, and ?
he said, ""O you wicked child where do J
you expect to no to for telling such j
stories?"" and I told him, ""You shut up, t
1 ain't going anywhere with you."" 1 1
wish that man would die, like the other ?
one, so I do; and J don't care whether H
he noes to heaven or uot.
C*us Kogers's mother had a lunch j
party in her parlor, and they had *
champagne, and they never gave him
any; and when his mother wasn't look- v
inv, he found a bottle hall' full on the \
sideboard, and he stealed it, and took it
in our nursery; and Mary vasd't there, i
and Gusand me drinked it out of the
gl ;ss Mary brushes her teeth in; and it (
was real nice; and we looked in Mary's
wardrobe and iound her frock she goes
to church in; and (Jus put it on, and 1
Mary's bonnet, loo; and we went in the ?
hall, and we tumbled down and tored
Mary's irock, and made my nose bleed;

and Oils said, ""Oh, there's a earth- n
quake!""'cause we couldn'tstaud up; *and
.you should see how the housed ill

laid down on the carpet, and the {

without anv reason, that perhaps tbe bomb had

satisfaction that Michallof lay Immovable on tty*
ground near hls legs. But his eves at that mninenC
met the sparkling rose of the whirling bomb not a

ing all other thought* and feclii^p*—took poeata­
sioo of him. He covered hla with.his han.v«.
Another record passed—a second in which a
whole world of feeling?, thoughts, hopes and rec­
ollections passed through hi* mind.
“Whom wIUU kill; me or Michallof ? or botlk

HISTORY OF THE TWITCH ELLS ^STATEMENT OF
UBS. TWITOHELL.
The Philadelphia Transcript publishes the
following interesting details of tho history of
the Twitohell family, not heretofore printed :
Mrs. Twitohell was born in Washington, her
mother being then known as Mis. Wornt z. Her
father was Revolver Spencer, a Methodist
olergyman of some reputation. lu 1814, the
mother and daughter removed to Ciuoinnati,
remained there four years, during whioh time
Camilla was known as Miss Sawyer, ber moth?
er having a married sister ot that name. This
is probably the origin ot the story that Mrs.
Twitchell was thc illegitimate daughter of a
member ot Congress from Ohio. lu 1848, Mrs.
Worn ts and daughter came to Philadelphia,
and the former married Mr. Hill. * Shortly
afteiword, Camilla married Riobard. Martin, a
desk in ft dry goods st ire. After living to?
ge.her five years, Mai tin left, his wife, alleging
acts of impropriety on her part, but shu took
the initiative in subsequent proceedings for
divorce, which culminated in a legal separa?
tion iii 1833. Camilla then resumed the name
of Sawyer, returned to her mother's house,
and lived t leie with ber and Mr. Hill. She
then .became acquainted with Twitchell, Sr.,
then a widower with several children, includ?
ing Gooree S. Twitohell, jin illegitimate son,
who had been born in Brooklyn, his mother
dying Boon after bis birth. Camilla was en?
gaged as housekeeper, and removed with
Twitchell. Sr., to Mew Jersey, lt is denied
most positively by all parties that there was1
any improper intimacy between Mr. Twitchell
and his housekeeper. On the contrary, Camil?
la's conduct is represented to have been
blameless. She was a member of Dr. Lord's
church, iq Broad-street, near Chestnut, and in
her character aa housekeeper was paid regular
wag aa, and for extra a rvioea received extra
Eay. When George S. Twitchell roached man­
ood he was accepted as the suitor of his fa?
ther's housekeeper, and in 1864 was married.
We have already said that Mrs. Twitchell
was not yet ready to give to the public a for?
mal statement ; hut while m prison awaiting
trial, rn conversation with prison officials, she
made a partial explanation, which has never
been published. When informed of her hus?
band's conviction and the probabilities of her
own fate, she remarked, .? I know nothing of
this murder. That afternoon George andi
were out riding, and when we-got back to (he
house ino th or was getting tea. As Sarah
Campbell had gone out, I noticed that George
was very much do Dressed in spirits. He never
was much ot a talker, bu*, this night he was
quieter than usual. He scarcely spoke at al).
At the table and after supper I said to mother
there is something the matter with George.
Suppose you go and talk with him while I olear
away the things ;, and when I got through I
wont to my room, and George was then in the
sitting room reading the paper and smoking a
cigar. I went to bed, and I don't know how
long I slept, when I was aroused by the cry of
Sarah Campbell in the kitchen. This ia the
only statement she has ever made, whatever
she may have communicated to her counsel.
The Transcript continuos as follows:
. Why Mrs. Twi choll oeased her visits to the
prison, at the outset, it may ba well to inform
our readers thai on the day ot the inquest she
appealed to her husband to tell what ne knew
of the murder, and that, if he was guilty, to
act like aman and relieve her. This ne refus?
ed to do. Alter her .acquittal she did cali at
the prison, but instead ol the greeting on her
part being war n and affectionate, it waa as
cool as would naturally be the case of one wno
looked upon ber husband as the murderer of
ber mother. Immediately after her ncquittal,
Twitohell and bis friends commenced paving
the way to a statement from Mrs. Twitohell,
which would take from him the charge and
transfer it to bis wife. So shrewd were the
Iiarties engaged, that one of them visited Dan­
el Dougherty, Esq., to ascertain- from bim
whether a person once acquitted on the charge
of murder could be tried a second time, al?
though there be a confession of guilt. The re?
sponse being that there could not be a second
trial, the efforts were renewed with ie­
doubled vigor, until Mrs. Twitchell'a friends
heard of them and advised her to absent her?
self from prison. She always denied any com?
plicity in the murder,, and her ioara of confes?
sion by him were based on the fact that she
knew that he did not believe in tbe immortali?
ty ot the soul, and that his professions of
{>ioty were designed merely to further his ef­
orts in the game ot lifo winch he vfns playing.
Others beside herself had every reason to tool
assured that be would not hesitate to save his
lite, for thom is every reason to believe that at
least one human being, George S. Twitchell,
Jr., confessed his crime and made himself sole
actor in the tragedy. Throughout thia effort
to indu e his wifo tc take upon herself an
unjust rtecuB.itiou in order to save his life,
Twitohell had frequent conversations with her
friends, who, anxious as they were to assist
him, could not overlook the damning proofs of
his own gtidt. They saw tbe in lieront improb?
abilities of his confession, and they ware anx?
ious to have some parts of it explained to tbe
satisfaction of the public A day or two before
his doa th His strong love of life led him again
to refer to it, and he rom irked to bis aunt,
Mrs. Moore, ""It is bard that I have to die tor
this thing."" Mrs. Moore then inquired of the
prisoner, ""How can YOU account tor the blood
that was found on your shirt?"" Twitched m­
lated to her the circumstances of tho murder
in keeping with bis so-called confession. Be
told her how ""hs was amused bv bis wife call?
ing him; that he went down into the diring­
room and was there told that she had quarrel?
led with ber mother and had mi*erler?:d her.
My first impulse was to alarm tho neighbors,
but my second impulse waa to save
my wife."" iwitchell then stated to Mrs.
Mooro the circumstance* attending the
throwing of the body (rom the window. He
asserted that be grasped tho bodv of the mur
dered woman Joy the head aud shoulders, whde
his wife took hold of the feet. They then boro
*

the body ot the window and rested it on the
sill, in whioh position it was held by Twitchell
while bis wifo ran down stairs and out into tho
yard, immediately under tho window. When
she roached this position Twitchell quietly
lowered the body into tho arms o', his wife, by
whom it was laid at length upon the pavement.
In this way he oooounted for the oiroumstauoo
that tho body was not found thrown together
as it might have been if hurled violently from
the window, but laid out in a straightened posi?
tion. Twitchell concluded by saying that be
supposed the blood came upon bis clothing by
his having bold of the murdered woman in tho
manner described Mrs. Moore inquired what
became of Camilla's clothing? How was it that
it was not as bloody as yours? To this he
responded that ber clothing was carried off.
In the face of all those confessions, Mrs.
Twitchell has remained quiet. She realized
that if sho denied the story whilo her husband
wes alive, she would be accused of an attempt
to insure his death. She was willing not to
tell what she knew if that would be of any sor­
vioo to him. She was also willing to assist him
to the extent of her means, but '.vbon he wish?
ed her to go a step further and assert herself
guilty of a crime she did not commit, she left
him.
It is antioipated that in a few days Mrs.
Twitchell will make a full statement in her own
behalf.
FORBIGK SUMMARY.
-The ladies of Hungary have asked Parlia?
ment to authorize the Queen of Hungary (tbe '
Empress Elizabeth ot Austria) to appoint
twenty female members of tho Hungarian
House of Magnates.
-The Queen ot Holland recently made an
attempt at suicide. Domestic troubles are
said to In ve driven her to the rash act. Her
life was save J, however, and steps were taken
to hush up tho whole matter.
-The Pope is said to entertain the intention
of conferring on the Prin se Imperial of Franco
the title of Roman Patrice, which was once
destined for the Emperor himself, and which
was last borne by Charlbrnngne.
-As a proof of the remarkable declino of
Alexandre Dumas' popularity as a romancist, it
is ment oned that the manuscript of bis last
novel was offered to six publishers, none of
whom would give bim more than a few thous?
and florins for it.
-For the last two years the English military
system hos undergone a severe ordeal from the
criticisms of the press, and tho public mind ie
being prepared for the discontinuance of the
sale of commissions. A more thorough knowl?
edge of the elements of drill and discipline ie
also perpetually being impressed.
-Mr. Vernon Harcourt, ""Historious,"" of the
London Times, is said to be extremely unat?
tractive in person and manners. One of the
London papers tells the story as current among
the dubs, that six gentlemen mutually agreed
to dine together, each asking the most unpop?
ular man of his acquaintance to join the p irty,
thus making twelve in all, and that when the
company assembled there were but seven to
sit down to dinner. Each bad selected Mr.
Harcourt os his most unpopular acquaintance.
-Some rather curious statistics have been
collected in reference to the coto position of
the British House of Commons. It is said to
contain 338 university graduates, among whom
ire 151 of Oxford and 122 of Cambridge. Th ero \
Eire 287 members who wero educated at public i
schools. 131 at Ebon, 68 at Harrow. 29 at Rug?
by, and the remainder in smaller number i at
athens. Of the nobility -there ore 8 Irish
peers and 106 sons of peers. The barristers
number 120, the members of tho army 98,
Lhose in the navy 19. Commerce is represent?
ed by 15 bankers and 136 engaged in other
kinds of business. There are 10 lathers who
have sons sitting with them in the House, 21
pairs of brothers, and 3-broth irs of one family.
-Four men and two women have just been
tried b?fore the Tribunal of Correctional Police
of Paris, on a charge of introducing the Lan?
terne into France. Nearly seven hundred co?
pies of that publication were found at the resi?
dences of two of the accused; tbcre were also
found a petticoat with eight large pockets, by
the aid of whioh one of the females had re?
cently brought from Brussels one hundred and
thirty numbers of the prohibited work, and a
waistcoat, flannel vest and belt; containing in
all twenty-three receptacles, in which one of
the men had imported one hundred and sev?
enty copies. The accused were sentenced to
terms of imprisonment varying from twj to
six months, with the addition of flues.
-Recent proceedings of the North German
Confederation foroe upon lookers-on the con?
viction, whioh is also universally prevalent in
Germany, that the present state of things is
merely provisional, and that it is designedly
auch. At the present moment,, for all intents
and purposes, the twenty-four millions who
make up the mighty kingdom of Prussia are
living a double political life, and ore ruled by
a double government. On the one side there
is the Prussian Parliiment, tho Prussian Min?
istry and tho Prussian bureauoraoy; on the
other side there is the National Parliament,
the Federal Chancellor, and the Federal
Chancellor's office. The individuals who com?
pose those bodies ore very much tbe same.
Four-fifths of the National Pirliament con?
sist of Pi ussiarr representatives; and the Fed?
eral Chancellor and the Prussian Premier are
one and the same person. To judge by pres?
ent appearances, it is to the National Parlia?
ment that the centre of political gravity is
rapidly shifting, and in the Federal Chancel?
lor's offioe that the executive is beginning to
centralize. Bapid strides are being made to?
wards the creation of a federal government,
and the federal government once in existence,
must be looked upon ss the half-way house to
the oreation of the federal sovereign, i. e., to
the assumption by the Crown of Prussia of a
title, be it that of emperor or of king of tho
Germans, which, while investing it with sover?
eign prerogatives over the confederation in its
own right (?ni not. by mere procuration as at
present,) will complote the national structure
of the present edifioe.

Curious Detection of a Criminal.?
Not long ago there occnrred in Prussia one
of those cases of detection of crimo by
scientific means which interest a large and
intelligent class of readers. A quantity of
gold, packed in boxes, was dispatched by a
railway train. On arrival at its destina­
tion it was discovered that the gold had
been 6tolen from some of the boxes, which
were refilled with sand to make up for the
deficient weight. Measures were at once
taken l'or tho discovery of the thief; and,
thai no chance might be lost, Professor
Ehrenberg was requested to make a micro­
scopic examination of the sand. The Pro­
fessor, who is a member of the Academy of
Sciences at Berlin, well known for his re­
searches into minute objects and his com­
parisons of volcanic dust from all parts of
the world, asked that a quantity of sand
from every station by which the train had
passed Bhould be sent to him. Examining
these one after another, he at last came to
a sand which was identical with that found
in the gold boxes. The name of the sta­
tion whence this sand had been collected
was known; inquiries were set on foot at
that station, and among the persons there
employed the thief was detected.

The 'Tiniew"" on the Alabama Trenty.
London, May 13. The Times to-day has an
editorial article on the rejected Alabama treaty,
wherein it is asserted that the Government of
Great Britain, in submitting to an arbitration on
the question at nil, conceded everything that
was originally demanded or expected by the
American people, and everything that it was
possible to concede.

The agricultural report states, regarding
corn, that nnless the close of the season be
very favorable there must be a hundred and
fifty million bushels less than a full crop. Re
garding cotton, it says that there will be a re
dnotion in (he yield from the Carolinas to' Ala­
bama, and a material increase from Mississip?
pi to Texas. Georgia, Florida and South Caro?
lina have suffered most, mainly from drought,
and in a fen localities from rust and the cater?
pillar and boll worm. The estimates make the
increase in Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas,
respectively, ten, twelve and fourteen per cent.
The probabilities at present favor a yield of
two million seven hundred and fifty thousand
bales. The wheat orop is large andthe quality
in tho South decidedly superior.

Nfcw Orleans. Aug. 2, 1808. General S.
Cooper, Alexandria, Virginia Dear Sir: You
will plcnso excuse the liberty which I take in
trespassing upon your valuable time. I have
recently been preparing for the Southern His­
torical Society a paper upon the losses of the
Confederate array, from battle, wounds, and
disease, durinp the civil war 18(11-5. The fol­
lowing general results of mv investigation are
most respectfully submitted to you for exami­
nation and criticism:

Total wounded, prisoners, and dlscnarged In

If it bo fair to assume that the total mortality
of 1803-4 was fully equal to that of 1802, then
the total deaths in the Confederate Army, 1801-5,
was at lea6t 100,000, exclusive of the deaths in
Northern prisons, which would swell the num­
ber to near 185,000; and if the deaths amongst
the discharged for wounds and diseases, and

amongst the sick and wounded on furlough, bo

iduca, tne grana total oi acains in tue vjonicacr­
e Army, during the entire war, did not fall far
et of 200,000.
,ASording to this calculation, the deaths from

uiv -were about turee times as numerous as

'""""Jesulting from the casualties of battle.

o available Confederate force capable of i

active service in the field did not, during the

entire war, exceed six hundred thousand
(600,000) men. Of this number not more than
four hundred thousand (400,000') were enrolled
at any one time; and the Confederate States
never had in the field more than two huudred
thousand (200,000) men capable of bearing arms
at any one time, exclusive of sick, wouuded,
and disabled.
If the preceding calculation be correct, wo
have the following figures, illustrating the
losses of the Confederate armies during the war:
Confederate forces actively engaged, 1861-8... 000,000
Total deaths In C. 8. A 200,000
Losses of C. 8. A. In prisoners. 1861-5, which
may be considered as total losses, on ac­
count of the policy of non-exchange by the
United States ; 200,000
Losses of C. S. A. by discharges, (Usability, and
desertion 100,000
If this calculation, which is given only as an
approximation, be correct, one-third of all the
men actively engaged on the Confederate
side were cither killed outright upon the field or
died of disease aud wounds; another third of
the entire number were captured and held for
an Indefinitejieriod in Northern prisons; and ot
the remaining 400.000 at least one-half were lost
to the service by discharges and desertion.
At the close of the war the available force of
the Confederate States numbered scarcely 100,000
effective men. The resolution, unsurpassed
bravery, and skill with which the Confederate
leaders conducted this contest are shown by the
fact that out of 000,000 men in the field about
500,000 were lost to the service. At the close
of the war the 100,000 Confederates were op­
posed to one million (1,000,000) Federal troops.

As Annie was carrying a baby one day,
Tossing aloft the lump of inanity,
Dear to its father and mother no doubt—
To the rest of the world a mere lump of hu­
manity-
Sam came along and was thinking, may be,
Full as much of Annie as she of the baby.
""Just look at the darling, cried Annie, in a flut­
ter,
Giving its locks round her fingers a twirl;
""If I- was a man I know that I couldn't
Be keeping my hands off a dear liuiegfrh
And Sam gave a wink as if to say ""may be
Of the girls I'd rather hug you than tho baby P
''Now kiss it,"" she cried, though she still hugged
it closer,
""Its mouth's like ihe roses tho honey bee
sips!""
Sam stooped to obey, and, as heads came to­
gether,
There chanced to arise a confusion of lips 1
And as it occurred it might have been, maybe,
That each got a kiss, Sam, Anne, and tfefthaby!
It's hard to tell just what was the matter,
For the babe was the only one innocent there;
And Anne flushed up like a full blown peony,
And Samuel turned red to the roots of his hair;
So the question is this—you can answer it, may­
be—
Did Anne kiss Sam, or did both kiss the baby ?","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024718/1870-03-22/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,vi_lure_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Staunton spectator.,"L.

Though the engagements at Wftisenburg aid
Worth are regarded as minor combats, yet they
are tonality of the highest importance. The

The French soldiers stood their ground well, and
their rifles proved terribly destructive, it was
downright hard lighting which enabled the Oer­

weight of the German
Tbe fight being oae not of
bolk-is, bot of bayonets, also, it was decided «t
last br the actual strength of the respective com­
batants. Phyalcally, the average German soldiers
are heavier men than the French. It was sup­
posed the introduction of new weapons would
alter ibe mode of warfare, and render the old
style of hand-to-hand combat obsolete. This
engagement proved otherwise. The Zouaves did
what they could t« check the advance of the Ger­
man regiment by pourine in a volley of fire from
a concealed position. They had posted them­
selves tn pits deg for the purpose, and not until
the -advancing regiment had sof­
fered from this concealed fire did
German solders know their prowess was to be
contested. They saw no sign of troops In their
front. Such an ordeal as this tested the staff of
which these men are made. They bore themselves
with extraordinary valor. Men were struck down
l<y hundreds, yet the regiment never moved. The
Zouaves were driven from their place of conceal­
ment, and the ground they bad tccnpld was won

Don't Give Up.

A -gentleman, traveling in the
northern part of Ireland, heard the
voices of children, and paused to
listen.
Finding ""the sounds proceeded
from a small building used as a
school house, he drew near; and as
the door was open, he entered, and
listened to the words the boys were
spelling.
One little fellow stood apart, sad
and dispirited.
"" Why does that boy stand there?""
asked the gentleman.
""Oh. he is cood for nothing!"" re-
ulied the teacher. ""There's nothing
in him. I can make nothing of him.
He is the most stupid boy in school.""
The gentleman was surprised at
thi3 answer. He saw that the teacher
was bo stern and rough that the
younger and more timid boys were
nearly crushed. He said a few kind
words to him; then placing his hands
upon the noble brow of the little
fellow who stood apart, he said,
""One of these days you may be a
fine scholar. Don't give up, bnt try,
my. boy, try.""
The soul of the boy was roused,
His dormant intellect awoke. A
new purpose was formed. From
that hour he became studious ana
ambitious to excel. And he did
become a fine schollar, and the
author of a well known comentary
on the Bible; a great and good man,
beloved and honored. It was Dr.
Adam Clark.
The secret of his success is worth
knowing. ""Don't give up, but, try,
my boy try!""","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84028821/1871-05-25/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,ohi_edgar_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Holmes County Republican.,"Laubach, White & Cunningham","Millersburg, Holmes Co., O.

To the Editor of the Bekald:?
I bare been skirting the Texas frontier for the
past month, and here for the first time I meet files
oi Eastern papers, by which I see quite an unneces­
sary muss has been raised by a purported speech
made by me at a supper oi the Union League Club
of New Orleans the night preceding my departure
from that city. Whoever reported that as a speech
by me committed a breach or propriety, for Governor
Warmoth presided, and before 1 consented to re­
spond to a call I was assured by the president or
the society that no reporters were present and that
whatever was said would be saorea and confined to
the persons present. Now as to politics. I think all
t my personal friends know my deep-seated antipathy
to the subject, ret as you seem not to understand
me 1 hereby state, and mean all that I say, that I
NEVER HAVE BEEN AND NEVER WILL BR A CANDIDATE
FOR president; that if nominated bv either

IF UNANIMOUSLY ELECTED I SHOULD DECLINE TO

If yon can find langnagc stronger to convey this

Froa L mlarllle Commercial, Sept. 5.
Yesterday afternoon a gentleman living
in an aristocratic portion cf Second street
set out to search for his wife, who had
been absent frrm home since Saturday.
Going into the row of huts located be­
tween Walnut and Madison and ist and
Floyd streets, he was filled with unuttera­
ble anguish t.t finding her in one of these
dirty huts, occupied only by colored peo­
ple, and evidently very much latoxicated.
All of his efforts to induca her to returu
to her hems and to the six livir.g children
with which iheir marriage has been
blessed were unavailing. The woman cn
treated to be let abne, or else be per­
mitted to go where she would never be­
hold h's face agaiu. She had on her per­
son the sum of three hundred dollars,
whicn she sta'ed would tako her where
she pl ased. A carriage was sent to the
door, and au officer, whose assistance was
required, went into the house and finally
persuaded her to return to the home
which she had not sten, and perhaps had
liot thought of, since Saturday. She was
placed in the carriage, ana, in company
with the offlctr, went back :o
her family, but not without imploring
to bo allowed to ko any where eise. 1 nc
appearance of the woman ib prepos­
sessing in every respec above tho aver­
age size, she is splesdidly formed, and in
affluent circumstances. What motive
there is for this woman's strange and dis­
graceful conduct cannot even bj guessed.
Thi3 add3 yet anotcer horror to tne long
list of crimes from drunkenness. Ileicis
a woman of personal beauty, high posi­
tion a, mother turrcundtd by her chil­
dren dragged down below the level of a
brute, and involving in. her fall husband,
children and loviog friencb. And all for
whall Let who will, answer.

Storing Pota'oes-
T , 1
As tlic time hts arrived for po'a­
tocs the early sorts to be harve'­
ed I wish to s:iy t those who have
them to harvest, to put t'-.cm iu bai
rels as the be-a mode of disposing i.
them. There are those wh have
tried this fir years, and cannot be
persuaded to keep their potatoes in
any other way. Dig and expose to
the air til! dry . then pu u as direc­
ts, taking the barrels to the field
Store in -he cellar, any part most
convenient. The advantage is that
the air is not exposed, ns with open
1uir. which often vitiale'it. and al
ways leave a potato odor. You have
nothing of this. Another advantage :
You can put where most convenient,
and more at pleasure, with little d'fli­
culty, and you may place tier of bar­
rels till up to the floor. When it is
wished to use any, a barrel is opened
and used, and so on with the rest,
leaving no dirt, the ground remain
ing in the barrel. Or. if it is wished
to sell, they arc already put up. An
barrel will do, so that it is strong
enough a salt barrel as good as any.

and a half inches long. How far he had ridden
they did not know; hot after they saw hint, they
watched him until he had ridden all of twenty­

motlonleM as though he was dead, when the
wasp, after a little, would spur him up. and then
the worm would go 00. The wa«p would keep

the worm lay. and then selrlnu the worm by the
head drew it Into the hole, presently the wasp

Selection of Insects for Food by Birds.
Although we look, and with ample
reason, to the birds as the main agency
in destroying insects injurious to vege­
tation, observation shows that difterent
forms of insects are molested by them
in very diflerent degrees. This is
especially the ease in regard to the
Lepidoplera, some forms of which are
not touched by any birds whatever, and
others again are devoured by some and
spared by others. Asa general rule, it
is said that the most beautiful and
brilliantly colored Lepidopetra owt their
safety to their tints, as the bird first at­
tacks the most striking portion, namely
the red hinder wing, and the insect
tears itself away and escapes. Hairy
caterpillars, again, are less eaten than
the smooth species, not only perhaps
on account of their bristly covering,
but their more nauseous taste. The
streaked caterpillars, spotted with yel­
low, are usually refused, while all the
smooth and dark kinds, especially those
resembling planis in color, or of a red
dish tint, are generally devoured with
great r.vidity. Harper's Magazine for

Gold Discovery in Cascade.
A few days ago Mr. E. D. Catlin, of
Coldwater, returned from a visit to Cas­
cade township, Kent county, bringing a
small amount of gold dust of his own
panning out. It was found in the bed
of a small creek, a tributary of the
Thornapple river. The discovery was
made but recently ; the largest particles
yet found were about the size of a pin­
head. Says the Coldwater Republican :
“ The sample left with us was passed to
Dr. G. K. Smith, an old Californian, for
analysis. He pronounces it genuine
gold, mixed with black sand, the latter
being partially composed of sulphurets
of iron, the same as exists in California
in connection with gold. This sample
is of the character of float gold.” Pros­
pecting may develop a sufficiency of the
precious metal to pay the public debt.
Let us hope so.-—East Saginaw Enter­

Hcematosine, the coloring matter of
the blood in man and the superior ani­
mals, is the subject of an interesting
article in the Journal des Connaissances
Medicales, which has just reappeared
in Paris after its suspension during the
siege. Hcematosine is contained within
the blood globules, where it is associated
with a colorless compound called “hco­
matoglobuline.” Hcematosine is pre­
pared as follows: Clotted blood is
kneeded into a paste with the solution
of some harmless coagulating salt, and
is then subjected to a strong pressure.
The cakes thus obtained is taken of the
press broken into crumbs, and digested
with 97 parts alcohol and three parts of
some acid. The hcematosine dissolves
in the the liquid which becomes strong­
ly colored, and the “ globuline” settles
at the bottom of the vessel. The solu­
tion is poured off from the precipitate,
and on being neutralized deposits a
quantity of reddish flakes which are
raw hcematosine. Thai is purified by
successive washings on a filter with wa­
ter, alcohol and ether, and is afterwards
dried and reduced to a powder of a
brown hue and metallic appearance, but
with neither taste nor smell. Hoematos­
ine is insoluble in water and alcohol,
hut can be dissolved in ether, all the
essential oils and fatty bodies. After
calcinating, a residuum of protoxide of
iron is obtained. According to many
physiologists this is the form in which
is contained in the blood, although Ger­
man chemists think it exhists there in
its natural state. Hcematosine, however,
is administered in the shape of pills and
lozenges in cases where iron is recom­
mended, it being more easily absorbed
by the stomach in conjunction with
food.
The Girl of the Period an Old-Fash­
ioned Girl.—ln 1647, the “Simple Cob­
bler of Agawam” wrote in Massachu­
setts as follows of the ladies’ dresses of
that period: “ I can make myself sick
at the time with comparing the dazzling
splendor wherewith our gentlewomen
were embellished in some former habits
with the goose-down wherewith they
are now surcingled and debauched.
We have about five or six of them in
our colony. If I meet any of them ac­
cidentally, I can not cleanse ray phansie
of them for a month after. It is enough
to break the heart for to see our goodly
women imprisoned in French cages,
peering out of their hood-holes (big
bonnets) for some men of mercy to help
them with a little wit, and nobody to
relieve them. It is no marvel they
wear diailes on the hinder part of their
heads, leaving nothing, as it seems, in
the fore part but a few squirrel’s brains
to help them frisk from one ill-fi yored
fashion to another. It is no little labor
to be continually putting up English
women into outlandish casks ; who, if
they be net shifted anew once in a few
months, grew sour for their husbands.
When I hear a gentle dame inquire
what is the newest fashion of the court,
with desire to be in it with all haste,
whatever it be, I look at her as the very
gizzard of a trifle, the product of a
quarter of a cypher—the epitome of
nothing !
An anecdote of Lord Chief Justice
Holt is as foliows : A poor woman was
arraigned for witchcraft. The witness
deposed that she used a “ spell.” The
“spell”—produced in evidence—was a
line from one of the classic poets, writ­
ten on parchment. The Justice de­
manded to see it, and it was handed to
him. “How came you by this?” he
asked the prisoner. “ A young gentle­
man, my Lord, gave it to me to cure
my daughter’s ague.” “ Did it cure
her ?” “ 0 yes, my Lord, and many
others.” “ l am glad of it,” said the
Justice. “Gentlemen of the jury, when
I was young and thoughtless, I went to
this woman’s house with some compan­
ions, had no money to pay the reckon­
ing, and pretended that by a ‘ spell ’ I
could cure her daughter’s ague. She
accepted the proposition, and let us off
scot free. If any one is punishable it
is the Lord Chief Justice, and not this
poor woman.” Of course she was a­
quitted, but the credulous multitude af­
firmed that the judge and jury were all
bribed.
A cynical man says the reason wo­
men are so fond of writing letters is
that they rejoice in the opportunity of
saying all they wish without the possi­
bility of an interruption.

A gambler informed the Detroit
Folice Court, the other day, as to a cer­
tain difference in the names applied to
the lairs of the tiger. “Is the place in
question known as a common gambling
house?” inquired the Judge, and the
votary of chance explained: “ No; it
is what gamblers call a ‘ snap’ room ;
but I don’t s’pose you know what that
means, so I’ll explain. A * snap’ room
is a place where any gambler can take a
man and deal faro, on condition of pay­
ing the proprietor ten per cent, of the
winnings.” 
A correspondent of the Providence
Journal attempts to show the origin of
the cant phrase “put a head on him.”
In 1863, he says, he was corporal of the
first relief on a certain cavalry picket,
and in posting his men heard from the
corporal of the relief then on post a
queer story, to the effect that the senti­
nel on one of the posts, wdiich happen­
ed to be near an old grave, had been
horribly perturbed by the appearance
before him in the dead hour of night of
a man on horseback without a head.
To Jones, the man whom the Journal's
corporal correspondent was to station at
this post, the tale was duly told, and
then the correspondent added : “Look
out for the man on horseback without
any head on !” Jones was just firing
up his “ brier-wood” for company, and
replied between whiffs: “Well (puff),
if a man (puff) puff) on horseback
back (puff'), without any head on (puff)
comes around me (puff) puff, puff’), I’ll
put a head on him !”
'['he extent to which labor-saving ma­
chines have been introduced into agri­
culture, says the Chicago Tribune, we saw
illustrated a day or two ago in Wiscon­
sin. A farmer was seated on a reaper,
with gloves on his bands, and with an
umbrella over him, and, with as much
comfort as if driving a buggy, he was
cutting oats, the rraper throwing them
into regular and convenient sheaves for
binding and stacking. We remember
the time when, twenty ye,rs ago, we cut
oats without an umbrella or gloves, and
let the grain lay where it fell from the
scythe. Yet here was a man with a pair
of horses, in comparative comfort, do­
ing more in one day than twenty-five
men could have done by hand twenty
years ago.
A Chinese “ Bender.”—A correspon­
dent who recently visited the Chinese
shoemakers at North Adams, Mass.,
writes : “ I learned one thing that I do
not remember to have seen in print,
that they are strictly temperate except
on the Ist of January, when they have
a grand drunk. Last January they
were given four days for a spree of this
sort, and they went through it with
magnificent system and success. I
omitted to inquire what their favorite
beverage is, but somebody should find
it out; for after getting drunk and
keeping so four days, they come out re­
freshed and invigorated. There is no
joke about this, for the proprietor said
that on the day following their enor­
mous ‘bum' in -Jauuary they did a larger
day’s work than before or since on a
single day. 
The account of some of the principal
female poisoners who have attained no­
toriety during the present century,which
is published, is curiously supplemented
by a dispatch, narrating the crimes of a
Miss Edmonds, at Brighton, in Eng
land. It seems that she first attempted
to take the life of a woman with whose
husband she had fallen in love, by the
use of poisoned chocolate creams. The
attempt was not successful. Then, for
the purpose, it is said, of covering up
her former crime, she distributed the
poisoned confections throughout the
city, with serious results. Surely me­
diaeval history is repeating itself about
this time in a most unpleasant manner.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033019/1871-09-22/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,whi_flobberworm_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Dodgeville chronicle.,Wrigglesworth & Co.,"Dodgeville, Wis.","","",13757,3326,7328,25470,1,22473,30060,0,whi_flobberworm_ver01/data/sn85033019/00414215531/1871092201/0150.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dodgeville%2C_Wisconsin,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/whi_flobberworm_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85033019%2F00414215531%2F1871092201%2F0150.jp2/pct:61.215681,11.064538,32.608019,84.730539/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/whi_flobberworm_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85033019%2F00414215531%2F1871092201%2F0150.jp2/pct:61.215681,11.064538,32.608019,84.730539/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

All, there he comes.”
The carriage she had sent to Sleaford to
meet her brother, was in tael at that moment
seen returning at a swilt pace along the dusty
road. It turned in at the wide farm gates
and came up the carriage sweep toward the
porch. Miss Kedrulh arose altera mechani­
cal fashion from her chair, ai d went slowly
out inui the wide hall, advancing to the
threshold to meet her relative.
The o.eu caniago came nearer. Cpou the

at sight of her, and who took off his hat as a
sudden rush ot emotion swept over his soul.

obe withdrew herself from his arm, and led
him into the low, quaint, pleasant drawing
room.
The Colonel halted just within the thresh­
old, nd looked about the room with an eager,
expectant gaze.
He was a handsome, distinguished looking
man, of some Bl'iy years, with a complexion
deeply bronzed by Indian suns, with keen,
dark ejes, a grand head, and black hair al­
ready sineaked with gray. He wore iron-gray
military whiskers, and his massive eyebrows,
weie oi iron-gray, also, giving to his noble
countenancea lookot sternness and command
that well became him.
“Wuere is Ignatia?” he asked, his face sud­
denly clouded with disappointment. “Wliy is
not illt cnild here to welcome her father?
She—she is not ill?”
“Xo, George,” answered Miss Kedrulh, with
embairassmeut. “Sire does not know that
you are expected to day. I thought it best
not to tell lier, and—and 1 sent her out in her
little pony chaise lor a drive.”
“Intending to let her find me here on her
return?’ said the Colonel, his brow clearing.
“You meant Vo surprise her? Will she be
back soon?”
“Sit down. George,” said Miss Redruth,
with peioeptible uneasiness. “1 have some­
thing to tell you before Ignatia comes. Hid—
did you hear anything over at rleaford? Hid
you meet any one you used to know ?”
“l did not,” said the Colonel wonderingly,
seatiug himself at a window commanding a
view of the road. “Was there anything for
mo to beat ?” he added with a sudden change
ot coun er.ance. “The child has not grown
de'onned, nor had the small pox, nor—”
“How old do you think the child is?” de­
manded M'ss Redruth grimly. “You left her
a little girl, and she seems hut a liilie girl to
you still. Rut she is twentv t ears old. a wo­

man grown—77
“Ah, yes,"" sighed the Colonel. She has
left behind her her childhood, but she will be
something nearer and dearer to me thau sim­
ply a child. She will be my companion, my
lriend. Sbe will console me in part lor the
loss ot her mother. Does she lultill her child­
ish promise of beauty aud grace?""
“She dues,” said Miss Kedruth, setting her
lips together.
“1 know ibat she is good,” said the Indian
soldier, with tender emphasis. “I remember
well her loving, sensitive nature, her winning
ways, he; bright, impetuous spirit. &She bad
# no.eie intellect—you do not mean, Jacob,
that sbe is not so clear-beaded as she was?’’
he added, in sudden alarm.
“No, she knows enough,” was the icluclant
reply.
“Ah,” said the Colonel trying to smile.
“She has a lover then ? That is to he expected
at her age.”
“You should have come home sooner,
George,” said Miss Redruth. “People who
have children should slay with them and take
care of them.”
“I could not well come home earlier, Ja­
cob,” said the Colonel. “My daughter is an
heiress, and as such must take her place in
society, ll she has an unworthy lover, I wili
undertake to wean her hear! Irom him. Sure­
ly sbe cannot resist her lather’s loving coun­
sels.”
“It is too late for counsels,” said Miss Red­
ruth, with a sort of grim desperation, “lg.
natia Redruth is beyond the reach of advice.
You need not blame me, George. Ignatia her­
sell vill clear my skirts of Ioann-. It is no*
mv fault if she has wrecked your hopes, and
made herself a bed ot living coals lo lie on.”
The Colonel’s lace giew suddenly pale.
The grizzled mustache on hts upper lip trem­
bled couvulsively.
""What has she done?” he asked, in a
hoarse whisper.
""Married a dissolute fellow—”
“Manied? Good Heaveus!”

She has been married nearly four

“Four years? And you never told me?
She never wrote that she wss married. Four

“'fes. Let me tell you how It happened.
Abouc tour years ago, a regiment was station­
ed within twenty miles ot us, and its officers
were to be met at all the best houses in this

xiatia had a number of girl friends, wiiom she

the phrase is. He comes of a good family,
but is dissolute. His own lather has disown­
ed him. He is thoroughly ban, hut has a spe­
cious appearance. He fed in love with Igua­
tia and she with him, and one day the pre­
cious pair came into this very room and ask­
ed my consent to their marriage.”
‘’Well f” said the Colonel, ids face ghastly
white, his voice trembling.

Redruth. “I gent lanatia to her school room,

The new postal card will be made from dies
cut in hardened steel for surface printing, a
novel and heretofore considered impossible
mode of engraving. The lines instead of be­
ing sunk are raised like those of sn ordinary
wood cut, so that the plate may be used io
the same manner as type in any printing
press. The completed card is three inches
by five and one-eighth inches in size, made
from a fine qualitg of card board, and is of a.
light buff color. A border of scroll work
runs around the edge, while in the upper
, right hand corner is a very handsome stamp,
consisting of a head of liberty encircled with
stars and surrounded by eliptical scroll work.
The denomination is one cent, and Jhe color
of the work is of a rich velvet bro n. The
inscription is simply “United States postal
card—write address only on this side, the
message on the other.” Below are ruled
lines, while the reverse is blank.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014248/1872-10-08/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,me_dyerbrook_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Daily Kennebec journal.,"Sprague, Owen & Nash","Augusta, Me.","","",17868,2244,2777,3085,3,21908,28040,0,me_dyerbrook_ver01/data/sn82014248/00332895187/1872100801/1074.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augusta%2C_Maine,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/me_dyerbrook_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82014248%2F00332895187%2F1872100801%2F1074.jp2/pct:81.559248,8.002853,12.675735,11.002140/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/me_dyerbrook_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82014248%2F00332895187%2F1872100801%2F1074.jp2/pct:81.559248,8.002853,12.675735,11.002140/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

The principal importance uv a mister)· iz
the mistery itself—what makes a ghost so re­
gpecktable a karakter iz that nobody ever

It iz the surp izes uv life after all that give

A WIDOW FOOLED HIM.
A liberal education, a handsome per­
son, and a wealthy and indulgent fath­
er were among the agreeable things
that were vouchsafed Robert Anson by
smiling fortune. His mother had died
in his early youth, and the father and
son—the only members of the family
left—had afterward been more like
brothers in their relations towards each
other. They had made a European
tour, and had traversed every nook
and corner of ximerica together, seek­
ing in rational amusement the legiti­
mate enjoyment of a colossal fortune.
Bat at last there came an amicable
separation of a year. Anson desired
to again visit Europe, and his father
preferred a trip across the continent
to the Pacific coast; therefore each
went his way, followed by the good
wishes of the other.
Mr. Anson, senior, spent six months
on the plains and in California; and
made a discovery on the return trip.—
Stopping for a few days in Chicago, he
accidentally learned of the existence
of a distant relative of his deceased
wife’s—a girl whose parents had not
long before died, leaving the daughter
dependent upon her own exertions for
support. Mr. Anson sought her out,
finding in Flora Mightmay a pretty, in­
telligent girl of eighteen, holding a po­
sition as teacher in one of the public
schools. He was charmed with her,
and at once offered a home.
‘‘But I should dislike to be a bur­
den to anybody,” interposed the inde­
pendent young lady.
“The obligation would be on the
other side,” replied Mr. Anson: “I
am rich, and have only one relative—
a son who is in Europe. He will be
home soon. Both of us have had our
fill of traveling, and will want to set­
tle down in a home. By making your i
home with ns ton will add to it a so-(|
ciai aLll'aCliwC""x(|jlie ve a""
bachelor’s hall,,and we’ll all be as hap­
py as larks together.”
The outlook was certainly alluring
to the lonely orphan, and she accepted
the offer, returning to New York with
Mr. Anson.
Thereupon the old mansion was ren­
ovated, refurnished, and soon became
the headquarters of a brilliant social
clique. Flora at once took her place
as a favorite, and Mr. Anson was proud
of his pretty protege.
As the return of Robert Anson was
how daily expected, it may be well to
follow him on his transatlantic voyage.
He had barely embarked at Liverpool
before his eyes fell upon the form of a
decidedly handsome and dashing wo­
man. A widow—anybody could have
told that by her dash of manner and
her air of independence. Not much
past thirty, and at the zenith of her
charms, she was a really bewidering
creature. So Robert thought at first
sight, and so he found her upon ac­
quaintance. A Mrs. Morrow she prov­
to be, and she was alone and unpro­
tected on her voyage, which had been
made to visit some distant relatives in
England. The steamer consumed nine
days in its passage. On the first Rob­
ert managed to gain a speaking ac­
quaintance. On the second he had
improved it so far as to be on easy chat­
ting terms, and before the close of the
third he was enslaved. They walked
the decks by the moonlight on the
fourth and fifth, and before the sev­
enth their billing and cooing had at­
tracted attention of the passengers.
On the eighth Robert proposed and was
accepted, and on the ninth they reach­
ed New York,
Mrs. Morrow owned a little house in
Brooklyn, and had a modest income
from property left by her husband.—
To her home Robert saw her safely
conveyed, and then sought his own.—
The changes there astonished him, for
his father had kept it all as an agreea­
ble surprise. 1
“Robert,” said Mr. Anson, as he wel­
comed him, “do you recognize the din­
gy old house?”
“Scarcely, father,” was the reply;
“everything is new, bright and cheer­
ful. What does it mean ?”
“A woman.”
“Married?”
“No, no; hut hush! There conies
the cause Of it all. Clara, this is my
son Robert.”
Possibly the wido"" had she seen the

Port Holmco fcimes.

impression that Clara produced on her
lover, would have felt less secure in
her conquest. For Clara had improv­
ed in spirits since her residence with
Mr. Anson, and was even prettier than
when she first came there.
That night, over a social bottle of
wine, the father explained to his son
the manner in which he had found
Clara, and the light and happiness
that she had brought to their home.
“And I have formed a plan in refer­
ence to her,” concluded Mr. Anson.
“What is it?” asked Robert.
“You shall marry her.”
“Impossible.”
“Why ?”
Thus brought to the point, Robert
confessed his engagement to Mr. Mor­
row.
“How old is she ?” asked Mr. Anson.
“Thirty.”
“And you are twenty-six—how ab­
surd ? People will laugh at you. Cla­
ra is young, pretty, and I know she
will love you.”
“But I love the widow.”
“Nonsense.”
“Father!”
“There, my boy, don’t take offense.
I only mean that you have mistaken
admiration for love. That you really
love a woman four years your senior,
and a widow at that, is absurd. You
think you do, but you don’t. Now
I’ll tell you what I’ll do. Not anoth­
er word shall be said on the subject for
one month. At the end of that time if
you persist in marrying Mrs. Morrow,
I shall marry Clara myself.”
“I agree,” replied Robert.
The month passed quickly, and at
its close the situation was about like
this: Robert was fenced between love
for Clara and his duty to..the widow;
Clara was deeply in love with Robert;
Mrs. Morrow was troubled by a certain
falling-off in her lover’s ardor; and
Mr. Anson, who had steadly refused to
see the widow, hoped for the best for
his plan. The father and son met af­
fter supper.
month is up. What have you decided
upon doing?”
“We have always made confidants of
each other,” began Robert.
“Certainly.”
“And I will not hide anything from
yon now. I love Clara, and believe she
loves me; but I am engaged to Mrs.
Morrow, and can not honorably break
the engagement.”
“Then leave the matter entirely to
me.”
“What will you do?”
“I will secure your release by the
widow.”
“By fair means ?”
“By her free consent.”
And so the interview closed.
On the following day Mr. Anson
sought the home of the widow. She
was in, and upon learning who he was
welcomed him cordially. She asked
him to be seated on the sofa, upon
which she also gracefully san£. Mr.
Anson had made up his mind to be
brief and business-like; but the gorge­
ous widow quite upset him before he
had even broached the subject of his
son’s engagement. They came to speak
of him naturally at last, however, and
the widower saw his opportunity.
“You love ray son?” he began.
“What a question, Mr. Anson,” she
replied, showing her perfect teeth in a
bewitching smile; “am I not going to
marry him?”
“I hope not.”
“Sir,” and even the widow’s pretty
frown captivated him.
“I beg your pardon,” he added, crest­
fallen, “I mean that I came to .talk the
matter over with you. Do you think
the match is altogether a good one?”
“I see,” and her eyes dropped ap­
propriately, “you object because I am
comparatively poor.”
“Indeed Ido not. The financial as­
pect of the” affair has never been con­
sidered by me.”
The widow here pierced him with a
(look of gratitude.
“It was the difference in, in—” he
stammered.
“In social position?” suggested the
widow. “No—no—”
“Ah! I see—you mean in age?”
“Yes,” he replied sheepishly, “you
have divined the reason, and I will be
perfectly fraAk with you. My son is
very dear to me, and it has been the
dream of my life to see him happily
married to some beautiful and loving
i woman.”

FORT TOBACCO. MAJRIi LAJNTT MAY cS. IR7R.

Here the widow turned her glorious
eyes full upon Mr. Anson, and manag­
ed to show her arm, which happened
to be encased in a loose sleeve. It was
a particularly round, smooth arm, and
as white as possible.
“I beg your pardon,” hastily contin­
ued Mr. Anson, “I know that you are
good, beautiful and loveable, but—”
“But lum too old—l am thirty.—
Not so very old either, although I do
feel older than Robert. My love for
him has been largely of the guardian
sort—l have petted and admired him
as a mother might. And he loves
me—”
“But not exactly as he should a wife.
He loves another woman—not a hand­
somer or a better one, my dear madam
—but one younger and better suited to
be his wife.”
The widow btffsfc'into tears—pre­
sumably, at least, as she. hurried her
eyes in her handkerchief, and her
bosom rose and fell tumultuously.—
The widower’s courage quite forsook
him at tfils><to him, unexpected crisis.
A pretty is a malting

“Please don’t cry,” he said; “I have

Here Mi\ Morrow wept afresh, and
her head svik upon the widower’s
shoulder. L%r form shook convul­
sively, and heput his arm around her
waist to suppotfj her.
“My dear mad\m,” he said, “I can­
not find it in my xeart to take Robert
from you.”
“Robert,” she sobed, “I shall never
see him again. I hate nothing left to
desire, except your respect and esteem.
Without those I should indeed be un­
happy.”
Mr. Anson drew her closer to him—
so close that she lay trembling on bis
breast, and pressed a kiss on her fore­
head,
“You have both,” he said, “and my
deepest admiration.” ' - 
“Then I am content. Lefc/Robert

Mr. Anson promised, as he bade the
widow adieu at the door, to call again
soon. And he kept his promise so well
that the next evening found him there
again.
“Victory I” murmured the widow, as
she heard him enter the hall; “he will
propose to me before h£ leaves to-night.
Robert is a very pretty fellow, but he
is inconstant. The father is hand­
some, infatuated with me already, ancl
the money is all his. I prefer the fath­
er.”
She proved reliable in her predic­
tion. Before her caller had kissed her
good night he had offered her his hand,
heart and fortune, and she had accept­
ed all three.
The result was a double wedding,
and subsequent happiness for all con­
cerned. Mr. Anson was a devoted
husband, and Mrs. Morrow made him
a faithful and affectionate wife; while
both parentally watched over the
younger couple. Although so clever­
ly fooled by the widow, Mr. Anson
never suspected it, air1 never had cause

There can be no doubt but that top
dressing grasB lands in winter with line
stall manure, or rich compost, is an
economical process. What the manure
loses in ammonia is made up in mulch­
ing, and if the manure is first fermented
the waste may be even greater. Prof.
Voelcker says that the ammonia of ma­
nure is generally one-half lost to tho
growing crops. But tho soluble matter
washed into tho roots of the grass must
certainly be saved.

Northern PmIIc liai I road Affairs.
Samuel Wllkerson, Secretary of the
Northern Pacltlo Railroad Company,
speaking of the suspension of Jay
Cooke & Co.. Its financial agents, said
he had no doubt of the future of the
road but that It would be constructed ;
that there were those supporting It
who would not allow the work to be
abandoned. The Board of Directors
alone· represented Williams. The
company had not a dollar of unpaid
paper up to the present time ; not a
note of theirs was ever «eon In Wall
Street ; not a bond was hypothecated
by tho company; and consequently
the company had no liabilities hang­
ing over it that might descend with­
out warping. The interest on the
company's bonds wna not due until
tho 1st of January next, and that
then it would undoubtedly be
met. That portion of the road
already built was earning more than
was anticipated. That portion run­

ready developed κ flue carrying trade.
He believed the road would be hin­
dered more by hostile Sioux than by s
financial revolution. Another force,
however, could prevent the successful
completion of the road. Two of the
member* of the Arm were directors oj
the Northern Paciflc Railroad Com­
pany. The result will be that the
work of construction will bo somewhat
retarded. It U more than probable
that Congress will be asked to grant
an extension of years to the company
beyond that already granted, to ena­
ble U to complete the road. No such
enterprise whs ever before attempted
by private capitalists as that ot con­
structing a railroad, '2,200 milos in
length, aoross α continent. Congress
should have come to their aid by ex­
tending the credit of the Government
to the undertaking. It would have
done so, but for tho charge generally,
that corporations wore grasping the
entire domain and overriding the peo­
ple.

FOURTH GIFT CONCERT
OF
PUBLIC LIBRARY OF KENTUCKY.
A CARD TO THE PUBLIC.
The Trustees of the Public Library of Ken­
tucky, andthcManagementof the Gift Concert,
announce the postponement of tho Fourth Gift
Concert until Tuesday, the 31st of March next.
The public will readily understand the causes
which, have made this postponement necessary.
The Jlancial panic, which has for tho last two
months paralyzed the business of every section
of this country and of Europe, has prevented
thousands from investing in tickets. The epi­
demics pervading almost the entire South have
put off a large and available market. And, too!
the public judging from tho effects of these
causes, have expected n postponement and have
declined to invest without a more positive as­
surance of the drawing taking place on a fixed
day.
All interested desire a ""full drawing, but for
the reasons just stated this could not be had on
the 3d of December, but the short postponement
now announced will secure it.
The management have met with unprecedent­
ed success. The sales of tickets, the proceeds of
which have already been received ampunt to
ovKit a million iollars, with a number of
agencies in tliis country yet to hear from, and
all those in Europe.
Thus a drawing (scaling the gifts one-half)
could be had now, but the management deem it
best to have a postponement and a full drawing.
This postponement atturct the tale of all the
tickets and A FULL DRAWING. That tills de­
termination will meet the approbation of nearly
every one interested is made apparent by tho
very numerous letters received from every sec­
tion of this country and the Canadas, asking for
a postponement.
This action of the management will work no
detrinient to any, but will be for the good of all.
By it the fortunate ticket-holders will receive
their gifts in full, while it will nof affept those
who do not draw gifts,
InTnaking tUis announcement, the manage?
ment emphatically ttate that there will be no fur­
ther postponement, and to this end all agents will
bo Imperatively required to close up and trans­
mit their accounts to this ofllce by the 21st of
March. THOS. E. BRAMLETTE,

Nioholas the First was very fond of
masquerade balls, and one night ap­
peared at one in the character of the
devil, with grinning face, horns, and
tail, and appeared to enjoy his charac­
ter very much. About three o'clock in
the morning he went out, and throwing
over him some furs, called a coachman,
and ordered him to take him to the
Quay Anglais. As it was very cold he
fell asleep, and when he awoke he found
the man had taken him in a wrong di­
rection, for the Quay Anglais is one of
the most elegant portions of St. Peters­
burg, while before him were only some
miserable houses. Nicholas began to re­
monstrate, but the coachman paid no
heed to him, and presently passing
through a stone gateway, brought him
into a cemetery, and taking a large
knife from his girdle, and pointing it at
his employer's throat, said : ""Give me
your money and your furs, or I will kill
you.""
""And do you give me your soul,"" ex­
claimed Nicholas as he threw off the furs
and disclosed bis personification of the
devil.
The Russians are very superstitious,
and the coachman was so terrified he
fell senseless on the ground, and the
emperor drove himself back to his pal­
ace.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026259/1874-01-29/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,pst_deike_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Elk County advocate.,C.B.

trinl, scientific!, agricultural and other as­
sociations, in their districts.

mittees, representing the different indus­
tries of their districts.

the industries of the country.
5. To encourage the production of artioles
suitable for exhibition.
6. To distribute documents issued by the
Commission among the manufacturers
and others in their districts interested in
the exhibition,
7. To render assistance in furthering the
financial and other interests of the exhi­
bition, and to furnish information to the

buildings or grounds must be made on the
printed form (No. 63), in accordance with

hibited, and a complete representation of
the resources and industries of the country.
To tliis end, there should be presented for
exhibition the best products of each dis­
trict, and especially those which are re­
garded as of a representative character,","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014896/1874-09-26/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,az_joshuatree_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Arizona citizen.,J.

The London Telegraph says: ""Fortunately, or
unfortunately, It seems not at all impossible that
a genuine sealskin jacket will before long be
almost aa impossible an article of the ordinary
feminine toilette as a string or brilliants itseir.
Some thirty years ago sealskin was common
enough. Boxes were covered with it gloves and
driving rugs were made of lt costermongers and
cabmen cut their caps from lt Theneameatlme
when tome cunning lunier discovered hew to dye
lt a rich dark brown, and to give lt that exquis­
itely soft and downy texture which is its chief
charm. At once ladles adopted the luxury. It
was soon round that for cloaks. Jackets, muffs,
dainty little hats, collars, cuffs, bags, portemon­
nales, for a thousand other articles of feminine
use, lt was the most delightful, the most beautiful,
the most Indispensable oi all possible materials.
The demand for lt Increased with a rapidity
almost marvelous, and the fashion, Instead ot
wearing Itself nut, has, if anything, steadily in­
creased. Indeed, the best Alaska sealsklnsUko
the furs of the table, the silver fox and the Rus­
sian sea otter, command an altogether fancy
price, and a handsome Jacket of close texture
and uniform color, with no white hairs to break
the continuity of Its tint, will fetch as many
guineas as five and twenty years ago lt would
have retched half-crowns. The result Is that the
luckless seals have had waged against them now
for several years what practically amounts to a
war of extermination.""","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86053573/1874-12-29/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,dlc_eastern_ver01,"","","",true,ca,National Republican.,W.J.

HOUSEHOLD HINTS.

Whe a cork gets pushed dowa iato

strong twine and engage the cork in
any direction most convenient. Then
give a strong pull, and the cork will gen­
erally yield sufficiently to be withdrawn.

To CLEXS and restore the elasticity of
cane chair-bottoms: Turp the chair
bottom upward, and with hot water and
a sponge wash the cane work weil, so
i that it is well soaked should it be dirty,
use soap let it dry in the air and it will
be as tight and firm as new, provided
none of the canes are broken.

A Delicious PrBDrNO.—Half a pound
of flour, half a pound of sugar, half a
pound of butter, half a pound each ot
raisins, currants, and citron, a nutmeg,
and a small pinch of mace. Add four
eggs, whisked for at least half an hour.
Put the pudding in a well-flcured cloth
that has also been scalded and boiled
for three hours. Send to taole with
sauce.

Is case a finger-ring becomes too tight
to pass the joint of the finger, the finger
should first be held in cold water to re­
duce any swelling or inflammation.
Then wrap a rag soaked in hot water
around the ring to expand the metal,
and lastly soap the finger. A needle
threaded with strong silk can then be
passed between the ring and finger, and
a person holding the two ends and
pulling the silk, while sliding it around
the periphery of the ring, will readily re­
move the latter. Another method is to
pass a piece of sewing silk under the
ring, and wind the thread in pretty close
spirals and closely around the finger to
the end—that below the ring—and begin
unwinding.—Scientific American.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84038485/1875-04-15/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,iahi_electabuzz_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Toledo chronicle.,M.B.C.

However, Colvin, or Colvin's double,

I'OnVUIPTIOJi OF FORESTS.
It it rail that nearly ono half of the
surplus hard woods in the country are
to lie fonnd in Western Virginia. How
long these will last ia a doubtful ques­
tion. Taking the ono item of railroad
tie-, and Wo find that the country re­
quires for its annual supply 94,530,000
cubic feet, equal to 738,515 cords of solid
timber, to secure which at least 2,000,000
cords of standing timber have to be cut
down. The nrerago product per acre of
the forests of Virginia is given by M. F.
Maury at from 40 to 50 cords per acre ;
1.0 that, taking the maximum yield, our
railroad tics alone destroy annually 40,­
000 acres of woodland. Tho annual con­
sumption of the country for fuel is esti­
mated at over 50,000,000 cords of wood,
of which tlireo-fifths may be assumed to
b» good standing timber cut expressly
for fuel. This gives an annual clearing
of COO.uOO acn-s. The iron foundries con­
sumed in 1870 035,000 tons of charcoal,
and a furnace that makes six or seven
tons of iron a day wilt use up 200 acres
of woodlsnd in a year. The annual pro­
duct of charcoal iron is now about 200,­
ooo torn, using up 5,000 acres a year.
Tho pine lands of Michigan, the best in
the country, yield 10,000 feet to the acre,
board measure. The annual consump­
tion of the 'ount ry in manufactured
lumber is 20,000,000,000 feet, represent­
ing an annual clearing of 2,000,000 acres.
The fenc rg of the country required 25,­
000,000 a re leared in order to make it,
d the annual repairs to fencing destroy
2.500.000 nrres of forest. Uur shipping
tonnage represents 80,000 acres of oak
forest d troyed, and demands for re­
pairs 4,000 acres a year. Tho hard and
turned wood manufactures of the coun­
try use up an annual average of 300,000
acres of timber. Taking all these items
together. • -have an aggregate annual
consumption of 5,500,000 acres of forest.
As our total forest lands amount to 380,­
000,<Jv0, they will last at this rate only
seventy years. A certain per eentage of
orest destroyed is allowed to renew it­
self, and, •; in seventy years a pine
■roods can be cut over twice, this renew­
• al amounts to a very considerable figure,
but it is scarcely sufficient to offset the
increasing demand for timber for every
purpose to keep pace with increasing
population and exigent industries in the
same period. In other words, our pres­
ent system of husbandry and our pres­
ent growth of population, seventy years
marks the maximum period that our
tor : t- may be exiiected to hold out.

The act of Congress which provided for ""cele­
brating the one hundredth anniversary or Ameri­
can Independence, by holding an international
exhibition of arts, manufactures and products of
the soil and mine,"" authorized the creation of
the United States Centennial Commission, and
Intrusted to it tha management of the Exhibi­
tion. This body Is composed of two commissioners
from each State and Territory, nominated by tha
respective Governors, and commissioned by the
President of the United States. The enterprise,
therefore, Is distinctly a national one, and not, as
has sometimes been stated, the worker a prlvato
corporation.
The Exhibition will be opened on May 10, 1875,
and remain open every day, except Sunday, until
November 10. There will be a fixed price or fifty
cents ror admission to all the buildings and
grounds.
The Centennial grounds are situated on the
western bank or the Schuylkill river,' and within
Falrmount Park, the largest cublta park In
proximity to a great city In the world, and on of
the most beautiful In the country. The park con­
tains 3,160 acres, 450 of which hare been Inclosed
for tha Exhibition. Besides this tract there will
be large yards near by for the exhibition or stock,
and a larm or 42 acres has already been suitably
planted ror tbe tests or plows, mowers, reapers
and other agricultural machinery.
The Exhibition buildings are approached by
eight lines or streetcars, which connect with all
the other lrnes In tha dty.and By the Pennsylva­
nia and Eeadlngrliroad,oTer the tracks of whicn
trains will also run from the North Pennsylvania
and Philadelphia,"" Wilmington and Baltimore
railroads. -Thus the Exhibition Is tn Immediate
connection with the entire railroad system ot the)
country, and any one within 90 miles ot Philadel­
phia can visit it at no greater cost than that of
carriage-hire at the Paris or Vienna Exhibition.
The articles to bo exhibited have been classified
tn seven departments.wbleh ror the most part will
be located In appropriate buUdIngs,whose several
areas are as follows:

This provides nearly ten more acres for exhibit­
ing space than tbere were at Vienna, tbe largest
International Exhibition yet held. Yet tha ap-
?ilicatlons of exhibitors bare been sa.nameroas as
a exhaust the space, and many Important classes
of objects must bo provided .for .la special build­
ings. '
An Important special exhibition will be mado
by the United States Government, and is being
prepared nnder the supervision of a board of offi­
cers representing the several Exeentlve Depart­
ments or the Government. A floe bulldlnz of
fonr and one hair acres Is provided for the pur­
pose, space In which will be occupied by tbe war.
Treasury. Nary, Interior, Post Office and Agri­
cultural Departments and the Smithsonian Insti­
tution.The Women's Centennial Executlre Commit­
tee hare raised (30,000 for the erection ora pavil­
ion In which to exhibit every kind or women's
work. To this collection women or all nations are
expected to contribute.
Tha list ol special buildings Is constantly in­
creasing, and present Indications are that their
total cumber will be lrom 200 to 250. Most ot the
Important foreign nations England, Germaay,
Austria, France, Sweden, Egypt, Japan and
others are putting up one or more structures
each for exhibiting purposes, or for the use of the
commissioners, exhibitors and Till tors. Offices
and headquarters of this kind, usually or consid­
erable architectural beauty, are provided by the
States or Pennsylvania, Ohio. Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, New Jerser, New York, Connecticut,
Massachusetts. New Hampshire, Missouri, Kan­
sas, Virginia, West Virginia, Nevada, Wisconsin.
Iowa and Delaware, and It ts likely that others
will follow the example.
A number of trad and Industrial associations,
which require large amounts of space, will be
provided for in special buildings. Among these
are the photographers, tha carriage builders,
the glass makers, the cracker bakers, the boot
and and? shoe manufacturers, besides quite a num­
ber of Individual exhibitors. The great demand
for space will probably render this course neces­
sary to a considerable extent, especially for ex­
hibitors who have been tardy in making their
applications. In the main exhibition building,
for example. 333,300 square feet of space bad been
applied for by the beglnningof October of Ameri­
can exhibitors only; whereas tbeaggiegata space
which It has been possible to reserve ror the
United States department Is only 160,003 square
feet, about ona third of which will be consumed
by passage ways.
The machinery building. Ilka the others. Is
already fully covered by applications. There are
about toco American exhibitors In this depart­
ment, 150 English, and 150 rrom other European
countries which Is about 250 more than entered
tbe Vienna machinery exhibition. Extra pro­
vision Is being mado for annexes to accommodate
the hydranli machinery, tha steam hammerr,
lorges, hoisting engines, boilers, plumbers, car­
penters, Ac
Power In the machinery ball will ba chiefly sup­
plied by a pair of monster Corliss engines. Each
cylinder Is 40 Inches In diameter, with a stroke or
ten feet: the fly-wheel is 31 feet In diameter, and
weighs 55 tons; the horse-power is 1,400: and the
number ot boilers Is 20. This engine drives about
a mile of shafting.
For the att exhibition the most eminent Ameri­
can artists are understood to be at work, and lc
may be confidently stated that, especially la the
department of landscape painting, tha United
States will present a finer display than the public
has been led to expect. Quite aside from the
contributions ol American artists, applications
from abroad call for more than four times. the ex­
hibiting space afforded by tbe great memorial
hall. Provision fer the surplus will be made la
temporary sre-prool buildings, though all exhib­
iting nations will be represented in the central
art gallery. -
Tho Secretary of tha Nary has arranged that a ;
United Slates war ressel shall call next spring at
convenient European ports to collect and trans­
port hither to the Exhibition tha works or AmerK
can artists resident In Europe. Among the ports-thusrar
designated are Southampton for Eng­
land, Havre for France, Bremen lor Germany,
and Leghorn for Italy, to which, if desirable,
others may be added.
Mr. Bell, the eminent Lnglish sculptor, who de­
signed the groups for the plinth for the urea:
Albert memorial In Hyde park, London, Is repro­
ducing la terra cotta, at the celebrated works in
Lambeth, tho one whleh symbolizes America.
The figures In this group are colossal, covering a
ground space or fifteen leetsquare. It will proba­
bly be placed In the great central gallery, oppo­
site tha principal entrance.
Tha art exhibition will Include, In addition to
the works or cotemporary artists, representative
productions of the past century ot American art
these, lor Instance, or Stuart, Copley, Trumbull,
West, Alston, Sully, Neagle, Elliott, Kensett,
Cole. These, as well as the works offered by liv­
ing artists, will ba passed upon by th committee
or selection, who will visit for tho purpose New
York, Boston, Chicago and other leading cities,
In order to prevent the needless transportation to
Philadelphia of works or art not np to the stand­
ard of admlssior.
A large number ol orders and fraternities have
signified their Intention to hold gatherings at
Philadelphia during the period or the Exhibition.
Among those which may now be enumerated,

Cblll has made reparation in the case of
the whale ship ""Good Return,"" seized with­
out 8i!fficient canst- upwards of forty years
ago. Though iihe had hitherto denied her ac­
countability, the denial was never acqui­
esced in by this government, and the justice
of the claim lias been so earnestly contended
for-that it has been gratifying that she should
have at last acknowledged It..
The arbitrator In the case of the United
States steamer ""Montljo,"" for the seizure
and detention of which the government of
the United States of Columbia was held ac­
countable, has decided in favor of the claim.
This decision has settled a qu'^tion which

In March last an arrangement was made
through Mr. C'nshiDg, our Minister in Mad­
rid, with the Spanish government, for the
payment by the lat'^r to the United States
of the sum of eighty thousand dollars in coin
lor the purpose of the relief of the families or
persons of the ship's company and certain
passengers of the ""Vilnius."" This sum
was to have been paid in three instalments
at two months eact-. It is due to the Spanish
government that I s'lonld state that the pay­
ments were fully and spontan'ously antici­
pated by that government and that the whole
amount was paid withiu but a few days
me.ie than two months fjom the date of the
agreement, r copy of which Is herewith
transmitted. In pursuance of the terms
of the adjustment I have directed
the distribution of the amount among the
parties entitled thereto, including the ship's
company and such of the passengers as were
American citizens- Payments are made ac­

entitled thereto.
The past year has furnished no evidence of
an npproachlng termination of the ruiuons
conflict which has been raging for seven
years in the neighboring Island of Cuba. The
same disre rard of the laws of civilized war­
fare and of the just demands of humanity
which have heretofore callcd forth expres­
* Ions of condemnation from the nations of
Christendom, have continue J to blac*?Mi tho
sad pceiie. Itesolatlon, ruin and p. I'.age are

fertile and productive regions of the e;irth,
aud the incendiaries torch, firing planta­
tions ami valuable iac*oiies and building-! is
the agent marking the alternate advance or
retreat of contending parties.
The protracted continuance of tin? Strife frcri­
ously atl'ect3 the interest ot al! commercial
nation*, but those of the United States mar a
than others, by reason ot closj proximity, its
larger tiadc and intercourse with Cuba, and
the frequent and intimate personal and social
re atioiiS wLich nave grown up be'weeu its citi­
zens and these of the Island. Moreover, tlie
property of onr citizens in Cuba is large, and
it> rendered insecure and depreciated in value,
and in < apacity ot production by the coatinu­
i arce of the strife and -he unnatural m>de of its
! conduct. The same is true, differing only in
I degree, with r?""pect to the interests and pro­
I pic of other nation, and the aluence ot any
I rea.-onabl'- as'-urancc 01 a nesr termination of
I the conflict, must of necessity .oon compel the
I str tes thus suffering to consider what the iuter­
I ests of their own people aud their duty t)wjrd
I themselvc< mry demand.
1 have hoped that Spain won'd he enabled to
I establish peace in her colony, tj a:lord security
to the property and the interes'? of oar citinons,
I aud allow legitimate scope to trade and com­
merce andthe natural productions of the ialard.
I Because of this hope, and from an extreme -e­
I luctance to interfere in the most remote man­
1 m'r in the affairs of another and a friendly
I nitiOD, es^acially of one whose sympathy anil
I friendship in the struggling infancy of our own
I e.\iate*-ce must ever be reinem'jsrcd with giati­
I tuJe, I have patiently and an: ously waited the
I progress ot events.
Our own csvii ODflict Is too recant for as nit
I to consider the difficulties which surround a
I goverrment distracted l>y a dynastic rebellion
I at home, at the same time that, it lias to cops
I with a separate insurrection in a distant colony.
I Butwhate\er causes may have produc d the
I situat ion which so grievous'y aff'ects our inter
I ests, it exists, with all its attendmt evils, ope -
1 rating directly upon this country and its p Jpic.
I Thus !ar al! the efforts of Spain have proved
I abortive. aLd t.me has marked do improvement
I in the situation. The armed binds of either
I si *e now occupy nearly the satn3 ground as in
I the paet, with the difference, from time totiiae,
I of m-'.e lives sacrificed, more property destroy­
! ed, and wider extents of fertile and productive
I fields and more and more of valnable property
I coii-tantiy wantonly sacrificed to the incen­
i diarv's torch.
I In'contests of this nature, where a consider­
I able body of people who have attemptel to
I free themselves or the control ot the superior
I government have reached such a point in os­
I cupation of territory. In power and in general
I organization as to constitute in fact a body
I politic, havmg a government tn substance as
I well as in name, possessed of (he elements of
stability, and equipped with the machinery for
I the administration of iuternal policy and the
I execution of its laws, prepared and able to
| administer justice at home, as well as in its
I dealings with other powers, it is within the
1 province of those other powers to recognize its
! existence as a new and independant nation. In
such cases other nations simply deal with an
I act rally existing condition of things, and
J recognize as ono of the powers of the earth
| that body politic which, possessing the neces­
I sary elements, has in fact become a new power.
I In a word, the creation of a new i-tate is a fact
I To establish tae condition of things essential
I to the recognition of this tact, there must be a
1 people occupying a known territory, united
under some known and defined form of govern­
ment, acknowledged by those subject thereto,
I in which the functions of Government are ad­
ministered by usual methods, competent to
mete out justice to citizens and strangers; to
I afford remedies for public and for private
wrongs, and able to assume the correlative in­
I temit'onal obligations and capable of perform­
ing the corresponding international duties re­
sulting from its acquisition of the rights of sov­
ereignty. A power should exist complete in its
organization ready to take and able to main­
tain its place among the nations of the earth.? J
While conscious that the insurrection in
I Cuba lias shown a strength and endurance
which make it at least doubtful whether it be
I in the power of Spain to subdee it, it seams
unquestionable that no such civil organization
I exists which may be recognized as an indepen­
dent go>ernment, capable of performing its in­
ternational obligations, entitled to be treated as
one ol the powers of the earth. A recognition
under such circumstances wonld bo incon^ist- j
I ent with the facta, aad would compel the power
I granting it soon to support by force the govern­
ment to which it had really given its omy cl tiui
of existence.
In my i idgment the United States should a<l­
I hereto the policy and the principles which
I have heretofore been its sure and safe gu des
in like contests between revolted caloa.es an d
their mother country, and acting enly upon th e
clearest evidence, should avoid any lOHbility
of suspicion or of imputation. A recognition
of the independence of Ouba being in my opin­
1 ion impracticable and indefensible, the ques­
tion which next presents itself is that, of the re­
I cognition of belligerent rights in tho partiea to
the contest.
In a farmer message to Congress I had occa­
I sion to consider this question, and reached the
conclusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful
and devastating aa were its incidents, did not
I rise to the feariul dignity of war. Kegajdlng
I It now alter this lapse of time, I am unable to
see that any notable success, or any marked or
real advance on the part of the Insurgents has
essentially changed the character or the con­
teat. It baa acquired greater age but, not
greater or more formidable pro- irtiona. It la
possible that the acta of foreign powers,
and even acta of Spain herself, of this
verv nature, might be pointed to in de­
fence of such recognition. Bat now M in
lta past history, the United States should
carefully avolu the false lights which might
lead it into the mazes of doubtful law and of
questionable propriety, and adhere rigidly
and sternly to the rule which has been it*
aide, or doing only thai which la right and
oneat and of good report.
The question of according or with­
holding rights of belligerency must be
judg'd in every case. In yl?w of the
particular attending facta. Unless jus­
tified by necessity it la always and
justly regarded as an unfriendly act and a
gratuitous demonstration of moral support
to the rebellion. It is necessary and
it is required, when the interests of
another government, or of Ms people,
are so far affected by a pending civil
conflict as to require a definition of
lta relations to the partiea thereto. But
this conflict most be one which will be recog­
nized in the sense or international law, as war.
Belligerence too ia a lact. The mere existence

of contending armed bodies, and their occa­
clonal conflict#, do not constitute war, in the
sense referred to. Applying to the existing con­
dition ot affair* in Cuba, the test* recognised
by Publicists and writers on international law,
and which have been observed by nations of dig­
nity, honesty and power, where free from sensi­
tive or seldeh and unworthy motives, 1 fail to
find in the insurrection the existence of such a
substantial political organisation and palpable
and manifest to the world, having the
forms and capable of the ordinary
1 unctions of government toward Its own peo­
ple and to other states, with court* for the ad­
ministration of jastice. with a local habita­
tion, possessing sur-h organization of torce, such
ma' ;rial, such occupation of territory as to take
the contest out of the category of a mere re­
bellious in?urrect;on or occasional skirmishes,
and place it on the terrible footing; of war, to
which a recognition of belligerency would aim
to elevate it. The contest, moreover, is sole'v
on land; the insurrection has not possessed itself
of a single seaport whence it may send forth
its flag, nor has it any means of communica­
tion wilh foreign power""?,except through the mil­
itary lines of its adversaries. No apprehen­
sion of any of those sudden and diffi­
cult complications which a war upon the ecean
is apt to precipitate upon the vessels, both com­
mercial and national, and npon the Consular
officers of other powers calls for the definition
of their relations to the parties to the contest.
Considered as a question of expediency, I re­
gerd the accordanco of belligerent rights still
to be as unwise aud preventative, as I regard
it to be, at present indefensible as a nwasure of
right. Such recognition entails upon the coun­
try according the rights which tlow from it
difficult and complicated duties and requires
the exaction from the contending parties of the
strict observance of their rights and obligations.
It confers the right of search upon the high
stas, bv vessels of both parties, it would sub.
ject the carrying of arras and munitions of war
which now may be transported freely and with­
out interruption in the vesse'sof th?J United
States to detention and to poesibleseizure.it
wonld give rise to counties? vexatious ques­
tions, would release the parent govern­
ment from responsibility for aots done
by the insurgents, and would invest
Spain with the right to exercise the supervi­
sion recognized by onr Treaty of lT!>j over
our commerce on the high seas, a very largo
part oif which In its traffic between the At­
lantic at il the Gulf slates and between all of
them and the states on the Pacific, passes
through the waters which wash the shores of
Cuba. The exercise of this supervision could
scarce fail to lead, if not to abuses, certainly
lo collisions perilous to the peaceful rela­
tions of the two states. There can be little
? doubt to what result such supervision would
before long draw this nation. It would be
unworthy of the United States to inaugurate
the possibilities of such result, by measures
of questionable right or expo.iieucy or by
any indirection.
Apart from any question of theoretical
right, I am satisfied that while the accord­
ance of l>clligerent rights to the insurgents
In Cuba might give them a hope, and an in­
ducement to protract the struggle; It would
be but a delusive hope and would not re­
move the evils which this government and
its people are experiencing. but would draw
the United State* into complications which
it has waited long and already suffered
much to avoid. The recognition of imlepen­
der.ee, or of belligerency, being this In iny
judgment equally inadmissible, it remains
to consider what course shall l>e r looted
should the conflict not scon be brought to an
end, by acts of the parties themsel ves, and
should the evils which result therefrom,
aufecting all nations, au<i particularly the
United States, continue, in such cve'it I
am of opinion that other nations will be
compelled to assume the responsibility which
devolves upon them and to seriously consider
the only remaining measures possible, media
Uon and intervention. Owing perhaps to the
large exparse of water separating the ieland
from the Peninsular, the waat of harmony and
personal sympathy between the inhabitants of
the colony and those sent thither to rule them;
and want ot adaptation of the American colo­
nial system of Europe to the present timed, and
to the ideas which the events of the pa-t c>-n­
tary have developed; the contending pai ties
appear to have with:n themselves no
tory of common confidence, ta sugg>st wiWDi*.
when passion and excitement have their s.va>­
and to a=sume the part of pea-.e-maker. In
this view, In the earlier ila's of the cent --' die
good officf s of the United States a* a Media or,
were tendered in good raith, without
any selfish purpose, in the interest ot
humanity, and in sincere friendship for
both parties, but, were at the
time declined by Spain.with the declaration,
neevertheless, that at a future time tiicy
?would be indispensable. No Intimation lias
been received that in the opinion of Sp iin
that time has been reached. And yet tbe
strife continues, with all its dread horrors
and all its injuries to the interests of the
United States and of other nations. K ieh
party seems quite capable of working great
Iniury and damage to the ot her, as well as to
ail the relations anil Interests dependent on
the existence of peace in the island, but they
seem incapable of reaching any adjustment,
and both have thus far failed of achieving
any succcss, whereby one party shall possess
ana control the island to the excluslou of the
other. Under these cii cumstances, the agency
of others, either by mediation or by interven­
tion. seems to be the only alternative, which
must sooner or later be Invoked for
ttie termination of the strife. At the same
time, while thus impressed, I <10 not at this
time recommend the adoption of any meas­
ure of intervention. I shall i?e ready at all
times, and as the equal friend of both par­
ties. to respond to a suggestion that the good
offices of the United States will be acceptable
to aid in bringing about a peace honorable
to both. It is due to Spain so far as this
government is concerned, that the agency of
a third power, to which I have adverted
shall f>e adopted only as a last expedient.
Had It been the desire of the United States
to interfere 111 the affairs of Cuba, repeated
1 eppertunities for so doing have been pre­
sent* d within the last few years, but we have
1 remained passive and have performed our
whole duty, aud all international obliga­
tions to Spain with friendship, fairness aud
fidelity, aud with a*spirit of patience and
forbearance which negatives every possible
suggestion of desire to Interfere or to aid to
the difficulties with which she has bean sur­
rounded. The government of Spain has re­
cently submitted to oui minister at Madrid
certain projtosais, which it is hoped may be
found to be the basis if not the actual sub­
mission of terms to meet the requirements
of the particular griefs ct wbicn this govern­
ment has felt itself entitled to complain.
These proposals have not yet reached me in
their full text. On their arrival they will b?
taken into careful examination, and may, I
hope, lead to a satisfactory adjustment of the
(.uestlons to which they refer, and remove
the possibility of future occurrences such as
l ave given rise to our Just complaints. It
is understood also that renewed efforts are
being made to introduce reforms in
the internal administration of the Island.
Persuaded, however, that a proper regard for
the interests of the United States and of Its
cltisecs entitle it to relief from the strain to
which it has been subjected by the difficul­
ties of the questions, and the wrongs aud
losses which arise irom the contest in Cuba,
and that the interests of humanity itself de­
mand the cessation of the strife before the
whole island shall be laid waste, and larger
sacrifices of life be made, I shall feel It my
duty, should my hones of a satisfactory ad­
justment and of the early restoration of
peace and the removal of future causes of
complaint be unhappily disappointed, to
make a further communication to Congress
at some period not far remote and durlDg the
Sresent session, recommending wnat may
3en seem to me to be necessary.

The boy is indeed the true applo eater,
and is not to be questioned how he came
I bv tho fruit with which his pockets are
lilletl. It belongs to him, and he may
steal it if it fan not bo had in any other
way. His own jufcy flesh craves the juicy
I flesh of the apple. Sap draws sap. Ilis
fruit eating has little reference to the state
of his appetite. Whether he be ifull of
meat or empty of meat ho wants the applo
I all the same. Before meal or aftor meal
it never comes amiss. The farm boy
I munches, apples all dny long. He has
! nests of them in tho haymow, mellow­

ing, to which'he makes frequent visit*.
Sometimes old Brindlc, having access
through the open door, smells them out
and makes short work of them.
Tho apple is indeed tho fruit of youth.
As we grow old we crave apples less. It
is an ominous sign. When you are
ashamed to be seen eating them on the
street; when you can carry them in your
pocket and your hand notconstantlyjfind
its way to them; when your neighbor has
apples and you have none, and you mako
no nocturnal visits to his orchard; when
your lunch-basket is without them and
you can pass a winter's night by the fireside
with no thought of the fruit at your
elbow, then be assured you are no longer
a boy, cither in heart or years.
The genuine apple-eater comforts himself
with an apple in their season as
others with a pipe or cigar. When lie
has nothing else to do, or is bored, he
cats an apple. While he is waiting for
[ the train lie eats an apple, sometimes several
of them. When he takes a walk he
arms himself with apples. His traveling
bug is full of apples. lie odors an apple
to his companion, and takes ono himself.
I Thcv are his chief solace when on the
road. He sows their seed all along the
I routo. He tocsos tho core from tho car
window and from tly? top of the stagecoach.
He would, in time, mako the
land one vast orchard. Ile dispenses
with a knife. IJjo prefers that his teeth
shall have tho first taste. Then he knows
the best flavor is immediately beneath
the skin, and that in u pared apple this
is lost. If you will stew the apple, he
says, instead of baking it, by all means
leave the skin on. It improves the color,
and vastly hightens the flavor of the dish.
The apple is a masculine fruit; hence
women arc poor apple-eater?/. It belongs
to the open air, and requires an open air
taste hnd relish.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026844/1876-01-04/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,wvu_belgium_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Wheeling daily intelligencer.,Campbell & M'Dermot,"Wheeling, W.

One of the crying evils of these times
is the tendency and disposition of girls
to get through girlhood hurriedly and
get into woman h-od, or rather into
young-lady-hood, without waiting to en­
joy the beautiful season of girlhood.
Speaking on this point, Bishjp Morris
says, ""wait patiently, my children,
through the whole limit of your girl,
hood. Go not after womanhood; let it
come to you. Keep out of public view.
Cultivate retirement and modesty. The
cares and responsibilities of life will come
soon enough. When they come you will
meet them, I trust, as true women
Bhouhl. But oh! bo not so unwise as to
throw away your girlhood. lol not
vonr.celves of tlm beautiful season,
which, wisely spent, will brighten all
your luturti life.""

A DIPLOMA OF IIONOlt?MEDAL OF .M Bit IT AND
CERTIFICATE OF DISTINCTION AT THE CEN­
TENNIAL.
! Philadelphia, October 2. 1STG.?Messrs.
W.M. Kn'ABE & Co. have won a great victory,
i and they are to be congratulated. Thev tri­
; umph over all competitors in the Piano Forte
i Department, and have been awarded the high­
I est honors in the power of 'he Centennial au­
thorities to bestow. The Judges of Awards
and the Centennial Commission have unani­
mously decreed them the Diploma of Honor,
the Medal of Merit, and, in addition, a Certifi­
cate of Distinction. The reports of the Judges
specifying the elements of' merit are the only
reliable exponent- of their decisions, and their
report on the Knabe Pianos states that their
instruments possess t he highest excellence,and
that they more nearly approach perfection than
a':y other, in power, richness and sympathetic
quility of tone, id ease and certainty of action,
?;tid in elegance and durability of wotkruanship.
This leaves nothing to be desired, and in re
cognizing and couimendr u this rare combina­
tion ofqualities in all tleir styles ol Gran-is.
Squares arid Uprights, the Judges have acted
wisely, and have but endorsed and ratified the
opinion of the great majority* of visitors at the
Centennial. The Messrs. Knabe & Co. have
made less noise, aud have been more sparing in
the use of bombast than some of their compet­
itors, preferring to leave with the Judges the
duty* ot' detorming which Pianos w- re really
the best. The Judges were all experts, aud
they have honestly rendered their vcrdict in
favor of the Knabe Piano. The public will
doubtless commend their action.

A Kentncky Flood.

A correspondent at Orleans, Orange
county, on the line of the Louisville, New Al­
bany & Chicago railway, sends particulars ot
a fearful rain storm which took place in that
region, commencing Saturday morning and
lasting till daylight Monday morning. The
rain was a perfect flood, the water not pour­
ing down as usual, in drops, but in perfect
heets. The ground resembled a lake, the
water having poured upon the town until
half the place was flooded. Water -rose as
high as the window tops, and asyet has fallen
but little. In addition to the destruction oi
household goeds, barns, stables, etc, large
lots of cattle, horses, hogs and other animals
were drowned. Lost River is extraordinarily
high. The bridge over this river between
Orleans and Paoli is swept away. This was
the bridge on which Packard and Lungett
were hanged by vigilantes several years ago.
At the present time it is impossible to com­
pute the damage which the fleod has occa­
sioned along the bottoms of Lost River, but
it will be unusually heavy—probably 9100,000
amount.

The Markets.

A New York dispatch says: Wheat
dull and heavy election returns absorbing
attention of both buyers and sellers sales of
78,000 bu., including rejected spring en priv­
ate terms old and new No. 3 Milwaukee
spring, mixed"", at $1,17 graded No. 1 spring
at $1.37 ungraded Minnesota spring at
•1.32# Red Ohio winter at $1.30 amber
Kansas at $1 30.

The Milwaukee wheat market ruled firm at
$1.17 tor No. 1, and $1.10 for No. 2. Seller
January $1.13.

Minneapolis and St. Paul Millers are paying
$1.00 and $1.03 for No. l.and 95o to 97c for
Iowa corn brings 44c to 46c for grinding.
Oats are in large supply at 30 and 32c the
quality ot receipts is interior.

Butter, at St. Paul sold last week at 12j£c
for good firkin, and 14s for extra firkin.
Choice dairy packed brought 20 and 22c.

Another War Rumor.

A cable special to the New York
Herald says the Turkish fleet was about to en­
ter the Black Sea and will take the position off
Sicope and Trebizan, both of which Black Sea
ports have been recently fortified. If this oc­
curs, the history of 1843 may be repeated, for
it will be remembered it was off Sicope that the
Turkish vessels were destroyed by the
Russian fleetunder Nakemoff, with a
loss to the Turks ot 4,000 men.
This act on the part ot Russia made
the Crimean war inevitable. The ad­
vance of a Turkish fleet into the Black Sea
may fire the mine which all Europe is shudder­
ing to see exploded. A nother special from the
Herald's correspondent at Vienna declares
that Servia has been tendered 10,000 breech
loaders lor her militia by the Grand Duke
Michael Constantine, commandingthe Russian
forces in Bessarabia. Where the men will be
found who are to use those arms remains to be
seen. The theory in Vienna is that they must
come across the Russian frontier.

Closing of the Centennial.

At an early hour on the 10th the
crowds bagan to enter the Centennial grounds
to witness the closing ceremonies. At the
time of beginning the ceremonies, fully 100,000
people were inside ^he enclosure. Shortly be­
fore 2 o'clock President Grant, escorted by
General Hawley, ascended to the platform, fol­
lowed by the centennial commissioners, the
board ot finance, foreign commissioners and
invited guests. After the excitement of the
multitude, occasioned by the presence of Pres­
ident Grant, had subsided, the orchestra, un­
der the direction of Theodore Thomas, per­
formed Wagner's inauguration march, com­
posed for the opening exercises on the 10th of
May last. At its conclusion, Rev. James A.
Ruas offered up a prayer. The chorus, accom­
panied by the orchestra, then sang a choral,
entitled ""Fugrie."" by Bach.

AmAttempt Made to Steal the Bones of Presi­
dent Lincoln.
A more dastardly outrage never was
committed than that attempted at Springfield,
111., last Tuesday night. It was no more nor
less than to carry off the bones of President
Lincoln. The detectives had got wind ot
something of the kind, and were consequently
on the alert. The outer door was broken in,
the inner door opened, and the case of the sar­
cophagus removed when the detectives sprang
out just as the villains were making off with
the remains. By the accidental discharge ot a
pistol the robbers were alarmed a moment too
soon and succeeded in making off tothe woods.
A slight clue to their identity remains, and
their capture is probable. The motive for this
most outrageous proceeding must have bejsn
the same that prompted the abduction of Char­
lie Ross—money,—and the frustration of the
designs ot the robbers is a subject for rejoicing.

Cardinal Antonelli Dead.

A London Times Dispatch from Rome
ays Cardinal Antonelli was transacting busi­
ness with the pope ©n Suuday when he was
seized with a severe attack of gout in the chest.
He was immediately carried to his apartment.
He refused to believe that death was approach­
ing. At last he consented to receive the sacra­
ment, but was unable to swallow. He ex­
pired at 7:15 Monday morning, shortly after
sending a message to the pope asking for his
blessing and imploring pardon for all the faults
he might have committed during his adminis­
tration The fortune left by the cardinal will
be divided among the members of his family.
His fine collection of gems, antiquities, works
of art, &c, are bequeathed to the Vatican mu­
eum.

Ossian E. Dodge.

The death of Ossian E. Dodge is an­
nounced from London. Mr. Dodge was born
in Cayuga, N. Y., in October, 1820. In early
life he taught a music school in Massachusetts,
and was for along time engaged in giving con­
certs with Covert, which made him famous as
a humorous singer all over the country. On
the first appearance of Jenny Lind in Boston
he made himself somewhat notorious by pay­
ing $6'i0 for a single-seat ticket. In 1851 he
went to London as a delegate to the World's
Peace Convention, hi literary and journalistic
circles he made many friends, his sketches on

Palestine, Egypt, and Assyria, over the nom
de plume of ""Ivan Ort"" having attracted much
attention in Europe.

The Presidential Election.

At the present writing it appears
that the late election has furnished fuel for an
almost unending contest between the twogreat
political parties upon the legality of the re­
turns from two or more of the Southern States.

substantially as follows:

In order to insure a lair count in Louisiana
President Grant has invited the following Re­
publicans to proceed to New Orleans to wit­
ness the canvass: Hon. Wm M. Everts,Judge
E. W. Stoughton, Gen. John A. Dix, and Gen.
James A. Van Allen, of New York Senator
Sherman and Hon. Stanley Matthews, of Ohio
Hon. Courtland Parker, of New Jersey Sena­
tor Edmunds, of Vermont Gen. Harrison, of
Indiana Senator Logan of Illinois Hon. W.
D. Kelley, and Hon. Sohn Schoenburg of Penn­
sylvania and Hon. John A. Kasson, of Iowa.

The Democratic National committee has sent
Governors Ingersoll, Hubbard, Robbinson, Bell,
Curtin, Palmer, McCreery, Carroll and others
also Senators Thurman, Bayard, Randolph,
McDonald, Kernan, and others also A. S.
Hewett, chairman Democratic National Com­
mittee, ex-Senator Trumbull, and Doolittle of
Wisconsin.

In relation to Florida the President has is­
sued the following orders:
Gen. W. T. Sherman, Washington D. C—
Instruct General Augur in Florida to be vigi­
lent with the force at his command to preserve
peace and good order, and to see that the pro­
per and legal boards ot canvassers are unmo­
lested in the preformances ot their duties.
Should their be any grounds for suspicion of
fraudulent count on either side, it should be
reported and denounced at once. No man
worthy of the office of president should be
willing to hold it if counted in or placed there
by fraud. Either can afford to be disappointed
in the result. The country cannot afford to
have the result tainted by suspicion of illegal
or false returns.

U. S. GRANT.

General Sherman, Washington: Send all the
troops to General Augur he may deem neces­
sary to ensure entire quiet and a peaceable
count of the ballots actually cast. They may
be taken from South Carolina unless there is
reason to expect an outbreak there. The pres­
ence ot citizens from other States, I under­
stand, is requested in Louisiana to see that the
board of canvassers make a fair count of the
votes actually cast. It is to be hoped that rep­
resentatives and fair men of both parties will
go. U. S. GRANT.

Price of Food in Old Times.

From the English Magazine.

Amid the never-ending comments on
the high price of provisions, it is dif­
ficult for us to realize the fact that a
time existed in Britain's history when
wheat, as food for 100 for a whole day,
was worth only a shilling, and the
average price of sheep four pence. In
the reign of Henry I. the price of wine
was raised to six pence a quart for red
and eight pence a quart for white, in
order that the sellers might be able to
live by it. When wheat was at six
shillings a quart (eight bushels), the
farthing loaf was to be equal in weight
to twenty-four ounces if made of the
whole grain, and to sixteen ounces if
consisting solely of white. And when
wheat was only one shilling and six
pence per quart, as it sometimes was,
the farthing white loaf was to contain
sixty-four ounces, and the whole grain
ninety-six. Think of purchasing a six­
pound loaf of good wheaten bread for
a farthing In the nineteenth year of
the reign of Edward I., the price of
provisions of the City of London was
fixed by the Common Council at a tar­
iff by which two pullets were sold at
three halt-pence, a partridge or two
woodcocks for the same, while a fat
lamb was to be six pence from Christ­
mas to Shorvetide, and the rest of the
year four pence. In the fourteenth
century Parliament fixed the price of a
fat ox at forty-eight shillings, a shorn
sheep at five shillings, two dozen eggs
at three pence, and the best wine at
twenty shillings per tun. An act of
Parliament, passed in 1533, settled the
value of beef and pork at a half-penny
per pound, and veal at three farthings.

In a thriving town of Michigan, a
year or two ago. hen the country was
full of agents, and almost everybody
was agent for something or other, a
certain infant of the town, being
blessed by the advent of a baby broth­
er, was very inquisitive as to where
the little stranger came from. Being
informed that Dr. S. had brought it,
he stood ina brown study for amoment,
when, with the intelligent look of one
who has solved a difficult matter, he
asked: ""Saypa, is he the agent for
them?""

Speaking of the retention of the
Main building, a Chicago editor who
stood near Memorial hall on Thursday
was politely requested to ""move on
by a member of the Centennial com­
mission. The latter said the editor's
feet dwarfed the structure.

A Blow to Woman's Hopes.

W O A N 'S cause has finally received
a fatal blow. Chief Justice White
makes a decision.against the plea of
Belva Lockwood, a* femenine practic­
ioner in the Washington courts, for
privelege to plead in the supreme court.
Miss Lockwood has won a great many
complicated suits during her career,
and makes as imposing an appearance
in court as the best ofth district law­
yers. Just why a lawyer is disbarred
from the supreme bench, who prac­
tices acceptably in other courts, does
not appear plain to the lay mind. It
may be rational enough to deny women
the right to vote, though, as yet, no
one has given a rational and conclu­
sive definition of the causes which
render woman sufferage incompatible
with the rights specifically guaranteed
by the constitution. To the lay mind
it looks very much as though Judge
White had made a decision altogether
inconsistent with the theory of the
American constitution, which has nev­
er been known to refuse women the
protection guaranteed to men, nor re­
leases her from the obligation of taxa­
tion, which implies the same rights as
her fellow-voter. There was but one
immunity accorded woman as a recom­
pense for the denial of the right of
equal effort with mankind, that is lia­
bility to military duty,—the least fre­
quent but the most arduous put up­
on the male citizen. It would have
been forgiven Judge White had he
taken the most liberal construction of
the law and given woman the right of
earning her bread in any fashien which
her tastes or her talents fitted her for.
It is not unlikely that the chief justice
will hear from the women of America
when this curious decision is general­
ly realized.

fouragh of Arctic Explorations.

The recent return of the steamers
Alert and Discovery from a fruitless
mission to the frozen region about the
North pole seems to call to mind how
much treasure has been squandered,
how much suffering has been endured,
and how many lives have been lost in
the vain attempt to penetrate an ocean
which nature"" closed by impassable
barriers.

The expedition which attracted the
most attention was the one command­
ed by Sir John Franklin. The two ves­
sels, the Erebus and Terror, which
conveyed his party, left England May
24, 1845, but never returned. The loss
of the brave men who constituted this
party seemed to stimulate rather than
to discourage the spirit of adventure.
There were now two things instead of
one to find—the lost party and the
passage they went to discover. Twen­
ty one expeditions in all sailed from
different countries for the purpose of
obtaining information in regard to the
fate of Sir John Franklin.

Great Britain offered rewards
amounting to $20,000 for his discovery,
and expended S5,000,000 in the various
expeditions sent out. A spirit of ri­
valry sprung up among the different
nations to see which would penetrate
the vast frozen sea the greater dis­
tance. This spirit was shared by the
people of the United States, as was
shown by the expeditions of Kane,
Hayes, and others.

These expeditions resulted in little
less than in demonstrating that there
is is no passage available for the pur'
poses of navigation, and in obtaining
some evidence that there exists an
open sea about the North Pole. The
expedition lately returned to England
found the best proof against the exist­
ence of such a sea. The party which
composed it found ice varying from 80
to 150 feet in thickness, and so broken
and rugged that a progress of only a
mile per day could be made over it. It
is to be hoped that the day for Arctic
expeditions has passed. It is not pos­
sible that any benefits to commerce can
result from them, and it is very hard
to see in what way science is to be
benefited by future Arctic voyages.

Had the money that has been spent
in frutless expeditions in the direc­
tion of the North pole been employed
in stimulating discoverers in practical
science, the world might have been
better and wiser therefor. Half the
people in this country rely on soft
coal for fual. but we have not found
out how to burn it without having
the best portions of it pass into the
air in the shape of soot or unconsumed
gas. Botasnits inform us that no use
has been found for thirty-nine-forti­
eths of the plants now known to them.
We are in comparative ignorance to­
day of the science of making steel,
and still our civilization largely de­
pends on its manufacture. With so
many things to find out, any one of
which would be of immense value to
the world, we may as well remain
awhile in ignorance of some matters
pertaining to the Polar sea.

Failure of New York's Water Supply.
TnE water-famine so long predicated
in New York City, and scouted by its
people as a roorback, has come upon
them. The city has, as everybody
who took the trouble to think about
it foresaw, outgrown the Croton water­
supply. All summer the head was
insufficient to, supply residences in the
more elevated portions of the city for
more than a few hours out of twenty­
four. The rains that it was hoped
would swell the volume of the Croton
River haven't come, and the reservoir
is now drained so low that the Grand
Jurors of the city and country have
felt it their duty to urge the authori­
ties ""to restrict the waste and use,
even to the watering of the streets
and its continuous flow in basins.""
They also ""call upon our fellow-citi­
zens of all classes, in their own de-

fense, to arrest all unnecessary use of
water, for, in the event of a fire occur­
ing in a combustible quarter, their in­
terests, in common with all would be
jeopardized."" Upon the like grounds,
the Police Board has isued strict oders
to all roundsmen to exereise ""a strict
surveillance in their respective
precincts over the use of the
Croton water, to stop sidewalk and
street washing with hose also, waste
in stables, hotels, dining-rooms,
saloons, water-closets, etc and to
report promptly such persons as are
wasteful or extravagant, that their
supply may be cut off,"" Withal the
supply is still insufficient. It is, too,
the opinion of many engineers that,
in the four years which, according to
the estimates, would be required to
build additional reservoirs, the popula­
tion will have increased beyond the
utmost supply that can be darwn frem
the Croton and its feeders, It will
cost not less than $26,000,000, accord­
ing to the estimates, to increase the
reservoir-capacity. But' before enter­
ing upon it, the question occurs, where
can a new supply be drawn from

Be Agreeable at Meals.

You tell us to be agreeable and en
tertaining during our meals. Some of
us have not the faculty of ready
speech. What's to be done in such a
case? Ans. Every one can do some­
thing to add to the social life at
the table. If one cannot talk he can
listen or ask questions, and draw out
others who can talk. Good listeners
are as necessary as good talkers. Nev­
er argue at the table but tell pleasant
stories, relate or read anecdotes and
look out for the good of all. Some­
times a single anecdote from a paper
starts a conversation that lasts during
the meal time. A family table ought
to be bright and cheerful, a sort of
domestic altar, before which everyone
casts his or her offering, great or
small, ofpleasantness or peace where,
for at least a brief space in the day,
all annoyances are laid aside, all stormy
tempers hushed, all quarrels healed
everyone being content to sit down to
the same board and eat the same bread
and salt, and making it, whether it be
a rich repast or a dinner of herbs,
equally a joyful, almost a sacramental
meal.

A Slaughter of 320,000 Bulgarians.

E Cologne Gazette observes that
Bulgaria has on several occasions fig­
ured in history as the scene of ""atroc­
ities"" no less horrible than those lately
committed by the Bashi-Bazouks. The
Greek Emperor Basilius II. was nick­
named ""Bulgaroktonos,"" because he
ordered 15,000 Bulgarian prisoners to
have their eyes put out, a few only be­
ing left with one eye in order that they
might guide their fellow-prisoners
back to their homes. Even more atro­
cious was the massacre of the Gothic
settlers in Bulgaria. The much prais­
edEmperor Claudius II. gives the fol­
lowing account of this massacre in a

Killing A Highway Robber.

San Franciaeo Bulletin, October 35th.

As E Weaverville stage was com­
ing down the mountain about thirteen
miles north of Shasta, yesterday after­
noon, a highwayman suddenly jumped
from behind a bush, covering Wells,
Fargo & Company's messenger, John
McNemir, with a shotgun before he
could make any resistance, and de­
manded the treasure box, which he
was forced to hand over. The robber
started for the brush with his booty
and ordered the driver to drive on.

As soon as they were out of sight of
the robber, McNemir jumped from the
stage, ran back, got on the robber's
track, followed him a short distance,
where he found him taking the treas­
ure from the box, which he had al­
ready broken open with a pick. Mc
Nemer fired at him, knocking him over.
The robber jumped up and ran a short
distance, when McNemir gave him the
contents of the other barrel, killing
him instantly. He then recovered afl
the treasure and brought it safely here.
He left the dead body of the robber at
the Tower House.

Kerosene Explosion.

A E I LE accident occurred in
Madison Wis*., last Wednesday morn­
ing causing the death of Mrs."" George
P. Delaplane and the injury of two of
her daughters. Mrs. Delaplane was
aroused from sleep by a hailstorm
which passed over the city. She pass­
ed through the house carrying a ker­
osene lamp which exploded in some
manner unknown, setting fire to her
clothing. Her daughters came to help
her and succeeded after considerable
effort in subduing the flames, but not
until Mrs.Delaplane was terribly burn­
ed. The daughters were severely in­
jured, but not fatally. Mrs. Delaplane
died last night about midnight. She
had lived in this city many years, and
her tragic death caused great grief
among her friends and neighbors. Mr.
Delaplane was absent on business in
Minnesota.

The fact that the proprietors of
SASFORD'S RADICAL CURE FOR CATARRH are1
permitted to refer to so well-known and re­
spected a gentleman as HENRY WELLS, Esq.,
of Wells, Fargo & Co.'s express, must weigh
heavily in its lavor.

An Incident of Revolutionary Times.

After the battle of Long Island,
which was fought August 27,100 years
ago, and after the capture of Ne
York city by the British, General
Howe made his headquarters in Ne
York, leaving Staten Island in com­
mand of Col Dalrymple. The wounded
from the bloody Brooklyn field were
taken to the Island and billeted upon
the farm-houses. It was Howe's cus­
tom to visit the temporary hospitals
regularly, in order to satisfy himself
that his men were receiving proper
care. On one occasion, during a heavy
storm, he and his staff took shelter
under a farm-house shed. Farmer
Cole, seeing the party outside, ap­
proached them with a hearty invita­
tion to enter the house, and rest until
the storm should subside. Mrs. Cole
was churning in the kitchen, and the
guests occupied the sitting room. ""We
are very hungry,"" said a member of
the staff ""can you give us something
to eat
""I can't leave my churn,"" said the
practical housewife.
""I'll churn for you,"" said a splendid
uniformed officer.

Forthwith he was sent to work, Mrs.
Cole having taught him how to use the
dasher.

As she proceeded with her culinary
work, ever and anon she glanced at
the toiling officer. ""Well,"" said she
to his brother officers, ""if he can't use
a sword better than he can the churn
dasher, he must be a mighty poor sol­
dier.""

This sally raised a hearty laugh, in
which the volunteer churner joined
heartily. He kept on gallantly, the
prespiration streaming from every
pore. It was the hardest work he had
ever done in his life.
""That's right,"" said Mrs. Cole, en­
couragingly, ""keep on long enough
and you'll fetch butter.""

When the storm had ceased the mil­
itary gentlemen took their leave, first
offering to pay for their entertain­
ment. ""We don't keep tavern,"" said
Mrs. Cole, with that short decisive snap
of a farmer's wife, and the officers
rode away.
""Keep on long enough and you'll
fetch butter,"" became a household ex­
pression in the British army, and was
taken to the other side of the water,
where it was uttered many times to en­
courage those who were striving to ac­
complish results under difficulties. A
short time after the occurrence at the
farm house, Mrs. Cole received a par­
cel from New York. It contained a
splendid black silk dress and a letter
of thanks and compliments from Sir
William Howe. It was he who had
done the churning. The dress is an
heirloom in the Cole family, and the
letter is preserved as one of the few
pleasant reminiscences of a war in
which the weaker party carried out to
a successful issue the suggestion made
by the farmer's wife, ""Keep at it long
enough and you'll fetch butter.""

Liquefaction of St. Januarius' Blood.

The correspondent of an English
Roman Catholic paper at Naples says
of the miraculous liquefaction of the
blood of St. Januarius:

You cannot imagine the cries and
the almost shrieks and screams of the
people that were going on all this
time. And when the priest held it up
and cried out, ""It is hard,"" they be­
gan to weep and wail on all sides in
the true Neapolitan style. The re­
liquary is an old-fashioned silver one,
of an oval shape, surmounted bv a sil­
ver cross about four or five inches
long, by which the priest holds it.
Thick glass is let into the sides, so that
you see the interior plainly wh6n held
up to the light and to show you more
clearly the bottles inside a priest holds
a small lighted taper behind, by aid of
which you see two small ""ampullm,""
or cruets, the large one containing
about an ounce and a half of some ob­
scure, congealed substance of a brown­
ish tint, not unlike to that of clotted
blood when it has been exposed a long
time to the air. It is quite hard, for
the priest reverses the reliquary, and
not the slightest motion is visible in
the dark matter which fills about two­
thirds of the phial. Both bottles ap­
peared to be hermetically sealed. The
priest laid the reliquary down on the
altar. He had taken it all round, had
shown it to the many kneeling there,
when he once more lowered it and
put it before my eyes. I was not cer­
tain, but it seemed to me that as he
held the reliquary upside down the
straight line which was formed across
the bottle was breaking on one side,
and that the substance commenced to
move slowly. I am sure my excited
face and the paleness I felt coming
over me must have shown the canon
what had happened. Yes, there it was,
slowly moving down on one side of the
bottle, a few reddish brown drops. He
held it aloft to the people and cried,
""It is liquified."" I cannot express to
you the strange feeling which crept
over me when the canon again showed
me the reliquary and slowly turned it
around. I saw the blood flowing in­
side the large phial as freely as water.

A new lovcntlou, ul a simple uud practical na­
ture, hai of late been successfully up|iHed in
several places iu Germany and France. Tbo
system consist* of electric candles, or sticks of
charcoal, surrounded by isolating matter, which
gradually consumes, (earing the' charcoal free
like a wick, which slowly melt* away under the
brilliant glow* of electricity. With two such cau­
dles a light equal to that of lUO gas*Jcts muv be
thrown uu a street. An clectro-msgactiu ma­
chine can keep burning twcuty uf these electric
candles. The cost Is about half that of gtu, and
the light ts of tbo brightest and purest kind.
The ErfelderZett any gives the following account
by an eye-wlmess oi tbo working uf tula mode
of lighting in the machine factory of the broth­
ers Mcer, at Gladboch:
“The great building was enveloped lu total
darkness when we entered Soon after one uf
the proprietor* lighted tbo small developing
apparatus, lu sUe not longer than thirty Inches,
and lu height nut mora than sixteen inches. A*
soon as it Was set in operation, by a small steam-

power with which It wa* connected by a belt, the
immense machine-room was Inntantaneouniy lit
up an bright as day. At the entrance of the
name there wa"" to be seen only one lamp, at a
height of fifteen or sixteen feet, which gave out
a most brilliant and steady light. U waa so
dear that the finest shades of indigo-dyed silks
could he rasllydfstlngnlshcd. Theclcctrlclltrht
was distributed In such a manner, through the
agency of a mirror, that a long slay lu the room
In no wise Injuriously affected the eyes. Ongoing
Into Ihc garden an electric lantern, suddenly
lighted, Illuminated the whole neighborhood to
such a degree* that at 100 Icet very fine
print could be read, and at 250 feel larger and
ordinary characters were plainly legible. Of the
wonderful properties of this electric light wo
had the dearest proof, ami we were further
pleased to learn that In this establishment the
cost la estimated at a fourth to a sixth of gas­
light. In large rooms, halls, public squares,
and streets the electric light before long Is sure
to take the place of gas as an Illuminating agent.’
In France It la rapidly growing in favor, and Is
in operation In forty establishments. The im­
mense depot of the Chemin dc Fer du Nortl at
Parts is about, also, to be lighted by ibis same
electric system. There is ho danger
whatever of fire from It, which gives
ft an Immeasurable advantage over all
other means of illumination. The Faria Engl­
nccra Gramme, and the Chief Engineer Von
Ilcfcncr Allcncck, of the Unit of Slcmcns-
Ilaiske, In Berlin, were thft first who construct­
ed the new electro-magnetic machines, bv means
of wlUdi a pleasing mechanical power is converted
In a simple and practical manner Into electric
light. This Invention is one of the most re­
markable of modern limes.

""Outdoor work can he carried on by night aa
well as by day with this light, as ft expels the
darkness and fills the atmosphere with an al­
most •unlike lustre. In the lighting of dtlc* by
this new process, the economy, as compared
with /704, will bo at least fid percent. We are
evidently on the ovo of as great a revolution In

The Mortuary Poet.

He was a country-looking chap, with
an odd mixture of sorrow and resigna­
tion on his lean countenance, and he
dropped upon the startled advertising
clerk of the Bangor Patriot with the
mysterious whisper ol:
""She's gone.""
""Who's gone?"" asked the clerk.
"" Maria.""
""Who in thunder's Maria?""
""My wife; she's gone.""
""Gone where?""
"" Up above died last night want you
to put it in your next issue.""
""What ailed ber?""
""Lockjaw; she lay for three weeks
and couldn't speak. Never had such a
quiet time in the house before. Just do
the notice up fine, will yon, an I'll see
that every thing is fixed up all right,""
Accordingly, the clerk scribbled away
for a moment, banded out what he had
written for inspection, and curtly re
marked :
"" Dollar thirty-five.""
The bereaved husband read it over
carefully, and finally gave a Bigh pf Eatr
isfaction.
"" That's all riiht."" he said, handing
over the required specie, "" but I s'pose
you could put a verse on the end,
couldn't you?""
Well, yes,"", ruminated tne cien,
"" guess so. What kind of a verse do you
want?""
""Somethin' tender-like an' sorrowful.""
""How would this do?"" asked the
clerk, scratching his head with the end
of his penholder.
"" A perfect female, folks did consider her,
She a gone and left a weepin' widower.""
"" That's kinder melancholy,"" reflected
the stranger, "" but I reckon it's aleetle
jest a leetle too personal. Just you try
it again. 1 don t mind puttin up ban­
sum for sum thin' that'll rake folks'
heart-strings.""
The clerk gazed at the ceiling for a
moment, and then suggested :
"" The husband's lost a wife,
The cnildren ma,
Died on Fiiday night.
From the lockjaw.""
"" -Yes,"" broke out the mourner, wip­
ing his nose with a black-bordered hand­
kerchief, ' but you see I don't own any
young'uns.""
"" What do you think of this, then ?""
"" She always waa contented ;
At life she'd never carp.
Gone to be angel,
And play on a golden harp.""
"" Don't believe that'll suit. You see,
Mariar couldn't even play on a pianner,
an' I know a harp would stump her,
sure. Poor .woman; she had a tender
heart, though, and made the most ele­
gant biscuit you ever saw.""
"" Hanged if I won't have to charge
you extra,"" growled the clerk. "" I ain't
a Longfellow or Tennyson.""
"" I know,"" meekly replied the "" weep­
in' widower."" ""Jest try once more,
won't you?""
So the clerk did try, and at last
ground out the following :
"" On earth could not stay Mariar,
So she died and went up higher.""
""Sorter irreverent, am't it?"" anx­
iously asked Maria's relict. "" I reckon
I wouldn't grudge a couple of dollars
for a bang-up verse.""
Thus stimulated, the machine poet
became suddenly inspired, and exult­
ingly produced :
""Cry for Maria!
Alas I she ia no more
Joined tbe singing seraphs
Upon the other Bhore.""
The afflicted one uneasily took a chew
of tobacco, and whispered :
"" Beautiful ; but there's one thing
that spiles it. Mariar hadn't any more
melody in her than an old plough, an'
it's deliberit lyin' to speak of her as a
vocalist. None cf them other syrups
(seraphs) you allude to could keep time
with her.""
""Well,"" thoughtfully remarked the
discomfited clerk, ""if .this ain't all O.
K. you'll have to hire a special poet;
I'm played out :
""Affliction sore
Long time ahe bore,
Physicians were in vain.
Lock-jaw ketched her,
Death it fetched her.
Gone to rise again.""
"" Tell you what,"" enthusiastically ex­
claimed the widower, 11 that's tip-top.
Here's your two dollars ; you've aiint
them. A young man that can make up
sich affecti n' lines as them has got a glori­
ous future before him 1""
And squeezing the exhausted poet's
hand, the elated speaker left in search of
a pair of black kid gloves.

fetding his way as to these. He desires to be

its lilx.-r.il toward the southern people as he
dare. The President's southern policy his
action as to South Carolina and Louisiana

lias arrayed it wains t him Blaine, Wade

Wendell Phillips, the carpetbaggers and

crats have a majority in the house, and this

detection mav trive an opposition majority in

portant that he have a majority in both houses
favorable to his administration. Whether he
shall have this majority depends on the

southern Democrats. If they oppose the ad

as kamlail or sayler, to the speakership, and
ally themselves with disaffected Repul .icans

extend him a support, he will le able to deal

Southern I emoerats now have the power to

The President is firm and determined in his
southern policy, if the south will give him the
support necessary t3 carry it out. In my
opinion the true method for the Democratic

party in the south to protect itself, and main

tain its successful oiganization, is for that

party to declare in favor of ilr. Hayes's ad

The Postage Stamp.
The postage stamp was born in London
ou the 10th of January, 1810, and Eng­
land employed it alone for ten years. It
was a curious incident that gave rise to
the idea of postage stamps. A traveller
was crossing, about forty years ago, a dis­
trict in tbe north of England. He arrived
tbs door of an inn where a postman
had stopped to deliver a letter. A young
girl came out to receive it; she turned itf
oyer and over in her hand and asked the*
price of postage. This was a large sum,
and evidently tbe girl was poor, for the

so she returned it to the postman. The
traveller was a man who rambled about
the earth for instruction and observation.
Having a good heart, he offered to pay
the postage of the letter, and in spite of
the resistance of the young girl lie paid
the shilling. This resistance made him
reflect. Scarcely had the postman turned
his back when the young inn-keeper's
daughter confessed that it was a trick be
tween her and her brother. Some signs
marked on the envelope had told her all
she wanted to know, but the letter con
tained no writing.
""We are both so poor,"" she said, ""that
we invented this mode of corresponding
without paying for our letters.''
The traveller, continuing hia road,
asked himself if a system giving place to
such frauds was not a vicious one.

As soon as they have formed the first flow­
er in the open ground, pinch off the end of
the first shoot, and as soon as the rose is
fully opened, pick it off. No rose should
be left to fade upon the bush, as when so
left it exhausts the plant in the formation
of seed. As the plants grow, pinch back
the ends of the shoots when they have
grown six inches, and rub out all puny
shoots, thus keeping the plants in a round­
ed, open bush form. If strong shoots
alone are left to grow, they will soon con­
trol the strength of the plant, and the
flowers will be few and often of imperfect
form. Should the season bo hot and dry,
a mulch of flue, fresh grass or sawdust, or
moss from the woods, should bo placed all
over the soil, three inches deep, and at
night watered thoroughly, not sprinkled,
but wet like a day’s rain. The Hybrid
Perpetuals or Noisettes require this prun­
ing or pinching back, more promptly than
the Teas, Bengals or Bourbons.

of the head, and then picking hiu; up

threw him dowu an area way a distance of

have originated from Gould's having be

A West Side clergyman was called ont the
other night to minister by the dying bed of a
prominent citizen. “ Was he connected with- a
savings bank? ” asked the divine. “He was a
Trustee,” replied the messenger. “ Well*
there’s no use my going,” said the pastor:
“ still, the mercy of Heaven is infinite, and
there’s no saying,—so I had better go through
the motions, perhaps.”

False Hair.
False hair, for ladies' wear, being re­
cognized as a necessity of modern social
existence, the want must be somehow
supplied. But live hair, hair bought,
to use the technical phrase, ""on foot '
the hair of girls and women bribed to
submit their locks to the shears grows
annually scarcer aud dearer. When the
modestdemand for tresses was influenced
by a fow elderly dames in need of wigs,
the supply was easily secured by agents
who bargained with the peasant maids of
Brittany and Auvergne. Paris alone
would now consume all, and moro than
all, of the available capillary crop in
France, and Marseilles, the present cen­
tre of the hair trade, deals with Spain,
the East, and especially the two Sicdies,
for the forty tons of dark hair which she
annually makes up into 65,000 chignons.
"" Dead hair "" has something of a sinis­
ter, sepulchral sound; but as without it
the cheap curls, fronts, and chignons
could not be made at the price, it may
be comfortable to know that the original
owners of the raw material are, as likely
as not, alive and well. Rag-pickers value
no unconsidered waif and stray of the
street, short of gold ring or silver spoon,
so high as the clotted combings of female
hair, soon to be washed with bran and
potash, carded, sifted, classed, and
sorted. There are, commercially, seven
colors of hair aud three degrees of
length. Much dead hair enters into the
cheaper of the 350,000 ""pieces"" annu­
ally made in France. The dearest
chignon costs about $1.25 in England,
the cheapest a fiftieth part of that
amount. England is the best customer,
and close upon her heels comes America.

THE ART OF PROLONGING LIFE.
People generally desire long life and good
bealtn. Sickness and premature death areal­
most always due to violations o£ the laws that
govern our physical being, and of which the
masses are ignorant. If men knew better they
would do better; bat how can they avoid au
evil that they know not of? While efforts are
made through the public schools to give each
child a so-called common English education, yet
the children are permitted to grow uu and enter
upon the responsible duties of active life pro­
foundly ignorant of the structure of their own
bodies, and the laws of physical being upon
which their health and lives depend. They are
sent to school and crammed with arithmetic,
grammar, and geography, by teachers who, in
many instances, have never studied physiology
and hygiene. They are taught to locate the
mountains and trace the rivers of foreign coun­
tries, but arc never taught to locate the vital
organs and glands of their own bodies, or trace
the veins, arteries, and nerves in their various
ramifications. They are iustructed in the flow
of the tides, and the course of the ocean cur­
rents, and the philosophy of winds and storms;
but they have no correct conception","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84031492/1878-05-05/ed-1/seq-16,"","",16,"","",1,dlc_michigan_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Chicago daily tribune.,"","Chicago, Ill.","","",5953,7380,2452,3779,16,19108,25580,0,dlc_michigan_ver01/data/sn84031492/no_reel/1878050501/0016.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_michigan_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84031492%2Fno_reel%2F1878050501%2F0016.jp2/pct:31.154490,28.850665,12.832322,14.773260/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_michigan_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84031492%2Fno_reel%2F1878050501%2F0016.jp2/pct:31.154490,28.850665,12.832322,14.773260/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Washington, July 3.—Before the Potter
committee to-day, Emila X. Weber testi­
fied that the conference held in New Or­
leans during the count in 1876, was under­
stood to have been led by- Senator Sher­
man. Iu conversation with Senator Sher­
man, witness was assured that if his brother
should stand by his protest, he would be
protected. In compliance with a request
of Sherman, witness went after his brother
and Anderson, and informed them that the
visiting statesman were desirous of seeing
them. Anderson in reply said to tell them
to go to h—1. His brother, however, went
to see Sherman and they had along conver­
sation regarding the protest. Two or three
days after this conversation occurred, his
brother showed him the Sherman letter of
assurance, and told him that Sherman gave
it to him at the conclusion of the confer­
ence, relative to him standing by his pro­
test, and remarked that it was tlie best that
he could do at that time. —Did your
brother agree to stsnd by his protest? A.
—He hesitated about doing so, but could
not well avoid it, considering the pressure
brought to bear on him.

By Springer—Did you have llie Sherman
letter in vour hand A.—Yes sir I did.
Q.—What kind of paper was it written
on A.—It was written on a double sheet
note paper.

Witness then showed the size of the pa­
per which was about half the slza of a sheet.
Mrs. Jenks said that the letter was written
un it. She claimed it was written on a
single sheet oNiommercial paper. Witness
said it was arrauged before election by
Messrs. Kellogg, Thomas C. Anderson and
Packard, to secure the affidavits of intimi­
dation, in the parish of east and west Feli­
ciana, for the purpose of throwing out those
parishes. He was assured by Kellogg and
others, that if he would use bis influence
with his brother towards having him make
a protest, he, witness, would be returned to
the senate. He was defeated for state sen­
ator by about 1,200 voles, and was returned
by the returning board, as elected by about
60U majority.

In reply to Mr. Hun ton, witness stated
that some visiting statesmen had interviews
with Eliza Pinkston in the custom house
before she was brought before the returning
boird. He thought that one of those who
interviewed her was Senator Sherman. He
was of the opinion that the Eliza Pinkston
outrage was a put up job.

at 12.30 p. m.; present, Messrs. Potter,
Springer, Butler and Hiscock.
Senator Kellogg was sworn and examined by
Geo. Butler. Ho testified that the election
held io Louisiana in 1370 was entirely legal.
A great many people in New Orleans
thought the returning board had acted improperly
io refusing to return, as elected, certain
persons who they claimed ought to have been
eleoted.
At the request of God. Butler, witness then
proceeded to give a detailed statement as to
the composition of the respective houses of
the Legislature, and after reciting the law of
Louisiana at considerable leogth bo stated that
/""i ill i ? i, . D ,

uov. ractara was legally inaugurated on tne
Sth day of January, 1S77, at which time there
was a republican quorum in both houses.
Geo. Butler produced a tablet containing
tables compiled from tho retumiog board
figures, which showed that after tho board had
thrown out sufficient democratic parishes to
elect the General Assembly that it was found
that there were still two Hayes electors
dofbatcd, whereupon tho returning board
proceeded to further throw out parishes and
precincts until they had succeeded in securing
a rmjoriiy of Hayes electors.
Witness stated that, assuming the figures to
be the correct findings of the returning board,
it left the General Assembly republican in both
branches, and still left two Hayes electors in
the minority.
By Mr. Butler?Whereupon tho board proceeded
to give tho sorew another twist ?
Witness?That is not my testimony.
Q.?How maoh on tho returns as returned
by the returning hoard did the lowest Hayes
elector run behind Packard ?
A.?These tables show a majority for Governor

To the Kilitor of the I'lattsburg Republican.
Allow me to say a few words of the
greatest importance to the public through
your journal, in regard to the terrible
disease diphtheria, which is raging with
great destruction of lives throughout (
the country. It has rage<I hereto a fear- (
ful extent, quite a large numbered cases |
proving fatal.
There is a family hereby the name of !
Light, a miller who moved here from |
Rochester this season. Mrs. Light said
to some of the neighlsjrs that previous |
to moving here she had an attack of ,
dipthcria and cured herself by the use of |
lo-riiscne oil as a trarele also swallow ing ,

some; but tlio remedy was so simple that
ourcitizens didn't think anything of it
until five of Joseph Jelley s children
were taken down with the diphtheria.
Their throats became swollen and cankered
terribly. Mrs. Jelly sent after her
neighbor, Mrs. Milliette, who had lately
lost a son bv the disease, to ascertain
whether it was really diphtheria or not.
Mrs. Milliette pronounced it diphtheria
in a very dangerous form. Mrs. Jelley
sai<l she wou[d use Mrs. Light's remedy
?kerosene oil?which she gave her
children as a gargle, also had them swallow
some. The children recovered rapidly,
and in a few days were out on the
street.
Another neigldior by the name of
Lusia, railroad trackmaster at this place,
had three of their children taken with
diphtheria, and cured them with kerosene
oil.
William Finery bad four children
taken down ane gave kerosene oil and
they recovered.
Robert Gillette was taken with it and
cured himself with kerosene oil.
John Reynolds of lngraham had a
daughter and niece cured bv kerosene >
oil has after they were given up for j i

one bottle of the Prescription and the Discovery
is belter than six weeks of the White Muuntains
for a sick woman. I have only been out of the
city a week during the whole summer; then
my husband und I went to Buffalo and stopped
at Dr. Pierce's Invalids' and Tourists' Hotel,
The baths and mechanical apparatus for treat­

Stephen Girard's Tactics.?A man
who had ju9t set up in the hardware business,
and who had been a clerk where Girard had
traded, applied to him for a share of his patronage.
Girard bought of him, and when he
brought in the bill, found fault and marked
down the prices.
""Cask of nails,"" said he, ""which I was offered
for so-and-so, you have charged so-andso,
and you must take it off.""
""I cannot do it,"" said the merchant.
""You must do it,"" said Girard.
""I cannot, and will not,"" said the young
merchant.
Girard bolted out of the door, apparently
in a rage, and soon after sent a check for the
whole bill. The young man began to relent
and say to himself: ""Perhaps he tws offered
them at that price. But it is all over now ;
I am sorry I did not reduce the bill and get
it out of him in something else. His trade
would have been worth a good deal to ine.""
By-and-by Girard came in again, and gave
him another job. The young man was very
courteous, and said:

""I was almost sorry I did not reduce your
former bill.""
""Reduce a bill!"" said Girard ; ""had you
done it, I would never trade with you again.
I meant to see if you cheated me.""

FARM, GARDEN, AND HOUSEHOLD.
When Mitl Where to Apply Wood Aahe..
The agricultural editor of the Hew
York World says: Wood ashes, among
the best of saline manures and atoo nmong
tho most economical, are coming to be
more and tnoro appreciated every year.
Farmers now, as a rulo, husband every
pound made on the farm and buy them
whenever they rnn be procured at a rea­
sonable rate. The timo has gone by for
oxclianging ashes from good liftrd wood
for-a few pounds Of soap.
Leached ashes, while less valuable,
contain all the elements of the unleached,
having been deprived only of a part of
their; potash and soda. Ashes benefit all
soils not already rich in the principles
they containi And nitty be drilled in with
roots nnd grain, sown broadcast on
meadows or pastures, or mixed with the
muck heap.
Tho quantity of ashes to be applied' to
the acre depends, as does that of nil fer­
tilizers, on the character of the soil and
crop cultivated. Crops which exhaust
the salts, as potatoes, turnips and all roots,
clover, . lueern... peas, beans and the
grosses, are benefited by nshes. The

crops named thrive well under an nppli--
!..! i. ... .i i .... i .V
vnuun oi iiMirs nil uonc-uusi, ami xneir
effects are also strengthened when mixed
with gypsum. Light soils call for light
dressings, say from ten to fourteen
bushels of unleached and twice that
quantity of leached ashes per acre. Rich
lands or clays bear heavier dressings.
Repeated dressings of ashes like repeated
dressings of lime or gypsum, without a
corresponding addition of vegetable or
barnyard manures are not adniissable,
for they will eventuallv exhaust lands
when applied alone. Where the entire
surface of the soil is covered with vege­
table growth either of the three materials
mentioned acts with great effect. For
this reason ashes may lie applied un­
mixed with other fertilizers' to meadow
lands for a longer time than to any other
crop.
In reply to question asked at the E1­
niira (N. Y.) Farmers' club in regard to
the value of leached ashes ami the best
manner of apply ing them to general crops,
as corn, wheat and oats, the following
information was gained: I'aclied ashes
vary so much in their character that no
precise estimate of their value can be
made. Heavy clay is liable to be in­
juriously compacted by liberal dressings
of ashes, leached or 'unleached, unless
the land is sod. in which case ashes
spread on the surface tend to increase the
crop of grass. The safest and bel tiseol
leached ashes on most kinds of soil
is spreading them on old meadow
or old pasture. Working them
into land on which potatoes are to be
planted in the same season is also a good
way to use them. .Good allies make a
valuable dressing for wheat land and for
corn, but the leached ashes are too un­
certain in their character to recommend
for such use.
Coal ashes are inferior in quality to
those from wood and vegetables, but are
nevertheless of value and are to be ap­
plied to the soil in a similar manner, as
they tend with their abundance of cin­
ders to the mechanical division of soils.
Coal nshes are beneficial to heavy rather
than light soils.
Farmers, in consideration of the above
facts, cannot he too strongly encouraged
to follow the practice of collecting and
reducing to ashes all the rubbish of the
farm not otherwise available, such as
brush, old wood, sods, rags in fact
everything which cumbers the place as
useless matter. Burnt earth is not only
a manure in itself, but is most useful to
mix with artificial fertilizers which can­
not bo easily distributed alone or too
Strong to sow among seed unmixed with
other material.

The year 1878, it appears, has been
rendered memorable to American pomo­
joitists by reason of the large number oi
new native fruits wliich were originated
or introduced during that time. The list
of peaches especially has been great iy in­
creased. In a paper read before the
West'-rn New York Horticultural Society
by William C. Barry descriptions of
thirty peach seedlings never before d""­
scrihed were enumerated as having come
to tho notice of this well-known nursery­
man, while many more were fruited
which are not yet made known to the
public. According to Mr. Barry the
Slate of New York offers several candi­
dates for popular favor. From the great
metropolis even come two new varieties
which apparently possess many valua­
ble qualities. In Western New York
there are several seedlings which will
undoubtedly prove desirable. One of
them is believed to be the largest and
earliest of all the very early peaches.
Several excelWnt early and late varieties
have originated in Ohio. Passing over
a vast extent of country are found a
number of new kinds in Missouri, Kan­
sas and Nebraska. From Kansas comes
the information that the whole list of
'arly peaches known to the public, so
far lis fruited in Kansas in 1878, is sur­
passed both in earliness and size by at
least fifty new seedlings of Kansas origin,
many of wliich bore their first fruit that
year. At the South, too, many promis­
ing new sorts are mentioned. Thus, as
if by magic, during the same year and in
various sections of country new peaches
have sprung up in such numbers as to
astonish and almost perplex the fruit
culturist.
Touching upon tho few new apples
brought to notice the past year, Mr.
Barry had a word to say about the Rus­
sian apples which have caused more or
less discussion. Of the varieties under
trial for some time several have given
evidence of value, and while they can
hardly bo compared in quality to our
best apples, still they are fair and will
doubtless prove desirable in those locali­
ties where only hardy varieties succeed.
What portion of the largo number of
new strawberries introduced are worthy
of cultivation Mr. Barry thought it diffi­
cult as yet to say. Another season's ex­
perience will be required"" before definite
and reliable information can be given
concerning many of them. Of a number
which have been well tested the Sharp­
less is given a prominent place, as are the
Cumberland, Triumph and Crescent
seedling. Among new raspberries the
Gregg was pronounced a decided im­
provement on the older varieties of black
caps. New York ,World.
Early Corn.
A correspondent of VicWs Magazine
gives the following directions for bring­
ing corn to maturity early in the season,
adding that he picked corn last year in­
side of sixty days from tho time of plant­
ing : "" Let the conditions of the soil and
manure be the best you can command,
and aside from the frequent wading and
hoeing, stirring the ground thoroughly,
thin the stalks to three or four three is
best if you would have the largest ears
and most of them, Pluck out most un­
mercifully every sucker and non-bearing
stalk that process alone will hasten
your corn a week or ten days, as I have
come to believe from experiment. I
have added this year a top-dressing at
the hill, when the corn was well up a
compost of one part plaster, two parts
ashes, and two parts fine manure, which,
I think, has been a great advantage.""
Those who wish early corn should not
only have for seed, what is called "" an
early kind,"" but they should obtain it
from as for north as possible. Sled
corn raised in Canada .and taken south
will come to perfection one, two or three
weeks earlier than that ripened on the
spot. The reason is that the seed raised
in the north has adapted itself to a short
season. This is true, iq a measure, of
all see4s,

Rnford's Career.
The Cincinnati Enquirer devotes nn
article to Henry Buford, the Kentuckian
who shot nnd killed Judge ,1. M. EllioU.
of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, in the
streets of Frankfort. The Enquirer says :
Buford's history shows him to bo a
man utterly regardless of law, of his ow
life or that of others, when his passions
are aroused. Somewhere in the '50s Bu­
ford was the hero of an affray on tlio
ington fair grounds, wliich had -a great
deal of notoriety at the time. He nnd n
gentleman named Thomas, of Mt. Ster­
ling, had quarreled, and, meeting on the
fair grounds, immediately opened lire on
each other. Buford displayed character­
istic t-Oolnoss nnd recklessness, changing
his (position oncfi'i-while. Thomas -was
firing, to avoid shooting in the direction
of some ladies, nnd at another time de­
liberately taking a pin from the lapel of
his rout nnd picking the tube of his pis­
tol, which had failed to go off. He
wounded Thomas, and escaped unhurt
himself. A gentleman of Lexington
named Ferguson was keeping Thomas
supplied, with pistols. Gen. Abe
Buford made at him with a bowie-knife
rind slashed at his throat. Ferguson
ducked his head and the knife shnved
his beard, taking off a good-sized piece
of his chin, which fell into the posses­
sion of Mr. Mulligan, of Lexington, who
exhibited it for some time in his store
window ns a curiosity.
Another .incident in Buford's career
happened nt the time when the three
colonels were editing tho Times, in
Louisville. Buford sent a noted hello in
that city a bucket of sausage from his
home near Versailles. Theodore O'llara.
author of the famous ""Bivouac of the
Head,"" one of the three colonels, made
the present n subject of ridicule in his
paper. As soon as the paper reached
Versailles, Buford, taking a friend with
him, got in his buggy, and by driving
rapidly nnd taking fresh horses from
time to time nrri veil in Louisville early
in the night. Reaching the Gait Housb
and going in, be found O'llara at the
bar taking a drink. Stepping up to him
and inquiring as to his authorship,
O'llara acknowledged it. and Buford at
once struck him. They struggled,
clinched anil fell, O'llara underneath.
O'llara drew a pistol, and reaching
a rou lid Buford, tried to shoot him; but
his si-use of humor prevailing over his
wrath, ho got to laughing so that lie
could not discharge it. They were sepa­
rated before any damage was done be­
yond a good beating for O'llara, and
lbiford returned home.
Still another, attended with worse re­
sults, was his assault on Mr. Ulysses
Turner, of AVoodford, a brilliant young
lawyer, and at one timo a member of the
banking firm of Saylor, Shelby & Co.,
of Lexington. Buford had some busi­
ness controversy with him, attacked
him, and beat hiin so brutally about the
bend that his life was despaired of, his
health wrecked and his sight permanent­
ly destroyed. Mr. Turner died a short
time ago, after years of suffering and
blindness.
Buford's last violent exploit before the
present murder was his defiance of the
authority of the sheriff of Henry county
in the earlier stages of the suit,' the final
decision of which was the cause of the
as:issination.

The Sonp Stone.
A lady in the outskirts of Denver was
the victim tho other day of a tramp's
practical joke. 'Even in these vagabonds
there is an occasional vein of humor
which is worth preserving. Tho inci­
dent happened in thiswise: About the
middle. of the afternoon a tramp put in
an appearance and asked politely if he
could bo permitted to cook, for himself a
plate of soup.
"" I have the ingredients with me,"" he
said, displaying a cobblestone about the
size of an apple.
The lady very naturally looked at
bin in surprise.
"" You can't make soup out of that
rock, can you ?"" she inquired.
"" Oh, yes, madam. This is what we
call a soup stone."" .
"" Well, I should like to see you do it ;""
and she forthwith made up a fire in the
stove and the tramp commenced opera­
tions. He filled the stove pan with
water, and after it commenced to boil,
very carefully deposited the stone in a
pan in the water.""
"" I shall have to trouble you for a lit­
tle seasoning,"" he said, nnd the lady has­
tened to get him an onion, a piece of
meat and a pomato. These were can-fully
cut up and put in to boil along
with the stone. In a short timo a de­
licious plate of soup was prepared. The
lady tasted it and was delighted with the
flavor. The fellow sat down and ate,
and his hostess immediately ndded what
was necessary to make a substantial
meal. When he left he said he could
get plenty of soup stones on his waya, nil
he woulcf leave that one with her as an
evidence of how sincerely he appreciated
her kindness. She was firmly convinced
that she had come into possession of a
treasure. That night she told her hus­
band of the circumstance. He listened
to the recital and then inquired inno­
cently: .
"" l)on't you think the meat nnd the
onion and tho tomato would have made
a very good soup without the rock?""
Gradually the trick began to dawn
upon her, and if you want to make that
lady mad, you have only to ask her for
the loan of her soup stone. Rocky Moun­

feature of the firmament. It completely
encircles the whole fabric of the skies,
and sends its light down upon us, accord­
ing to the best observations, from no less
than 18,000,000 of suns. These are planted
at various distances, too remote to be
more than little understood; hut their
light, the medium of measurement, re­
quires for its transit to our earth periods
ranging from ten to 1,000 years. Such is
the sum of the great truths revealed to us
by the two Hersehels, who, with a zeal
which no obstacle could daunt, have ex­
plored every part of tho prodigious circle.
Sir William Ilerschel, after accomplish­
ing his famous section, believed that he
had gauged the milky way to its lowest
depths, affirming that he could follow a
cluster of stars with his telescope, con­
structed expressly for the investigation,
as far back as would require 330,000 years
for the transit of light. But, presump­
tuous as it may seem, we must be per­
mitted to doubt this assertion, as the
same telescope in the same masterhand
was not sufficiently powerful to resolve
even the nebulas in Orion. Nor must we
forget that light, our only clew to those
unsearchable regions, expands and de­
composes in its progress, and, coming
from a point so remote, its radiant waves
could be dispersed in 6pace. Thus the
reflection is forced upon us that new
clusters and systems, whose beaming
light will never reach our earth, still
throng beyond, and that, though it is
permitted to man to behold the immens­
ity he shall never see the bounds ofcrea-U-..

While yet In love with life and raptuj-ed with
the world, he passed to silence and pathetic
dust. Yet, alter all, it may be best, just in the
happiest, sunniest hour of all the voyage, while
eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an Instant hear
the billows roar above a sunken ship. For
whether in mid sea or'mong the breakers of the
fai ther shore a wreck at last must mark tho
end of each and all. And every life, no matter
If Its every hour is rich with love and every
moment Jeweled with a joy, will, at its clo^a,
become a tragedy as sad and deep and dark as
can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery
and death. This brave and tender man in evei y
storm of life was oak and rock; but in the sunshine
he was vine and flower. He was the
iriend of all heroic souls. He climbed the
heights, and left all superstition far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning
of the grander day. He loved the beautiful, arid
was with color, form and music touched to
tears. He sided with the weak and with a willing
hand gave alms. With loyal heart and
w ith the purest hands he faithfully discharged
all public trusts. He was a worshipper of liberty,
a friend of the oppressed, a thousand
times I have heard h'm quote these words:?
"" For justice all place a temple and all season
summer."" lie believed that happiness was the
only goGd, reason the only torch, Justice the
only worship, humanity the only religion, and
love the only priest. He added to the sum
of human Joy; and were every one to
whom he did a lov'ng seivice to bring
a blossom to his grave, he would sleep
to-night beneath a wilderness of flowers.
Life is a narrow vale between the cold and
barren peaks of two eternities. We strive in
vain to look beyond the heights. We cry aloud,
and the only answer Is the echo of our watl'ng
cry. From the voiceless lips of the unreplj ing
dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can
hear the rustle of a wing, lie who sleeps here
when dying, mistaking the approach of death
for the return of health, whispered with his
latest breath, ""I am better now."" Let us believe,
in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears
and tears, that these dear words are true of all
the countless dead. And now, to you, who have
been chosen from among the many men he
loved to do the last sad office for the dead, we
give his sacred dust. Speech cannot contain
our love. There was, there is no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.

In the House of Lords the Marquis of Huntley
last evening complained of the railway companies
for carrying American meats at lower
rates than English, because of the larger quantities
In which the former are sent. He pointed
out that such action was protection for American
farmers, and asked whether the matter had
been brought to the attention of the Board of
Trade and the commission on agricultural
depression. The Duke of Richmond, lord president
of the council, replied that the granting of
Ereferential rates was a violation of the law,
ut Lord selborne doubted it.

Wahhinqton, March 8.—The following mes­
sage was read by the Senate to-day:
To the Senate—l transmit herewith the re­
port of the secretary of state and accompany­
ing papers in response to tho resolution adopt­
ed by the Senate the 11 th of February last,
requesting copies of all correspondence be­
tween this government and any foreign
government since February, 1869, respecting
a ship oanal across tbe isthmus between North
America and South America, together with
oopics of any project or treaties respecting tbe
same which the department of state may have
proposed and submitted since that date to any
foreign power or its diplomatic representative;.
In -further compliance with the resolution of
the Senate I deem it proper to state briefly my
opinion as to the policy of the United States
with respect to the.const ruction of an inter­
oceanic canal by any route across the Ameri­
can isthmus. The policy of this country

IS A CANAL UMDBB AMERICAN CONTROL.

The United States cannot consent to sur­
render this control to any European power, or
to any combination of European powers. If
existing treaties between the United States and
other nations, or if the rights of sovereignty or
property of other nations stand in the way of
this policy, a contingency which is not appre­
hended, suitable steps should be taken by just
and liberal negotiations to promote and

ESTABLISH AN AMKBIOAN POLICY
on this subject consistent with the 'rights of
the nations to be affected by it. The capital
invested by corporations or citizens of other
countries in such au enterprise must, in a great
degree, look for protection to one or more of
the great powers of the world. No European
power can intervene for such protection with­
out adopting measures on this continent which
the United States would deem wholly inadmis­
sible. If the protection of tbe United States
is relied npon the

UNITED STATES MUST EXERCISE SUCH CONTROL
as will enable this country to protect its na­
tional interests and maintain tbe rights of
those whose private capital is embarked in the
work. An inter-oceanic canal across tho Amer­
ican- isthmus will essentially change the geo­
graphical relations between the Atlantio and
Pacific coasts of tbe United States, and be­
tween the United States and the rest of the
world. It will be the great ocean thoroughfare
between

OUR ATLANTIO AND OUR PACIFIC SHOBES
and virtually a part of the coast line of the
United States. Our merely commercial inter­
est in it is greater than that of all other coun­
tries while its relations to our power and pros­

; Bauds of music are forbidden to plav
.ou many of the large bridges. There
| are, doubtless, two reasons for this. A
■ succesiou of sound waves,especially such
as cornea frem the playing of a good
band, will excite the wires to vibration.
At first the vibrations are very slight,
hut they will increase as the sound waves
continue to come. This is known in
acoustics as sympathetic vibration. To
what extent this affects bridges we are
unable to say. The principal reason
why bands are not allowed to play while
crossing certain bridges, the suspension
bridge at Niagara, for example, is that if
followed by soldiers, or processions of
any kind, thev* will keep time with the
music and this regular step of a crowd
or company of soldiers would cause the
wires to vibrate. At the suspension
bridge military companies are not allow­
ed to march across iu regular step, but
must break up ranks. The regular trot­
ting gait of a largo dog across a suspen­
sion bridge is more dangerous to the
bridge than a heavily loaded wagon
drawn by a team of horses.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033139/1880-03-25/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,whi_grace_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Manitowoc pilot.,Jeremiah Crowley,"Manitowoc, Wis.","","",13734,4554,2499,4710,1,22671,29427,0,whi_grace_ver01/data/sn85033139/00271769349/1880032501/0863.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manitowoc%2C_Wisconsin,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/whi_grace_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85033139%2F00271769349%2F1880032501%2F0863.jp2/pct:60.579595,15.475584,11.022893,16.005709/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/whi_grace_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85033139%2F00271769349%2F1880032501%2F0863.jp2/pct:60.579595,15.475584,11.022893,16.005709/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Seasoning Food.
Many people have the idea that a linely
flavored dish must cost a great deal ; that is
a mistake; if you have untainted meat, or
sound vegetables, or even Indian meal, to
begin with, you can make it delicious with
proper seasoning. One reason why French
cooking is much nicer than any other is that
it is seasoued with a great varieiy of herbs
and spices; these cost very little; if "" you
would buy a few cents' worth at a time you
would soon have a good assortment. The
best kinds are saga, thyme, sweet marjoram,
tarragon, mint, sweet basil, parsley, bay
leaves, cloves, mace, celery seed and onions.
If you will plant the seed of any of these
seven first mentioned in little boxes on your
window sill, or in a sunny spot iu the yard,
you can generally raise all yon need. Gath­
er and dry them as follows: Parsley and
tarragon should be dried in June and July,
just before flowering; mint in June and
July; thyme, marjoram and savory in July
and"" August; basil and sage in August anil

we have achieved through immense difficulties
should be preserved; that the peace re­
gained should bo cherished; that tho
Union should be perpetuated, and that

should be transmitted undiminished to other
generations; that the order established and tho

the pensions promised should be paid; that tho

is a supreme law und not a mere contract, [Ap­
plause.] Out of confederated States it made a
sovereign Nation. Some powers are denied to
tho Nation, while others are denied to the States,
but the boundary between tho powers dele­
-gatod and those reserved is to be determined bv
the National and not by the State tribunal

guided not by the genius of any one State, but
bv the average genius of all. [Applause.]
Fourth—The Constitution wisely forbids Con­
gress to make any lav/ respecting the estab­
lishment of religion, but it is idle to hope
that the Nation can be protected against the
influence of secret sectarianism, while each
State is exposed to its domination, we, there­

appropriation of public funds to tho support of
sectarian schools. [Cheers.]
Fifth—Wc reaffirm the belief avowed in 1576

nue should so discriminate as to favor American
labor [cheers]; that no further grants of tho
public domain, should bo made to any
railway or other corporation; that slay­
eiy having perished in the States its twin
barbarity, polygamy, must die in the Territories;
that everywhere the protection accorded to a
citizen of American birth must be secured to
citizens by American adoption. That-wo deem

Chicago, June 14.—A special from Eau
Claire, Wis., says sixty million feet of
logs have gone down the broken portion
of the dam, besides many houses, barns,
and so forth. The river rose twenty-one
feet, reaching the highest point ever
known. It begun to subside at 8 p. M.
There ore one hundred and fifty million
feet at the Big Eddy at the DellB dam,
which Beems likely to break any moment.
Loss in Chippewa valley will probably
reach half a million dollars, and if the
immense jnm moven and allows the en­
tire two hundred and fifty million feet of
logs to pass out it may amount to a mil­
lion dollars. Many houses in the lower
part of the city are flooded, and there is

Thos. Van Nostrand. one of the men rescued
in the waste lock, gave a reporter a thrilling
account of his narrow escape. He sa d there
were 2S men at work In the tunnel. Tney went
on at 12 o'clock last for an eight-hour shift. I
was at work near the east end of the waste
lock, and In the west end of the tunneL It was
at about 4.30 o'clock that I heard the boits snap
and the braces give way. At the same time I
telt a rush of air in my face. I started back
with seven of the men who were near me, and
ran into the waste lock. The air pressure
ci owded the doors shut at the east end. At first
it was blocked by a joLst, which we pulled out,
and then the door slamed too. The lock has doors
at both ends and glass deadeyes to admit the
light. Through the deadeyes we could see
the men inside the tunneL The water was
rushing in. Peter Woodland, the city assistant,
stood at ihe door outside the waste lock, which
was stationary. It would not move with us
without knocking out the deadeyes. This wou d
be latal to the men outside, as the water would
rush in and drown the men in an instant.
Woodland knew this, but he stood at the door,
liis face was ghastly white, and he realized
ihe terrible danger. He said to me: ""Tom,
quick! burst the deadeyes and do what
you can for us."" I knew it was death
to us all If I did not. So I obeyed the order.
As the glass broke the air rushed in, and the
waste lock shot out into the main shaft, leaving
the men to drown, as the space occupied by the
shaft filled with water In an instant. We were
wholly stripped of our clothes when we crawled
out. I heard the rush of the water at our back.
It filled in fast, but the obstructions kept it
back long enough for us to escape from the
main shaft* It was all we could do to
save ourselves. Woodland was standing
In the water up to his waist, when
I last taw him. It was sure death, and I had to
knock out the deadeyes, as I told you. He
knew as well as I that it was all over with them.
I shall never forget the look on his faoe, or the
sound of his voice, as he told us to save ourBelves,
though the very act was to Insure his
death.

It is the main pillar in the edifice of our

of government, however carefully devised;
no principles, however sound, will protect
the rights of the people unless the admin­
istration is faithful and efficient. It is a
vital principle in our system that neither
fraud nor force must be allowed to subvert
the rights of the people. When fraud,
violence and incompetency controls, the
noblest constitution and wisest laws are
useless. The bayonet is not a fit instru­
ment for collecting the votes for freemen
It is only by a4ull vote, a free ballot and a
fair count that the people can rule in fact.
as required by the theory of our govern­
ment, Take this foundation away and the
who'e structure falls. Public office is a
trust, not a bounty, bestowed upon the
holder. No incompetent or dishonest per
sons should ever be entrusted with it,
or if appointed they should nromn-
tly be ejected. Our material in­
terests, varied and progressive,
demand our constant and united efforts.

sigh. Then the new piapaiiue; how
she longed to unfold,the crisp sheet,
luxuiute in its contents, like the
butterfly in the sweets of the honey­
suckle. But Hetty's life more re­
sembled that of the bee than the but­
terfly. Though onlj eighteen, she
was the eldest of seven children,
mostly boys; and a godjjly portion of
the housohold work fell upon her
shoulders. Her mother was a sharp,
bustling woman, and though without
an idea of being unkind, often made
her daughter's life irksome with dis­
tasteful tasks and wearisome confine­
ments.
A glad, girlish voice -aroused Het­
ty. Looking from the window she
saw Susie Lake, one ofjher few inti­
mate friends, leaning on the little
front garden gate.
""Oh, Hetty, do come and walk w ith
me down to Aunt Ellen's. The
morning is just lovely; and I have
something so particula f
""1'in afruid I can't, S ?
Saturday, you know; aid I am sew­
ing and watching baby asleop, while
mother is in the kitchen;"".
""Then I'll have to"" te i you now, I
suppose.""
She came close undet the window,
and said, in a lower V(T
chievous smile:
fc&.A ?
""irAojdo xou, thJuk. I saw ? jjjgt
| now?''
""I don't know. The new minis­
ter?""
""No, indeed; somebody very difler­
ent from that fat-faced old codger,""
returned Susie, irreverently.
""Oh, Susiel But who was it?"" f
""Now, it was just Mr. Walter |
Hayes. Now ain't you surprised?""
A vivid blush dyed Hetty's fair
face. She made no reply, and Susie
continued:
""His employer, Mr. Mitchell, sent
him on business from Philadelphia,
to C , and as this wasn't much
out of the way of his home, they gave
him leave to stop here for a day two;
so he told me when I met you just
now. He arrived only an hour ago,
in the stage from Cox's station; aud
that is how I came to see him before
you did, Hetty,"" she added, laugh­
ingly.
She passed on, leaving Hetty with
flushed cheeks, brightened eyes, and
a heart thrilling with glad excite­
ment. No wonder. For more than
a year past the thought of Walter
Hayes has been the brightest spot of
life, around which all sweot, vague
thoughts of happiness had clustered.
One year ago he had stood at that
same little green garden gate, in the
moonlight, on their late return from
the church concert, and bidding her
good-bye before going away to the
great city to seek his fortune. She
remembered how the warm, linger­
ing clasp of his hand had thrilled her,
and how he had said at last, in a
voice that almost trembled?
""You must not forget me, Hetty.
I shall think of you always, and
when I come back?""
And just then her mother had
como on the porch, and called her in
out of the damp air; and so he had
left her reluctantly. But now he
had come back, and she would see
him to-day.
""I do declare, Hetty,"" exclaimed
her mother, bustling into the room,
warm and flushed from her pie-bak­
ing, ""you are the lar.icst girl I ever
saw. Here you've been upwards of
an hour darning one pair of stock­
ings! What have you boen about?
Dreaming away your lime as usual,
no doubt, and with all the children's
Sunday clothos to look over and lay
out for to-morrow, besides the Satur­
day's 'chores.'""
Hetty penitently resumed ""her
work. But she was very glad when,
i toward sunset, it was all done, and
I she had leisure to run up to her own
' little room; and never in her life had
Bhe taken such pains with her ap­
and mis­

pearanco as now, while she arrayed
herself in what abe considered her
most becoming toilette, a soft, dove­
colored dress, with a knot of a row­
colored ribbon at her throat, and an­
other nestling like a freshly-bloomed
rose in the ripples of her brown hair.
How anxiously she listened for the
expected ring at the front door.? I
How tumultuously her heart beat
when at length it came, and how
heavy it sank when old Deacon
Brown stalked in,- to discuss some
church-mutters*with her father!?
Then she began to look at the clock;
and har heart grew fainter wjd fain­
ter as she ft tra-veling^ sl.ow.ly
leave, Hetty also arose, and lighting
her bedroom candle went slowly and
sadly upstairs.
Whon, next morning, she came
down, her mother remarked, as she
busied herself about the breakfast ta­
ble?
""Hetty, Walter Hayes was here
last night.""
""Oh, mothcrl""
There was something almost pa­
thetic in the look and tone; but Mrs.
Lockwood was too busy with the
steaming coffee-pot to perceive it.""
""He came in just as you had gone
upstairs,"" sho continued. ""He asked
for you, but it was too late, I thought
it hardly worth calling you down
again. He had been seeing Miss
Mitchell home to her aunt's?that
Philadelphia girl, you know, and 1
didn't know until he mentined it,
that she was a niece of his employer,
Mr. Mitchell. He is certainly im­
proved. To my mind, there's noth­
ing like city life for giving people
what they call ityle now. Make Ed­
die's milk-tea, whilst I pour out the
coffee.""
""I think,"" observed Mr. Lockwood,
as he took his place at the table and
cut into the cold corned-beef, ""I
think I heurd Harry Tunstall say
yesterday that young Hayes was pay­
ing attention to Miss Mitchell. He
said he had seen them together in
Philadelphia. She's handsome girl,
and her father's got money. If Wal­
ter marries her he will do well?don't
bolt your food like that; cut it prop­
erly, sir, before eating.""
Hetty turned suddenly sick at
heart. She said nothing, but she
could not swallow her breakfast, and
her mother presently remarked upon
her pale looks.
""Don't you feel well, child?"" I
noticed that you were fidgetty and
nervous last night. Your're feverish,:
I doubt, with the spring weather."" [
It wasn't much like spring to-day.
One of the sudden changes peculiar
to the fickle month of April had
taken place, and a cold breeze and
leaden cloulds replaced tho balmy
airs and sunny skies of yesterday. It
began to drizzle, too, as the family
arose from the breakfast table; and
a bleak and cheerless prospect was
presented without.
Hetty was glad that her mother
permitted her to go to her room and
lie down. There was never a fire in
her room; but she drew the bedclothes
over her head, and wished that she
could thus shut herself out from the
whole world. She felt forlorn and
miserable. All hor sweet foolish
dreams of love seemed to have been
rudely stricken at a blow. Walter
had ceased to care for her. He had
not been proos against a year's ab­
sence. He had been won from her
by that handsome, stylish girl from
Philadelphia; and Hetty hid her face
in her pillow, and almost wished she
could die.
It was the darkest day she had ov­
er known. She tried to read her bi­
ble, but could not fix her thoughts on
it, and closcd it in despair. She
listened to the dismal beat of the
slow falling rain, and at times
watched the swaying of the half­
budding tree branches in the chill
wind. The cherry tree before her
window had been yesterday whiten­
ing into blossom. Surely the cold
wind would kill the tender buds, and
there would be no fruit. How like
her own hopes and happiness!
Her mother sent for her to come
down to dinner. There was, she
said, no use in staying up stairs in
the cold, and the child would be bet­
ter by the fire, with some nice warm
soup. In there all the afternoon
Hetty sat, while her father and the
boys went to church?for it had
ceased raining now?and her mother
read ""Baxter's Rise and Progress""
and sang dismal hymns to the baby.
""Het,"" said Bill, upon his return
from church. ""I saw your old beau,
Mr. Walt. Hayos, at church with
Miss Mitchell, aud he shook hands

with me and asked how the family
was. She's a real swell, a regular
roarer, 1 tell you, and if you don't
shine up some, she'll cut you out""
J ""William, don't let me hear any
more such slang talk from you, I
Ih'P, said his mother reprovingly.
""And Hetty,"" said her little sister
Annie, as she carefully drew off and
folded her gloves, ""I heart Kate
Hayes tell Mrs. Green that Walter!
and Miss Mitchell were going back
to morrow to Philadelphia, and Mrs.
Green said Bhe supposed that was
one reason of his coming to River­
side that he might travel home with
her.""

Hi* Month Saved Him.

""John Hall, you were very drunk last
night,"" said his Honor, as a send-off.
""I think not, sir.""
""Well, you have a right to differ.
Officer, was this man drunk ?""
""He was, sir.""
""How drank?""

""Well, he fell down four times in
crossing the road, and tiie last time he
fell he settled down for a nap.""
""That's our case, Mr. Hall. Have
you any defense ?""
""I have, sir. I had not tasted any
liquor of any sort all day long. Just
before I met the officer I got choked,
and that was what ailed me when he
picked me up.""
'' Choked ! What with ?""

'' With an apple.""
"" Have you got it ?""
""Yes, sir. When the officer shook
me he shook the apple out of my gullet
and I put it in my pocket to bring and
show you.""
He thereupon polled from his coat­
tail pocket a frozen greening larger than
;i eotfee-cup and laid it on the desk.
4' Do you mean to tell me that you
had that apple in your mouth ?""
""Yes, sir. I was going to take a bite
when it slipped down into my gullet,
and if the officer hadn't given me a shake
I might have suffocated.""
""You can't get the apple into you?­
mouth! No such story will go down
here.""

""See here, Judge,"" and he opened a
mouth big enough to take in a quart
bowl, tossed in the apple, rattled it
around and dropped it into his hand
again with a smile of triumph.
""You may go,"" said his Honor, after
a long silence. "" With such a mouth as
that you'll eat more than you can earn
in any prison. Take your frozen apple
and go your way.""
""Thank you/ I'd like to bring my
brother in some di:y and let you see his
mouth. He can hold a pint 'of hickory­
nuts and siug a song at the same time.""

ibe mode of working between tbe two companies
is interesting. 'Ibe English Company first rev wed
tbe Greek text and the translation, examining to?
gether every ver?*? and every word. ? his was doue
ut the rateo! about lortv verses a day, and it took
six years to complete the lirst revision, As each
portion was completed copies wen? sent to tbe Amer?
lego Company. WOO in due course sent back their
criticisms nnd suggestions. ? bese were carefully
considered dnring the second revision, which occu?
pied two years and a half. As the various portions
ol the second revision were completed, tnei were
sent to America, and the Americans sent back lur­
thcr criticisms nnd soggeetions, which were m turn
carefully considered. At last the rev wed version was
sent over to America in its final form, and t be Anici -
?can brethren sent back in rotili ? a list of paseases
m which they record their preference for other ren?
derings than those adopted by tbe English Com?
pany. 'Illese, it is understood, will be found at the
end of the largo edition of the revised Now Testa?
ment to bo issued by the University presaos.
The meetings of tbe English Company began eoeb
day at 1J o'clock and closed at T, After prayer, the
minutes of tbe previous inceliti? were read and con?
firmed. A vent was then read troni the authorized
version. Any proposals for changes in the Creek
text were inaile,discussed and voted upon ; and then
any chantres in the renderings of the Knallst] trans?
lation. At. the titst revision a majority of the mem?
ben presen! decided all chantres. At the second io­
vision all these changes wen liable to be i< c >rt­
sub-red, and then no disputed change, either in the
Creek text or in tbo revised translation, Was affirmed
unless a majority of two-thirds of the. members

Pitl'v Kullyin? of Hie Common*.
[New York ?un ]
Sir. Jennings has, or course, a great deal to
tell us about William Pitt, the elder, that lion
or tLe Senate whom we are told the veteran
Walpole instinctively dreaded the moment he
heard his voice, and exclaimed, ""We mu3t muzrn
} terrible cornet or horse."" We need not
remind the reader that i he histrionic eiement
was conspicuous In Pitt, a\:d that K is precisely
' easectIaUy vulgar?jtagetricks
of speech and manner which his numerous imitators
from his own time to ours hive b -en
most anxious to reproduce. Some of his sallies
said to Lave b( en effective, are examples of the
c ose approach made to the ludicrous by theat|
rlcal strainings after the sublime. It is reI
lated tliat once in tlie liouse of commons ne
I began a speech with the words. ""Sugar, Mr.
i speaker, and then ob-ervlng a smlie to pre!
vaueJ-he audience, he paused, looked liercely
j round, and with a loud voice, rising la its
; ,sweI1'ng Into vehement an-er, he
. is said to have pronounced aga'n the word
I "" sugar"" three times, and having thus quelled
or ipVIt vSCt,aiJd ,ex 11 n^u'shed every semoiance
"" \uul u.iii [ ro""ua ?""Jd disdainfully asked,
ho will laugh at sugar now?"" The only
suggested by this anecdote is that
the house o. commons at that epoch must have
been curiously chicken- llvered and easily
another occasion Chatham seems

m| the case of Bottom the weaver, it was done
with nothing but roaring. Who,"" san^ out

S had sat down, he pointed to Lord
MansP.eld and said: ""is it jou? Methlaks
Felix trembles."" At another time Pitt fright
ened an inoffensive member out or his wlta by |
calling him to order in sepulchral tones, and
desiring that his words might be taken down,
the poor man stammered forth an apology I
paying that he meant nothing, but this did not
hinder I ltt from trampling on him with the
following p?ece ol bombastic impertinence: ' i
have, he said, "" a great regard for the honor- I
able member, and as an Instance or t hat regard.
I give him this advice: Whenever that member
means nothing, I recommend him to say
nothing."" it is refreshing in view of the exaggerated
homage paid in his life-time to the
elder Pitt, to tlnd that, once at least, his auditors
had the sense to see that a ilux of grandiloquent
languague might dlsgul3e a penury of
ideas. I ltt had made, it seem3, a very lone
and vehement speech in the privy council rel?
tlvetosome naval matters. Kvery one present
was struck by the force or his eloquence.
Lord Anson, on the other hand who was then
at the head of the admiralty, and differed entirely
in opinion from Mr Pitt, got up and
only said these words: ""My lords, Mr. secretary
is very eloquent, and has 3tated his
own opinion very plausibly. I am no orator.
aP, 3 . shall say is that he knows nothing at
all (it what lie liaa been talking about."" Tiila
short reply, coming fom a man of Anson's
professional skill, had such an effect that
they lmmediaaely voted against Pitt's proposaion.

OPPOSED TO CHIItUlI FAIRS.
No One Acrepts nus OHrer'? Chnllenjje?All
on (lie Same Side.
When ihe Rev. Miss Anna Oliver took charge
of the Wlllougby-avenue Methodls Kpiacopa
church. In Brooklyn, two years ago, she ac.
nounced in her opening sermon that she wa<
utterly opposed to the^ioldlng of church fairs
j and tlmllar projects to aid Christian
'churches financially, and that her chir:h
would got along without money gained
from such sources. A goo I tn iiy
; persons told her the church could not succee 1
! without such entertainments, and her friends
gave her one year in which to kill the
church. The reverend lady has constantly
maintained her doettine, and
the church Is not yet dead. Sotne
time ago it was announced that a debate would
; be held la Miss Olivers churjli last evening
on the question?""Is It Right to lloid
i Church Fairs:"" Churches ""believing la
: such things"" were invited to take th>
j affirmative, and the Willoughby avenue
J church was to take the negative. The meeting
was held In the chapel-room, and was
largely attended. After a number of Sandav
school songs htid been s ing. Miss Oliver Invited
any ministers that might be present, to take
; seats in the altar. No one responded. Miss
Oliver then announced that the Simpson, the
Nostrand-Avenue. and the Park-a venue
Methodist churheahad been specially lnvlud
to debate In favor of fairs. becauso thy had
just been holding such entertalnm -n'.s. an t it
was naturally supposed t hey upheld them. ? it
when a committee was seut to the autaorieh-3
ot theNostrand Avenue chureii tuev were informed
that tnat church did not believe in rairs, and
could not advocate them, although th -y
were holding one. Very much t he stm5 answer
was received from the Simpson ouareh
and the Park-avr-nue church, ali deeming
to take the affirmative on the qaevloa to
be debated. The Wllloughby Avenue church
was greatly astonished to tind falr-aoldlng
churches declining to support their o.vii practices,
and hesitated about having the debate.
But as the newspapers had announced tiie d<;- ,
i bate, atid as It was too late ""x> send oat a con ra- ;
diction, it was decided to go ahead and see
what would come ot it. ""Now,''continu al the
i pastor, -I don't see a single one of oar side
who agreed to take part in the debate to u'ght,
so If there are any persons here who would
like to speak in the afiinnatlve on th's question,
they have a fair Held and not a single
prepared speech agamst them. Bat we believe
i we are in the right and are rea# to meet any i
i arguments In favor of fairs. We will nave a
free discussion, but will take no vote, so that
j each one may form his own conclusions from
i the arguments. I ought to say."" add""d Miss
I Oliver, after a long pause, ""that if we have no
I lengthy debate we will have a spelling-bee an 1
, give a prize to the best scholar. We have had
i several such beea in our church and they have
greatly improved the spelling of our yoncg
folks.""
Miss Oliver sent a young man out to ^et a
dictionary, and then renewed t.he invitation to
any one desiring to support church ralrs. No
one responded. ""It ought to be understood,"" i
said the pastor, after watting some time, '-that t
we Include, under the term-falts,' oyster sua- !

theatrical entertainments, and the like in

the affirmative, don't hesitate to speak."" Tii?re
was another long season ot silence. Miss Oliver
went about in the audience and whlsperel to
several gentlemen, but each one s'look his
head, iluaiiy, an elderly gentleman, who
said his name was William Brown, of the
Dutch Reformed church in Twelfth street,
rose tip. ""I think,"" said he, ""we're pretty !
well united in thinking our sinter's aide is I
i correct, and, If our slsier has no objection, 1
I thlLk we had better sing the Doxology and
turn this meeting into a prayer-m etlng. i
want to bless God that there are so many here !
In Brooklyn who haven't bowed the knee to
Baal."" Mr, Brown began an earnest exhortation
to the audience, but M Iks Oliver lntt r.upted
him. ""Before we sing the Doxology,' stie said,
I want to ask again If there Is no one on the
affirmative side. Is there any one? It there is
only one present we would like to heir him, for
if the fairs are right we want to be convinced.""
This invitation wa9 greeted with the us ial
silence, and then Brother Montlgm.nl, of the
Park-avenue Primitive Methodist church, asked
permission to talk agalnat church fairs, and did j
so. He argued that such fairs did not promote I
holiness; that they drew young people away from
t he church, and drew the church Into such worldllnesa
that it was hard to distinguish between
Goo's house and places of amusement. ""Did i
t brls-t die."" said he, "" leaving us the example i
of fairs, ice-cream parties and tea parties to
support His church?"" He read au original ,
poem against fairs, and then the Itev. Mr.
Woodruff, of the Free Methodist church, said
the word of God settled the question, tor it i
said: ""Ye cannot serve God and mammon."" I
A fair was just the same whether it was got up
to serve the church or to sell rum. If we loved
these sensual fairs we could not be Christ's
disciples. Fairs fed the carnal heart and
worldly mind, and were antagonistic to God
and His work. Mr. Brown held that churches
ought to have faith in God for monev to run
them, and then Miss Oliver said she was glad
they were all opposed to church fairs. ""I
have given my reasons so many times,""
said she, ""that it Is not necessary to repeat i
them now. We will sing the Doxology, and
then we will have our speiiing-bee."" The spelling-bee
proved quite as Interesting to most of
the audience as the discussion had been.?x. r.

A Itacc Across the Plains.
In 1S59 St. Joseph was the western terminus ;
of railroad communication. Beyond the stagecoach
the saddle-horse and the ox-trains were 1
the only means of commerce and eommunlca- 1
Hon with the Reeky Mountains and the Pacific j
Slope. In the winter of ison there was a Wall- I
street lobby at Washington trying to get <
$5,000,000 for carrying the mail? overland one
year between New York and San Francisco.
The proposition was extremely ""cheeky,"" and
William H.Russell, backed by Secretary ot
War Fioyd, resolved to give the lobby a coid
shower-bath. He therefore offered to bet 1
$200,000 that he could put on a mall j
line from Sacramento to St. Joseph tnat '
should make the distance?1,930 mlle3?in 1
ten days. The bet was taken and the sth of i
April iixed upon as the day for starting. Mr.
Russel told his partner and general manager of
business upon the plains, .Mr. A. B. Miller, wuat i
he had done, and asked If he could pefofm the i
feat. Mr. Mtller replied: ""Yes, sir: I will do it, I
and do it by a pony express."" To accomplish
this Mr. Miller purchased 300 of the ileetest
horses he could tlnd in the west and employed
125 mem Eighty of these men were to be pose
riders. These he selected with reference to
their light weight and their known daring and
courage. It was very essential that the horses
should be loaded as lightly as possible. It was
necessary that some parts ot the route should
be run at the rate of twenty miles au hour.
The horses were stationed from ten to twenty
mllevapart, and each rider would b ? required
to ride sixty miles. For the change of animals
and the shifting of the malls two minutes were
allowed. Where there were no stage stations
at proper distances tents sufficient to hold one
man and two horses were provided. Indians
would sometimes give chase, but their cavu.se
ponies made but sorry show In their stem eha-,e
after Miller's thoroughbreds, many of which
could make a single mile in a minute and fifty
seconds.
Arrangements being completed, a signal gun
on the steamer at Sacramento proclaimed the
meridian of April s, lsoo?the hour for starting
?when Border Ruffian, Mr. Miller s private saddle
horse, with Billy Baker in the saddle,
bounded away towards the foot hills of tue
Werra Nevadas, and made his ride of twenty
miles in ferty-ntne minutes. The snows were
deep in the mountains, and one rider was lo3t
for several hours In a snow storm; and after
the Salt Lake valley was reached additional
speed became necessary to reach su Joseph on
time. From here on all went well until the
Platte was to be crossed at Julesburg. The
river was up and running rapidly, bat the
rider plunged his horse into the flood, only,
however, to mire in the quicksand and drown.
The courier succeeded in reaching the shore,
with his mall-bag in hand, and traveled ten
miles on toot to reach the next relay. Johnny
Fry, a popular rider of hl3 day, was to
make the tinlsh. He had sixty miles to ride,
with six horses to do It. When tbe last
courier arrived at the sixty-mile post, out from
St. Joseph, he was one hour behind time, a
heavy rain had set in and the roads were slippery.
Two hundred thousand dollars might
turn upon a single minute. Fry had ju3t t hree
hours and fhtrty minutes in which to win. This
was the finish of the longest race, tor the
largest stakes, ever run in America. When the
tin:e tor his arrival was nearly up, at least Ave
thou-and people stood upon th3 river bank,
with eyes turned toward the woods from which
the horse and its rider should emerge Into the
open country in the rear of Elwood ?one mile
from the fin'sh. Tick, tick, went thousands of
watches! The time was nearly up! But seven
minutes remained! Hark! a shout goes up from
the assembled multitude, ""He comes! he
comes!"" The noble little mare. Sylpn, the
daughter of little Arthur, darts 1 ke an arrow
from the bow and makes the run of the last
mile in one minute and Pfty seconds?landing
upon the ferrjboat with live minutes and a

In was down in the colon. Trtgg county. K v., a t
few years ago. George s. Wnarton'and the c
Hillmans are noted for their magnificent packet
hounds, acd. as the estate of the latter eousls's
of 50.000 acres of wild lands, all kinds of 1
game is abundant, foxes la piril-ular. '
.Matt. McKlnney. the most thorough sports' 1
man 1 ever met, and a kinsman of mine. '
furnished me with a mou it, and formed '
one of the party. As is the custom in this part '
of the coumry. we made a very early star.; the moon
was shining as bright aa day asotwge i
barton blew 1,1s horn at Matt s gate. lie was ,
followed by seme rliteen couple or as fine hou ids
as ever opened after garni'. Most of th*ai were \
of the English breed, though 1 noticed one sail- 1
tary long-bodied bow-legged beagle, wi h ears 1
nearly touching the ground. I askel Matt and I
Joel how was 1: that such a creature should be 1
allowed to accompany those otner tine dogs ?
lie laughed and sal J: ""That is ?h^ grandest ,
houi.d In America; we all ca'l hltn Akers, and

ectly up to my weight, and as highstrang as a
thoroughbred.
Foxea have a decided fondness nr yel'owlegged

frighten the fox If close by, but the moment
the 3ilp3 were removed I never listened 13 such
a chorus In my life: every on? of them seeded
intent upon finding scent. Koundan-l rouud
they rushed, among the thickets and weeds
then over the fence enclosing a held. Out no
tracks were found. j
Said I to Matt: ' Dag Afcera got to work !

-To be sure; there he goes now. with h ad
down and his'all almost dragging the irro ind.
He never spe'.aks unless he means business.""
on our right, and distant perhaps ttfty yards,
was a piece of woodland, and from that direction,
m a few minutes, came a long, d-vp n >wi,
as though the perpetrator of It was invoklag
the goddess Diana to favor his undertaki'ig. !

' Mat k him, <;eorge. and mtLd what I s ly. Fol low
him as long as your nag will hold up under

The other dogs scampered off after the beagle, ?
and we after thpm, but in less than a quarter ]
of a mile the cry of the pack ceased, an l we pulled
up. The moon was nearly do*vn, aud la

made, echoed and re echoed as th-y were >
smotg the hills, thrilled through my \ eH13 liko
sparkling wine; cares, tears, aud troubles were
101 gotten, and but one idea was left-to follow '
Akers.
The country was net very rough, though the .
ULdergiowih, fallen timber, and oec.ialoaal '
gullies kept me on the lookout. 1 at firs' ,
tLought that we were on the track of a red fox, j .
from the straight run he made; but, after running
Lim about an hour, I changed my opinion,
as ne now began doubling and dodging over so ;
small a piece of ground that I pulied up to it t
my horse take wind. It was now broad day- (
light, and I noticed that several of the neigh- 1
boring iariae-rs had come out to join me
chase; one of them, an old man with gray nalrs, 1
r> marked that lor upward of fifty years he 1
never let a pack of hounus pass or a dance
take place near his house without taking a
hand, and that he made ""jess as good craps as :
any body.""
Again iieynard started in a bee line, an l or
all the racing I ever saw this beat It; up hill
and down, now over a fence or foraln_r a creek,
tin ough briers and saplings, tearing my clot ties
until I v. a* nearly in a state of nature: but on j
we went. Being better mounted tnan they, I 1 ,
soon left my companions behind and was coa- j
gratuiatlr.g myself that bodily I had so far tar _\1 1
well, when zip, something struck me on the j
forehead; away went my wool hat, carrying
with It a scratch which 1 wore In those days. 1 '
could not stop, however, (the horse would not,
I should fay.) I found I was gaining on the
dogs, and tnat was sat inaction enough. How
far we had run 1 do not know; my horse was ?
beginning to show ratigue, and jet I had not *
caught the fox. In a few minutes more we
emerged from the woods, and 1 could see the
dcg3 crossing a ploughed field just ahead of me. 1
1 had to pass a little farm house, an I the war
the women standing In the door hallooed and :
'.auglied at me was a caution. One girl sal a:
""t'ome in here, mister, and I'll lend you a p ur
of dad's breeches.""
I paid no attention to them, but urged on mv 1
jaded steed until we struck the ab>ve mentioned
field. Here he let down. What was
1 to do? Fortunately, I saw ""Hancock""
ploughing.
said I: ""Let's swop horses, and 1 11 give you
t-5 to boot.""
""Good enough,"" said he, and 1 changed my j
saddle on to, not a horse, jut a mule.
I had never ridden one before, yet I deter- 1
mined to follow Akers and tieorge Whan on if
it cost me my neck. Again in the saddle, I 1
started afresh. On 1 went as fast as nis <
donkeyship would go. The young ploughmin 1
took the rever also, and behind 1113 ne came,
the collar and traces ot li'.3 harness jingling '
like sleigh bells.
""Daddy il raise old Cain about my swopping !
the mule,"" said he; ""so I'd jess as well take in i
the hunt and let One raising do for both."" As
soon as he came up my mule struck a livelier >
pace', and all w as going well, but the crv or the '
nounds was getting weaker; In ract, one or two
had dropped out, beat like my horse.
on and 011 we went, overtaking some more of ,
the pack, until finally none was left but Akers, j
and we seemed not more than half a mile be- 1
hind htm. He would bark, give a long yelp. !
and then be quiet for a few minutes. The ' 1
ploughboy said in his whole knowing of that
nound lie never heard him speau that way bo- ""
fore. There must be something up with him,
sure.
We had Just descended a very steep hill into 1
a narrow gorge, through which a brook rippled
its crystal-like water,and where the mule would
stop to drink. Here I saw a sight that some
reader ot this may question, but It Is nevertheless
so. e>ld Akers gave a cry similar to the one
made on finding scent In the morning. I looked
tor him, asthe sound was so close by; and there
he was tugging up the hill opposite to me, go- 1
lngln slow trot, and the fox, with his tall dragging
the earth not more than twenty yards in
iront of him. as tired as the dog. 11 nee red and
hurrahed, which stimulated old Akers to one
more effort, which ended in his catching Reynard
and 1 getting the brush. I then turn 1

How to lluy a Uonts
An old horseman, speaking or this subject,
says:?If you want to buy a horse, don't believe
your own brother. Take no man's word tor It.
Your eye la your market. Don't buy a horse in
harness. I nhltch him and take everything ofT
but the halter, and lead him around. If he has
a corn, or Is stiff, or has any other falling, you
can see It. Let him go by hlmseit a little ways,
and if he staves light into anything you mayknow
he's stone bund. No matter how clear
and bright his eyes are, he can't see any more
than a bat. Hack him up, too. some horses

A horse may look ever so nice, and go a mile a
minute, and yet have fits lor instance. There
isn't a live man could tell it till something
happens. Or he may have a weak back. GKe
him the whip and off he goes for a mile or two;
then, all of a sudden, he sits down on the road.
After a rest he gets uo and starts again, but he
soon siu, down tor good, and nothing but a derrick
could raise him.
Do jou know what a dummy is? You don't?
Well, I'll tell you. He's a horse that doesn't
know anything. His brain has gone wrong. A
dark stall an^ over-iecllng have ruined hla
digestion and that has ted his brain. Drive
him out a ways and pretty soon he will jerk his
head around and pull right straight on oue liua
You can't hold him; it's no use to try. The first
you know he has dumped you In a ditch or
smashed you up against a lamp-post. Tie him
in a stable and he'll bick up till he break3eve y

the end of tne stall so he can't back out and
he'll climb up the wall.
A Negro Boy'# Fortitude.
[kichmond (Va.) Dispatch. J
Quite a remarkable Instance of the fortitude
of a negro la related to have taken place at
Lj net burg recently. It appears that a few years
ago Frank Helmbolz shot a very young negro
boy. The ball struck the boy and InillJteda
severe wound, from which an entire paralysis
of one side resulted. The boy suffered intensely
at times, yet attempted to make a living, and as
many good people pitied hla helpless condition,
' he made a living by the sale of cake, confections
and matches. Last week, during the absence or 1
his mother, be undertook and accomplished the 1
eutlre amputation of hla paralyzed foot with a
small penknife and a pair of scissors. When ]
found he was insensible, but the foot was off
and the stump wrapped up In a rag and a paper .
bag. such as is used in wrapping confectionery. ,
Strange to relate, the boy began to improve
forthwith, and he has suffered but little since j
the amputation.

The latent application of paper is the adop?
tion of paper plate? by ?omo ot tbe great
restaurant? and cafes in Berlin. The innova?
tion waa first introduced during the summer of
laut year by tbe adventurous landlord of a
much-frequented open-air restaurant. Every
customer who ordered bread and butter, rolls,
cake?, buns, or similar article?, bad them
served to hirft upon a littlo paper plate, ma?le
ot a light papier nacht, adorned with ? pretty
bolder in relief, and having at the first glance a
great similarity to porcelain. Oneste, waiter?
and boat? were all pleased with the novelty ; it
saved the waiter? many a deduction fi<____their
wage? on account ot breakage?, which the
defteit and cleverest of Kellnert can scarcely
avoid when he bandle? hundred? of pieces of
crockery during u single afternoon and evening.
The paper platee were so cheap that the land?
lord did not care to asset hie ow nei ?hip over
them, and hi? cnetomera were allowed to cniry
them away, like the pretty seiviettea of thin
paper used in eo many restaurants in Holland.
There waa also a consiih<rahl? tawing of the
time lost, and the chance? of accident incurred,
in the cleansing ot earthenware pottery. Tbe
?uccess ol the experiment has been ?o marked,
that the new species of plates is likely to be iu­
troduoed loto a great number of restaurants.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1881-03-20/ed-1/seq-9,"","",9,"","",1,dlc_honda_ver01,"","","",true,ca,New-York tribune.,New York Tribune,New York [N.Y.],"","",6813,10672,2986,3706,9,19059,26856,0,dlc_honda_ver01/data/sn83030214/00175039831/1881032001/0685.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_honda_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn83030214%2F00175039831%2F1881032001%2F0685.jp2/pct:35.746891,39.737861,15.667139,13.799523/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/dlc_honda_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn83030214%2F00175039831%2F1881032001%2F0685.jp2/pct:35.746891,39.737861,15.667139,13.799523/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

The New Bible.
n„;A|. As previously announced. we propose
LIUICK WOrlC. fuily to meet tne demands of the
“M U ' *ini great army of friends of the Literary
Revolution for the new version of the New Testament,
which is now promised positively by the English pub­
lishers on the 17th of May. Our printers will put the
entire work into type inside of a few hours from the
time a copy can be procured, and we shall manufacture
at least 10,000 copies a day until the demand fori t is met.
IN CHAINS!
A few centuries ago the few Bibles in existence were
commonly chained in the churches and accessible only
to a few. Those who attempted to f ret* them, trans­
late them, and give them to the people, had the stake
and the scaffold for their reward. This now version of
the Testament was completed, printed and bound
months ago in England, but that the English publish­
ers might be able to monopolize its sale, and make a
thousand dollars the more, it has been
withheld from the public. The Copyright Law in Eng­
land is such that at least two newspapers, which, by
oonie method, secured copies of portions of it. and
published extracts,.with comments, were compelled to
desist from a repetition of the “ crime,” and to publicly
apologize for their “ wrong.” We are in favor of an
equitable international copyright law that will give
authors due reward for their labor, but Americans will
not care to see such an English law transferred to this
country.
On Majr 17th these monopolists promise to unbind the
“ chains ’ and release probably a million testaments to
the world. They promise one edition in very small type
in paper covers, at 15 cents per copy.
We propose to give, with speed never before equaled
in the history of publishing, in type of nearly double
the size used by them, the New Testament complete
for 10 cents, the Four Gospels complete for 7 cents,
the gospels separately, each for !J cents; and in many
various forms and styles up to full Turkey morocco,
gilt edges, for the new and old versions on pages facing
for 81.50.
GOOD WORK.
Remembering the past, our friends will not bo sur­
{irised that the publishers and booksellers who do not
ike the Literary Revolution are slandering in advance
our editions of this work, pretending that there will be
many errors, resulting from its hasty production. In
reply, we can only p romise to those who nave trusted us
and have not found us wanting, that it shall bo, typo­
graphically, one of the moot accurate works
ever printed on this continent. The printing
house of S. W. Green’s Son, Kos. 74 and 76 Beekman
street, which will do the work, has no superior m this
country in the character of its workmen, and no equal
in its ability to do good work quickly. They will take
double pains to do the best work possible, as this will
be, for their reputation, the moat important work they
have ever printed, and following them, our own pro->f­
readers and critical scholars engaged on our encyclo­
paedia will ah unite to make tnc work absolutely free
from error.
A FREE GOSPEL.
Furthermore, to demonstrate the superior quality of
our work, we propose to ..id, postpaid, free, to the
name of any person applying, by letter or postal
card, a complete, beautifully printed copy of the C>! os­
pel of St..l oh"". Only a single copy w ill be sent to
any applicant. We propose to print, if called for, a
million copies for gratuitous distribution. Persons who
would like this specimen in quantity) for distribu­
tion, will be supplied for the price of 50 cents per 100
copies, or at that rate for a larger number.
BIBLES IN 200 STYLES.
The religious public will be glad to know that about
July Ist we shall be prepared to offer them the latest
and most complete variety of Testaments and Biules
ever sold in this country, ranging from the smallest
Testament to most elaborate Teachers’ Bibles and the
largest Family and Pulpit Bibles at prices from U cents
fora single Gospel to 825 for the largest and best
quarto Bibles with illustrations and commentary. The
prices for all of them will be proportionately low with
our other incomparably cheap standard publications.
Full particulars, with specimens of the typography will
be ready soon, and will he sent free upon application.
loung’s Great Bible Concordance.
Onr new edition of this magnificent work, which may
fairly he called the ‘‘Webster’s Unabridged of Relig­
ious Literature,” is now ready. By its aid the unlearned
English reader is given ready access to the information
heretofore accessible only to those learned in the He­
brew and Greek languages, or by the aid of expensive
and often inaccessible Greek and Hebrew Lexicons
and Concordances. In connection with the new ver­
sion of the Bible, particularly, it proves especially in­
teresting and helpful, giving what no other work sup­
plies, cues to the considerations which have led
scholars to make the varying translations which have
been given to the world in the centuries past, enabling
the intelligent reader in large measure to decide tor
himself what is the meaning that will best satisfy his
own understanding and the demands of his own con­
science. Specimen pages sent free on request. Price
82.25; postage 37 cents.
5,000 Booksellers
Throughout the United States and Canada are pre­
pared to either abundantly supply, or liberally slander
our publications. We give liberal Terms to Clubs
where no bookseller acts as agent. Descriptive Cata­
logue, and illustrated pamphlet describing book-making
and type-setting by steam, will be sent free upon re­
quest. The following principal Booksellers of the

Kansas Citv, Mo., June IS.—The number
of dead bodies found in the Missouri River
at this point recently has given rise to a
suspicion that there Js an organized band of
thugs at work at some point on the river
above here. A few days ago the body of a
young woman, entirely nude, was taken out
of the current. Yesterday the headless
body of a man was found float­
ing, and to-day the body of
a man with his throat cut from ear to ear
was found floating a few miles below the

TREMOR OF ""GREAT ORA­
TORS.
It is a curious fact that great or­
ators seldom fail to be nervous
with apprehension, when about to
make an important speech. Luth­
er, to his last years, trembled when
he entered the pulpit. The same
is true of Robert Hall. Mr. Gough
confesses that he is always in a tre­
mor in coming before ah audience.
Many of the leaders of the house
of commons in England have giv­
en similar testimony.

Canning said he could always
tell in advance when ho was about
to make one of his best speeches
by a chill running through him,
caused by a fear of failure. Lord
Derby, the father of the present
Earl, when a young man, was one
of the most impressive speakers
in Parliment. lie was known as
the “Prince Rupert of debate,”
and seemed so self-possessed as to
be incapable of embarrassment.
But he said—
“ When I am going to speak,
my throat and lips are as dry as
those of a man who is going to be
O O
hanged.”
Tierney, whom Lord Macaulay
calls one of the most liuent debat­
ers ever known, said he never rose
iu parliment without feeling his
knees knock together. It is one
of the compensations of nature,
that the nervous temperament
which occasions the trembling is
also one of the causes of oratorical
success.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85033139/1881-06-23/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,whi_grace_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Manitowoc pilot.,Jeremiah Crowley,"Manitowoc, Wis.","","",6458,12472,2452,8150,4,22389,29118,0,whi_grace_ver01/data/sn85033139/00271769350/1881062301/0240.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manitowoc%2C_Wisconsin,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/whi_grace_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85033139%2F00271769350%2F1881062301%2F0240.jp2/pct:28.844522,42.832612,10.951807,27.989560/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/whi_grace_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn85033139%2F00271769350%2F1881062301%2F0240.jp2/pct:28.844522,42.832612,10.951807,27.989560/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Jintt-iial prints the following from Beauvior,
Harrison county, Mississippi:
July 5th, 1881.
Mr. Fdly S. Collins:
Dear Sir I have received yours of the
fourth instant and thank you for the kind
expressions it contained. The evil influ­
ences to which you refer as causing the
bitterness felt towards southern men it may
fairly be expected will give way to the
sober sense of the people if they shall like
yourself, detect a sordid motive for which.
the stimulants are administered, I will not
say I like the telegram you cite in regard to
the attempted assassination of the President
and say I am thankful that the assassin was
not a southern man, but will say I regret
that he is an American. The crime was
black enough in itself but has a deeper dye
from the mercenary motive which seems to
.have prompted it. I sincerely trust the
President may recover and that the startling
event will arouse the people to the consid­
eration of a remedy for the demoralization
which a wild hunt after office is creating.
With the best wishes for your welfare, I
am very truly yours.

The Champion Thief.
The Vienna correspondent of the London
Olobe says : ' 'Last week a certain Hungarian
countess, well known for her riches and
beauty (the same spirited lady who last year
seconded her brother in a duel), graced with
her presenoe the performance at the Aresa.
or summer theatre. On one of her fair fin­
gers my lady wore two splendid diamond
rings exactly like each other. During an
entr'acte there presented himself in her box a
big fellow in gorgeous livery six feet of the
Snest flunkey imaginable. Quoth he, in finest
Hungarian, 'My Mistress, Princess P .
has sent me to beg of your ladyship the loan
of one of your rings for five minutes. Her
iighness has observed them from her box
opposite, and is very anxious to examine one
more closely, as she wishes to have one made
after the pattern.' Without an instant's hesi­
tation, the countess handed a ring to 'Jeames, '
who bowed with respectful dignity and re­
tired. The performance over, the two great
ladies met on the staircase, and the countess
begged her friend to keep the ring at her
convenience. 'Whnt rag, my dear?' De­
nouement ! Tableau ! The 'powdered me­
nial was no flunkey at all. but a thief.
nd the ring was gone. The police were in
formed of the impudent trick. Justice seem
ed to have overtaken the culprit in a very
tew strides, for next morning the countess,
while still en robede chambre, received a let
ter informing her that the thief had been
caught and the ring found on his person,
'Only,'' added the note, the man stoutly de­
nies the charge and declares the ring to be
his own. To clear up all doubt, come at once
to the police station or send the duplicate
ring by bearer.' To draw the second ring
from the finger and intrust it joyfully to the
messenger a fine fellow in full police uni­
form together with a handsome 'tip' for the
glorious news, was the work of a moment.
Only when my lady an hour later betook her­
self radiant to the police station to recover
her jewels, a slight mistake came to light.
Well, my rings ? I could not come myself
the instant I got your letter.' 'What letter,
madame ?' Denouement ! Tableau No. 2 I
I'he thief had got them both.""

Another Book by Jiulgo Tourgoo,
In his Preface to ""A Jtoyul Gentle­
man"" which 1s to bo sold by subscript­
ion, tho author says:"" Tho trouble Is
that tho Northern man has made
up a South for himself, and, without
the least hesitation, criticises any de­
parture from tho orignal of his own
imagination as untrue to life. After I
wont South, tho contrast between these
pro-notions and what I saw of tho life
around me, Impressed me keenly, ami
soon became a subject of engrossing hi
tares. .
""I saw, or thought I saw, that tho
conscious ovlls of slavery -tho cruel
lash, the impossible task, and whatover
of opportunity fur umlico the system
gave rise to had been disproportion­
ately dwelt upon by tho anti-slavery
writers of tho North. At tho samo
time, the uneoiisrious evils of tho sys­
tem -those which warped tho brain
and heart of tho master as well as
dwarfed the soul of tho slave -had
been allowed to drop out of sight. I
noticed, too, that these unconscious
evils were tho very ones which had left
their marks upon character, and that
every one who had been subuunltted
to their Inlluences were more or less
scarred by them especially tho master
race; and that these inlluences were a
part of slaveiy which could bo 'abol­
ished.'""This book was written becauso Its in­
cidents, in effect hud passedJieforo my
oyes with such vividness that I could
not but write; it is a picture of acts.
Farther, it does not go nor lead.
""A Fool's Errand ami Tho Invisiblo
Empire"" depicts tho experience of a
Xorthern Settler in tho Southern States
during the period of Reconstruction.
""Bricks without Straw"" pictures tho
conditions and difficulties under which
tho Freedmen is trying to struggle up
from darkness into light. And now
""A Uojul Gentleman"" portrays, in a
novel ami graphic manner,, re rwwe­
tcristie elements, never before so clearly
analyzed and treated, namely tho
Southern view of the Rebellion ; tho Au­
tocratiaijluroholder, standing at the top
of the social scale; tho Poor WhiU,
then lying at the bottom, but now fast
climbing to the higher lovels; tho
typical Youny Southerner before, tin­
ring, and since tho war, together with
his relations personal, social, and le­
galwith tho typieal Stare tlirl of
beauty, Intelligence, and subsequent re­
llnomont, whoso charms ami virtues aro
alike tainted by the faint and indis­
tinguishable irace of slave blood in her
veins. It is a picturesque, vivid, and
passionate story, and there is that in
it which .will attract tho most cultiva­
ted ami fastidious.
It is said that Judge Tourgois books
reached, within a year, tlie enormous
sale of :t50,000 copies, the most rapid
sale in tho history of book-publishing.
His host, of readers will, wo predict,
llutl 'VI Jioyal (enth.i'.u"" the must

And those who have not yet had tho
pleasure of reading J utlgo Tourgeo's re­
markable books will do well to com­
mence with ""A Jioyal llentlnnuu,"" his­
torically the beyinninu of Hie scries.
The book is brilliantly illustrated.

to be made an essentl il p .rt of our ow n system, It

And under similar conditions, it may also ?* quo

Paris, Dec. 8. The committee en the
bill for the sale of the crown jewels In­
spected them yesterday. It is proposed te
retain an assortment, including certain
presents from foreign monarchs,
and a sword valued at 250,­
000 francs and possessing artistic value.
The committee are also disinclined te sell
the Regent diamond, fearing it would be
bought by enterprising Americans for ex­
hibition. They are in favor of disposing
of diamonds te the value of 12,000,000
francs possessing no historical value.

for the purpose of continuing the examina­

correspondence^ and Chairman Williams read
tiiJ following letter from Shepherd:
Richmond Hill, L. 1., March 17.—Sir: Ail
copies of the correspondence called for by the
committee were finished and packed last even­
lag, and my ticket was purchased for the lim­
ited express this morning. As soon, however,
as I left my office I was prostrated with an
acute attack of malarial fever, and nothing
like traveling is possible to-day. I shill re­
join the committee [here the members of the""
committee indulged in a hearty laugh]

me to do so, and my present hope is I may
be able to appear Tuesday morning. At pres­

moved that the committee report the matter
to the house and ask for a compulsory process.
Walker favored positive and prompt action.

""Washington, March —Col. Cook, in re­
signing as counsel of the star roHte cases, says
that up to the time of the assassination he had
frequent interviews with President GarSeld,
aad almost daily consultations with Mac-
Veaghj but it is evident his relation to the
cases has now become essentially changed.
Still this was to have been expected as he was
chosen by the late administration. Attorney
General Brewster in accepting the resignation,
says:

I did not think and I do not aow
believe that "" the position of counsel
in these cases had the remotest connection
■withany question of the political administra­
tion. They are public cases, not political
cases. They are pro bono publico. They
were confided to lawyers, not to politicians,
and hence I have had the control of (hem as
attorney general. I have treated them as pub­
lic cases, and I have been instructed by the
president to give them my vigilant attention,
and to Bee that they weie prosecuted with dil­
igence and with earnestness to a
practical result, and these instructions
I have before this, as an act of public
duty and as an act of personal duty to
him, made known and had at once done. I
c;nnot permit the implication, you appear to
raise by your reference to your having been
retained by the late administration to pass
without objection. You were not responsible
to any particular administration, nor were
tu.-.->e cases, or are to be confounded, or asso­
ciated with the policy supposed to be con­
nected with any administration. They are
substituted for the purpose of justice, and
justice only. They will be concluded by coun­
sel upon principles that regulate the adminis­
tration of justice, and not with reference to
the wishes or policies of any president no
matter what his name maybe.

Washington, March 18.—Commissioner
Fink concluded his argument today before
the house commerce committee against the
Reagan railroad bill. Inclosing the remarks
Ii? urged upon the committee the importance
of putting good men upon any commission
which congress might create. The Reagan
bill would simply disorganize and destroy the
system it is supposed to be designed to per­
fect. The best plan of all perhaps, would be
to have congress give to the existing railroad
commission the power of imposing penalties.
This would, in his opinion, settle the matter
it once.

MANIFESTATIONS OF FEAR.
It is said tliat the Emperor Charles the i
'ifth, reading an epitaph. ""Here lies one
rho never knew fear,"" remarked, ""then he
ever snuffed a candle with his fingers."" It
i certainly a somewhat absurd, though a faorite
claim for a popular hero, that ""he nevr
knew fear."" No one possessing human
erves and brain could say this with truth,
'hat a brave man never yields to the emotion
lay be true enough ; but to say that at no pe- '
iod of bis life he experienced fear is simply
npossible. As Lord Lytton expresses it:
""It shames man not to feel man'* mortal fear, j
It shauaee man only if that fear subdue."" J
There is a story of a young recruit in the i
'hirty Years' War going into action for the i
rst time in his life in the highest spirit: !
Look at Johann,"" remarked one of his com- i
ides as the troops were drawn up ready to i
large, ""he is full of jokes; how brave he is."" |
Not at all,"" replied the veteran addressed ; i

he knows nothing of what is coming. You
ad I, old comrades, are far braver ; we sit
;ill* on our horses, though we are terribly
Eraid.""
Fear certainly is one of the most irrational
E the passions. It is not always excited by
ye presence of danger. Men who can be cool
nd collected in cases of real peril will tremble
t some fanciful alarm. The Duke of Schomerg
could face an enemy with ready courage,
at fled from a room if he saw a cat in it. A
ery brave French officer fainted at the sight
E a mouse. The author of the ""Turkish Spy""
;ates that if he had a sword in his hand he
ould rather encounter a lion in the desert
jan be alone in a room with a spider. Many
eople have similar fanciful antipathies, which
rcite their fears in a manner real danger
ould be powerless to do. Fear of infection
i a dread that embitters the lives of many

dervish, who, knowing that the Plague

ith the disease that only a specified number

breach of contract by asserting ""Fear i

let him in the street pretended to discover the j

Where there are No Sunsets.
The following is Congressman Cox's
description of a scene at the North
Cape: ‘‘Herein the uppermost point
in Europe and at this midsummer sea­
son there is no sunset ! Bring burial
weeds and sable plume, for there is no
sunset! Lift the funeral song of woe
and tell through the land that sunset is
no more, and yet I live! And must I
now be disenchanted ? Do I live, and
is sunset no more ? Do I see a country
where the sun is going down, amid a
niise en ,scene equal, if not euperiqj, to
that Ohio evening years ago, which I
tried to portray with my poor pen, and
yet it does not go down ? Was it not
enough that for ten long days there was
no night for ns, and that the sun by
gliding and glowing in the north with­
out any respite had disturbed our cus­
tomary experiences? The reaction
might be too sudden. The failure of an
old orb to set might—well, there is no
telling the cataleptic and other dire con­
sequences. But here was the patent
fact; here were clouds and lights; all the
hues of the prism in splendid display,
and yet no sunset after all ! The un­
setting and unsetable sun ! Midnight,
and yet light all aglow ! No gas, no
candles, no stars, no moon—only the
fiery orb and Its traveling clouds of
glory.
“But is not the sun all-sufficient
without other fires? If he stays up
and sets not, what more can the human
heart desire ? What wonder that the
oriental mind clothed the sun with the
majesty of divinity, and that the Magi
saluted his coming with worship as the
source of life ? What wonder that his
beams evoked music from Memnon ? Is
he not the creator of health and the
great benefactor ? And we have found a
land where he will not rest!”

and propounded a few puzzling questions.
""Why is it,"" said he, ""that you are not able
to do the miracles that the apostles did?
They were protected against all poison l and
all kinds of perils ; how is it that yon are
not protected in the sarnie way ?"" . The col­

ful boy west of the Alleghanies. I
wouldn't look at a girl, much less
speak to a maiden ; but for all that, I
fell desperately in love with a sweet,
beautiful neighbor girl. It was a de­
ferable mutch ou both sides, and the
old folks saw the drift, aud fixed it up.
I thought I should die just thiuking
of it. I was a gawky, awkward coun­
try lout, about nineteen years old.
She was an intelligent, refined, and
fairly well educated girl, in a country
and at a time when the girls had su­
perior advantages, and were there­
fore superior in culture to the boys.
I rixed the day as far as I could have
it put off. I lay awake iu a cold per­
spiration, as the time drew near, and
shivered with agony as I thought of
the terrible ordeal.
""The dreadful day came. I went
through with the programme some­
how in a dazd, confused, mechanical
sort of way, like an automaton booby
through a supper where I could eat
nothing, and though such games as
'possum pie,' Sister Phoebe,' and all
that sort of thing. The guests oue by
one departed and my hai began, to
stand on end. Beyond the awful cur­
tain of Isis lay the terrible unknown.
My blood grew cold and boiled by
turns. I was in a fever and then an
ague, pale and flushed by turns. I
felt like fleeing to the woods, spending
the night in the barn, leaving for the
west never to return. I was deeply
devoted toSallie. I loved her harder
than a mule can kick ; but that dread­
ful ordeal I could not, I dared not
stand it. Finally the last guest was
gone, the bride retired, the family
gone to bed, and I was left alone ; hor­
ror of horrors, alone with the old man.
'John,' said he, 'you can take that
candle; you will find your room just
over this. Good nigh t John , and may
the Lord have mercy on your soul,'
and with a mischievous twinkle of
his fine gray eye the old man left the
room.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038603/1882-06-03/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,msar_lightningbolt_ver03,"","","",true,ca,The comet.,F.T.

Tantalized and then Murdered.
CniCAOO, June 13. An Atchison,
Kansas, special says: James MoIIahn
a section hand under E. L. Drown,
working thirty miles below LasVetaa.
being considered a balt-witted fellow,
was meroilessly tantalized and ridi
culed by his companions. He threat
ened, unless the abuse ceased, to kill
somebody, and eventually did shoot
John Graves, the leader, killing him
instantly. The section men therefore)
seized McHahn, and taking him to
the station and hoisted him on a cross
beam with a rope about his neck, and
let him drop 12 feet. The Coroner's
jury exonerated all parties.

Some persons can’t understand why
matches more now than they
did during the war, when everything
else was over fifty per cent, higher than
at present. It is easily explained. The
Delaware match crop was killed by the
cold winter that destroyed the peaches
there a year ago. The report that the
increase in price was caused by the war
in Egypt was a false alarm.—Norris­
town Herald.

There is a grocer iu a certain small
town in this State who has always been
called the stingiest man in Michigan,
and many gtoiksare atloat about his
breaking crackers in two and taking
oat pinches of dour to make exact
weight. It seems, however, that he
has been harshly judged. A few days
ago he had a lot of cranberries displayed
at the door, and a lady pedestrian
halted and aaked:
""Are thowe fresh?""
""Ob, yes.""
""Hew much a quart?""
""Twenty cents madam.""
""That's ten cents for a pint, five cents
for a gill, two and a half for half a gill,
one and thre« ""
""Did you want a quart?""
""Oh, iio. I was reading that coins
could be cared by binding on a split
cranberry. I have two corns, and one
berry would answer for both. I will
give you a cent for a single berry.""
'•Very well—take it along. Hold on.
I-et's see—let's see—yes, I can do it.
I'll throw in an extra berry, madacn,
and do both up in a parcel. I am

The value of the head is ascertained by

mount especially liue specimens of the
skull, but the greater number have no
ether value than that of the ivory they

The wages of the hunter depend, of
nourfie. unen his coetl fertune in finding

the game. One of the me.it expert of
these gives as instances of successful
hunts the items of three days' work which
yielded thirty-nine dollars aud seventy­
live cente ; of six days with a yield of
twenty dollars aud ten cents, and of
eight days' hunting which netted forty
dollars and twentv-tive cents.

Without speaking of these enemies of
the '""gator"" who hunt him for sport,
there are about two hundred men in the
Btate of Flerida who make a business and
trv te make a livinjr by capturing or kill

ing him. Very many have eaten alligator
steaks from simple curiosity te learn its
flavor; but many mete eat it bocause it is
thecheapest, aud, oftentimes, the only
meat they can afford. The flavor when it
is fried or broiled is that of beefsteak
plentifully supplied with fish gravy, while
the fore-legs roasted taste like a mixture
of chicken and tish, and have a delicate
flbre.
Tery methodical in his habits is the
alligator, and very suspicious of anything
new around his home. When he starts
out in search of feed it is invariably an
hour after the tide has begun te ebb, and
he returns about four hours after low

water. If he has a land journey te per­
form, he gees and comes by the same
rnnte. never deviation from it until he sees

evidence th.it strangers have trespassed en
his domain. He lives en the banks of
some stream, for he has decided objections
te stagnant water, aud te make his home
he digs a hele at least twelve inches below
the level of the water. This holt) is porper­
lectly straight, although en au incline,
and from twenty te thirty feet in length,
terminating iu a chamber sufficiently
large te admit of his turning iu it. Theto
he or she dwells alone, save when the
female is eariug for a very young breed,
in which case the one room is converted
into a nursery. Full-grown alligators net
only de net occupy the same hele, but
they will net live near each ether.
The alligator usually lays her eggs about
the first of July, and during the mouth of
June bhe is busily engaged iu preparing
the cradle for her young. Selecting a place

en the bauk of some stream or creek, she
begins work by beating hard and level
with her tail an earth platform about bix
feet square. She scrapes together with
her ferefeet, oftentimes from a distance
of fifty yards from the proposed nest, dried

grass, sticks auu niua uum uiteeu in
twenty cubic feet of the material is iu a
place ceuvcuieut for her purpose. On the
day following the completion of these
preparations she lays from thirty te fifty
eirffs en the iH-enared ground, and piles

ever them dried grass and mud deftly
worked iu with sticks until a mound six
feet in diameter aud three feet high has

been raised. The suiface of this is quick­
ly hardened by the sun, and iu order that
it may be as nearly air light as possible,
the female visits it each day, covering
with mud any crevices that may have ap
peared, as well as remodeliug such por­
tions as de net satisfy herseuse of beauty.
The erdiuary time of incubation is about
two months, aud then the newly-hatched
breed may be heard yelping and snarling
for their mother te continue her work by

releasing them from their prison uest. Uu
the secend or third day after the first uoise
has been heard, the fomale bites a hole iu
the 6ide of the mound, out of which the
vminrr ones, barelv mero than cloven

inches long, eome tumbling in the most
vigorous manner, crawling directly tow aid
the water. Until the young are three
years old the mother exercises a parental
care ever them, always remaining within
sound of their voices, net se much te pro­
tect them from their natural enemy, man,

as lrem their unnatural enemy mcn

When then the hunter finds a nest, he
carries the eggs home te hatch them,
where he can easily capture the breed if

the eggs are fresh or it the young iu tuem
are net mero than five inches long ; at any
ether stage they will net hatch if removed
and are of no value except for the shell.

The captured eggs are then packed in
straw as nearly as possible in the natural
way, and the yeuug may be thus hatched
out very successfully. One farmer reared
sixteen hundred and another a thousand

ately after coming out of the shell, but
they thrive best if given no feed for at
least three months.

THE SELFISH ITCXTER.
A Wolf having chased a Hunter across
fields and through forests for several miles,
at length had the mortification of seeing his
Trey escape him by climbing a tree.
“Are you coming down?” he asked as he
looked up and licked his chops.
“Not very fast?’
“I don't complain of that,” panted the
Wolf, ""but what hurts my feelings is the
fact that you didn’t climb a tree on the
start, finstend of giving me this useless
chase. Pray have some respect for other
people's feelings hereafter.”
THE HONEST CLERK.
A Merchant who felt that his Profits were
not as large as his trade warranted looked
over his books one Sunday and then inter­
viewed his clerk with:
“John Henry, you have taken 8500 of my
money since January.”
“That’s so. I used it to buy futures in
cotton, and I lost.”
“And 1 must send you to State Prisou!”
“Oh, no! Previous to January I took
$800 of your money and bought wheat, and
my profits have been so large that I can re­
turn all your money and have enough left to
buy a race horse. But for my honesty you
would have never known of the first steal.
But for mv business tact you would have
lost all. You’d better go visiting and give
me full charge!”","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83016025/1883-04-05/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,me_edgecomb_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Portland daily press.,N.A.

Fifty years ago few people knew much about 1
ventilation, or. Indeed, believed much in Its lm- 1
portance; and a crusade in favor ot ""fresh air"" '
was fought by the sanitarians. Now the tide j
runs the other way. and all the dull people have |
learned the phrase ""fresh* air,"" and insist on 1
having what they call ""fresh air"" at any cost, 1
and without regard to times and places. Two '
men will come into the spacious parlor of a f
club; the air. though warm, is much purer, and I
cooler by five degrees, than the furnace-blast '
of the streets that they have left. The incoui- 1
er^ are entirely comfortable until one of them w
notices that the windows are shut. Then they 11
remember the formula ""fresh air;"" the win- *
dows are ordered open; in comes the heated 1
gust from without, laden with the animal refuse 1
that forms the chief ingredient of the dust in a
our large cities. These intelligent gentlemen 1

really fine teeth pulled out and false ones
put in their place. I protested that it
would be foolish, silly, senselcss ; but she
said no, she would have them out, and if
I would net de it seme dentist would.
"" My teeth are net fashionable,"" said
she ; ""they are tee long, and short little
bread teeth like corn kernels are all the
fashion new and no one admires my mouth
and I will have them.' Se I made her the

couldn't see anyone for two weeks after I
pulled out her own. They were the upper
ones only, and I made them up with geld
plates for a handsome young fellow who
had his own teeth knocked out in a base­

General Sherman is one of tho most
popular men in Washington, judging by
the demand for bim at social entertain­
ments. He rarely, if ever, dines at home.
As he goes out so regularly, ho sometimes
forgets where he is to go. Tbe other night
he came out on his doorstep in a great
hurry. He wps in dinner dress, but
hesitated after he came out of the door.
Mrs. Sherman, who was in the hall, asked
what was the matter.
""By George,"" said tho General, ""I was
to go to dinner somewhere to-night, and to
save my blanked blessed life 1 have for­
gotten where.*""
Mrs. Sherman came to the door, and
pointing to old General Van Vliet, who
was going quietly up the street, said:
""There goes General Van Vliet He is
generally at dinners where you are invited.
You follow him and ga in where he does.""
""By George, what a splendid idea. I
can't miss it following that lead. Van
Vliet can bo trusted to smell out tbe dinner
places.""
Away sailed Tecumseh, and as he did not
return it was safe to conclude that he was
fortunate in finding the right place.

lieves in the theory of the German Dr. Koch

amount to a death sentence. .. ""Cease to feed

stages of consumption can be subdued by
outdoor exercise. He condemns the night
air superstitions, and recommends mountain
excursions, even to the extent of a three
months' tour under the disadvantages of in­
sufficient clothing and protracted fasts, as
certain to effect a core in a majority of cases.
He points out malnutrition of the lungs as
one of the primary causes of consumption,
and suggests fatty substances and sweet
cream as the best lung' food. A vocal effort,
he says, does not injure the respiratory or­
gans ; on the contrary it strengthens them,
and he thinks that consumptives should envy
cattle drivers, ""whose business gives them a
plausible' pretext for yelling."" Too many
clothes he considers harmful, whereby the
perspiration is forced back upon the body,
and the lungs have to do double work.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015483/1883-06-19/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,ct_elm_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Morning journal and courier.,J.B.

Chicago, July 9.?The Episcopal church controversy
which has grown out ot the high church
tendencies of Arthur Kltchle, pastor or the Church
of the Ascension, and which has already served to
dr.?w out a letter of protest from the bishop of this
diocese, had another sensational feature added to
It yesteruay. Hector Ritchie at the morning service
announced that at the conclusion of the
service a requiem mass would be said for the soul
of Daniel Fountain, who was drowned In Lake
Mich gan in the latter part of May. The announcement
of tne requiem mass was apparently such a
pronounced step toward Komanism as to cause
even the parishioners of the Church of the Ascension
to rebel who had hitherto stood by the pastor,
and oue-htlf the congregation left church. In
the meantime, at the request of the widow of
Daniel Fountain, the celebration of the m iss has
been postponed for a few days. It Is believed now
that the bishop will be compelled to order the trial
of the pastor for infringement of the church rules.

Reasons for Believing They Are Not
Inhabited*
Prof. McFarland, of the Ohio State University,
in the Sidereal Messenger for this month,
says:
Thirty years ago the question of the habitability
of the planets was widely, and, in some
Instances, intemperately discussed. Several
volumes were written, pro and con, the writers
mostly seeming to think that they had a direct
commission from on high to settle the - question
or to settle their opponents; which things they
proceeded then and there to do. And both sides
about equally forgot or disregarded the facts,
and, with great heat, argued on general principles.
An article In the June number of the Popular
Science Monthly entitled, ""The Cost of Life,""
and which was In part criticised in a late number
of the Messenger, is a kind of renewal of
the useless debate, and Is clothed in logic
equally conclusive as was that of the original
controversy. The points given lately touching
the weight of a man on Jupiter and on Mars
were intended as a part of the prool that those
planets are not habitable. To pass in review all
the points of error would require an article of
too great length for the pages of this journal;
so 1 shall confine myselt pretty closely to a few
of the more prominent ones.
The same author, speaking ot Mercury, says:
""With a temperature of. boiling water in the
frigid zones. and red-hot iron at the equator,""
etc.?therefore there can be no life on the planet.
But there Is no proof of any such temperature,
and In the nature of the case there can be none.
Wherefore the conclusions are of no force. The
error consists In virtually assuming that the climate
of a place depends solely on its distance
from the sun?whereas this is only one of #hunI
dred causes.
! It is well known that even in the torrid zone,
at an elevation of about three and one-half
miles, snow does not melt; that century after
century ""eternal"" snows whiten lofty peaks in
all latitudes.
The temperature of a place on the earth's surface
depends on many Influences, any one or
several of which may be greatly modified or annulled
by the others; so that there is no general
rule for climate.
As a part of the multitude of things to be
taken into consideration, as touching the matter
in hand, we may name tnese, viz: The latitude,
the elevation above the sea-level, the ocean currents,
the direction of the prevailing winds, the
presence and trend of mountain ranges, the
amount of vapor usual in the atmosphere, the
deirree of cloudiness, the quantity of rain and
snow-fall, the size of the body of land, the
amount of land in close proximity and its surroundings,
the nature of the soil, the amount
and kind ot vegetation, the density and height
of the atmosphere, the length of the day, the
obliquity of the sun's rays, and the thousand
and one other things which go to make up
the whole temperature and climate. Of the
greater part of these?Indeed, of almost every
one of them?as exhibited on other planets, it
Is absolutely impossible to know anything at
all; and, as a matter of course, no one can
speak intelligently ot the climate on any planet,
except our own. But should all these Items be
known, the further question arises whether it
is not possible that animated beings could live
in an environment totally unlike that which
surrounds us. The conclusion of the whole
matter, so far as astronomy and physics can
now tell, Is this: That the four large outer
planets have not sufficiently cooled down
to allow life on their surface, such as we see
on the earth; that Mars gives all telescopic and
stereoscopic probabilities of conditions compatible
with life as we see it; that the earth
certainly for millions of years has been covered
with multifarious life; that ot Venus and
Mercury we have no certain knowledge; and
that the satellites are pretty certainly not fitted
for such life as is on the earth; that. In particular,
our moon has no water and no atmosphere,
consequently no climate or vegetable life. If
the sun and the planets continually lose heat,
then there will come a time in the far future
when the snn Itself shall go out in everlasting
night, and the planets cool down so that the
""eternal snow"" would be hot compared with
the degree of cold throughout all space where

Among the confnsed mas3 who were strug­
gling and screaming was noticed a middle aged
man aud his wife. Their conduct was in mark­
ed contrast with that of the other passengers.
The panic which had seized the others was not
Bhared by them, bnt their blauched faces told
that they realized the peril which surrounded
them. Tno only movement of muscles or
nerves was that produced by the chilling at­
mosphere. They stood close together, their
hands clasped in each others.as if about to con­
template suicide together, and thus fulfill the
marital vow of standing by each other in the
varying tide of life’s fortunes and misfortunes.
As the wreck careened with the gale from one
side to the other, and while the spray and
waves were drenching them at every moment,
the husband turned and imprinted a kiss upon
the companion of his life, and while thus em­
braced a heavy sea broke over the wreck and
both were washed away and not seen after­
ward. Mr. Cook says the scene was one which

oot in its smallest diameter. At the ends
.nd in the side opposite the pntranco row
loorways connected the main room with
mailer rooms , the whole suite or dwell-
ng consisting of four apartments. Ono
if the smaller rooms had its floor oxca-
atcd to a depth of two or three foot bo-
ow those ot the ether rooms , nnd is sup-
> oscd to hnvo served the purpose of storo-
oem or cellar for the ancient occupant.
The other small rooms may have been
bod-rooms. A groove eighteen inches
deep by fifteen in width , extending from
io iloor of the main room up ono side of
ho shaft to the surface of the hill its
iottom filled with nshes and its sides
lackonod by smoke form the lire-place
ind chimney of the establishment.
Around the mouth of 4ho shaft a stone
, vall was found , forming by itsinclosuroa
kind of dooryard to the dwelling below.
The wall doubtless served the double
purpose of guarding against snow slides ,
which might otherwise fill up the rooms
and bury the occupants , and against the
accidental fall of an inhabitant into his
own or his neighbor's dwelling , upsetting
the dinner pot , and possibly breaking his
nock in the operation. Considerable debris -
bris was found in these ancientdwellings ,
nn examination of which led to the dis'
covory of curios , illustrating some of the
social and domestic customs of the ex­
tinct raco. Stone mauls and axes , implements
monts used in excavating the dwellings ,
pottery bearing a great variety of orna­
mentation , bone nwls and noodles of deli­
cate workmanship , the motate or ""family
grinding stone for grain , its well worn
surface indicating long use , shell and ob­
sidian ornaments , implements of wood ,
the uses of which wore undiscoverable ,
were amnng the trophies of the explora
tion. Search was made for a water­
course , or spring , but no appearance of
the existence of water in the neigh­
borhood during recent centuries was
discovered. There were signs of
intor-communicntion between this village
and a cliff city some fifteen miles distant ,
and also a now discovery , which indi­
cates the contemporaneous inhabitancy
of the two. This city , or rather cluster
of villages , occupied the sites 01 a canyon
which has recently been christened Wal­
nut canyon. It is an immense fissure in
tlio earth , with nothing above the gen­
eral level of the country to indicate its
existence to the traveler until ho stands
upon the side of its almost precipitous
brink. The Bides have boon Bullied by
storms and torrents , leaving shallow
cave-like places of great length at differ­
ent heights , along the bottoms of which ,
wherever the lodge furuished sufficient
area , dwellings in groups or singly wore
built. The season tvns well advanced
when thn place was reached , end only
little time was spout in its exploration.
All the ancient methods of approach had
boon long before * worn away , andaccess
to tlio nearest of the groups of houses
was a work of difficulty.
The group or village which was most
narrowly examined was about three-
quarters of n mile in length , and consist­
ed of a single row of houses , the com­
mon roar wall being the living rock ,
while the sides and fronts were made of
largo squared stones laid in clay. A narrow
street or pathway extended along the
entire front. Other nnd similar villages
could bo Been along the canyon for a dis­
tance of five milos.
Among the relics found there was a
wooden spindle whirl similar to those in
use by the Pu'eblons of the present time ,
but unlike them in the apparent manner
of its manufacture. Nothing indicating
thn use of metallic tools of any descrip
tion was discovered. The surface of the
wcod of which the whirl was formed had
apparently been charred and then ground
down to tne required aiza and shape by
rubbing it upon sandstone. A shaft of
reed similar to bamboo , a species on-
tircly unknown in that region at this time ,
still remained in the whirl ,
It had been broken by the ancient
workman aud neatly mended by winding
about it a piece of line twinu. The ends
of this twine being examined under the
microscope disclosed the fact that iU fiber
was very line humiin . hair. Articles of
wood corncobs , and even the perfect
grains of corn , walnuts , bonea of elk ,
antelope , and wolf , portions of wearing
apparel of a fabric resembling tlio mum­
my doth. of Egypt , but madu from mate­
rial unfamiliar to the explorers , and
other perishable articles were found in
abundance , buried iu the piles of debris ,
which partially filled these deserted
homes , nnd would at first thought seem
to indicato'Eomowhat recant inhabitancy.
On the other hand , however , the pre­
servative qualitiep of the ntinoaphoro of

thin region are remarkable , and it is the
belief of the explorers that centuries
hnvo elapsed since the last of the departed
races occupied those old cities and villages
as houaoi.
The absence of weapons of war , of
works of defense , other than such ai nro
constituted by the selection of almost in­
accessible localities , of temples or idols ,
of hieroglyphics or pictures , together
with the durability nnd solidity of the
dwellings , so different from anything to
bo found of the handiwork of existing
civilized races of that region , and the
wide extent of thcso ruins indicating the
existence of allied races covering largo
portions of the present territories of
Arizona , New Mexico , and Utah , as well
ns northern Mexico , ara the elements of
the problems involved in the origin ,
history , and disappearance of tlioso races
problems which seem no nearer solution
than whonCoronadonearly four hundred
years ago , made n rnid for the purpose of
conquest among those places nnd , through
his priests , gnvo to the world the first

Forty-four yearH ege the writer was
called in a professional capacity te a
rudely constructed leg eabln In the weeds,
10 miles east of this city. A tnale child
was born the first born of man aud wife
whose intelligence and gonernl cultiva
tien were tnueh iu udvauce of the society
in which they lived. They were deter­
miucd te make thomselves a home of
plenty iu the new oeuutry by thelr own
industry, having nothing but a quarter
section of geed laud and thelr housoheld
goods. They oaine from Clearment
county, Ohie, Threo neighbor wemcu wero
there, nnd after the llttle stranger was
dressed the mother, with blaek hair and
beautiful eyes, was asked te name the
boy. "" I waut te call him Walter, but It
Is nu uulueky name. My great grand­
father was named Walter, and he never
came home from the war fur Independence.
Theu iny husband's grandfather raa
named Walter, nud he went te tbe war of
1812 and he nover returned. His eldest
brether was iiarned Walter. He went te
sea aud we heard that he became a soldier
lu Eureiw, but he never returned. We de
net knew where any of thorn are buried.
Ne grave stone h mark their resting plaoes,
There is ue wur new, and I trust never
will he in ourllfe time in this country, nnd
I amlu favor of calllug him Walter, that
the old family name may be rotalued
among us. Twoutytwe years from that
time Walter bade Ids widowed mether
farewell te Jelu the aitny for the
defense of the union nud tbe home of hlu
childhood. He was a geed nud brave boy,
but was missing after the battle of Stoue
Rlver. All citerts te nain some traee of
his death and final rooting place proved
futile. Ne oue can tell where, when, or
hew he died, or who disposed of his re­
mains. His mether mourned the less of
her llrfit born, and often icgrotted that she
had named him Walter. A low years age
she dled at the old home. On her death
bed she satd : ' Bury me boglde my bus-

band en the hillside, and If Walter's grnve
Is evor found spend nil the cstate I leave,

A Case Without Hope.
John R. Booker, ol Macon, Ga., writes:
“In 1878 I was attacked by the most rave­
nous sort of cancerous sores, that ate
great holes into my flesh and spread rap­
idly over niy body. I received the very
best medical attention; was dosed with
mercury and potash until I was so crip­
pled with mercurial rheumatism that I
could scarcely hebble about; my throat
atul mouth were badly ulcerated; my hair
began to fall out. So wrecked was my
general health that I became a physical
ruin and my life was a burden. For a
long time I was bed-ridden, and my suf­
fering was so intense that I prayed for
death as a relief. 1 exhausted the whole
catalogue of patent medicines, in each
case following the directions religiously.
Each in turn &eemed to aggravate the
malady, and none of them benefited me in
any way. When life was apparently
hopeless'l commenced taking S. S. S. To
this Specific 1 owe iny life. In ten days I
commenced improving, and in a short
time was perfectly well. My hair has
grown out thick; my health and strength
have returned; the ulcers in my throat
and mouth are entirely cured; my appe­
tite has returned, and for the first time in
years I enjoy ray food. Every sore has
disappeared"" from my body. I weigh as
much as I ever did in my life, and am per­
fectly healthy in every way. The very
germs of the cancerous affliction are de­
stroyed. Xot only is the terrible malady
that was preying on my life, and which
everv one pronounced incurable, entirely
cured, but I am also relieved of the bad
effects of the mercury and potash mix­
tures that I was fed on for years.”

The Democrats have been busy circulating ru­
mors to the effect that Mr. Blaine is an owner in
the coal companies of the Hocking Valley, where
the strikes are in progress Hen. H. 8. Bundy
acquainted Mr, Blaine with these rumors, and
received the following reply, which effectually
disposes of all the chargee:
Bar IlaRgOR, Maine, July 22, 1864.
Dear Sir—ln answer to your recent favor I beg to
say that lam not and never have Wen the owner of
pay coal lands er Won tends, or tends of <usy character
whatever ip the Hocking Valley or in any other part

of Ohio. Nor'hare lat any time owned a share Os
stock in any coal, iron or land company in the State of
Ohio. Five years ago I loaned $12,500 to a member
of the Standard Coal Company, ami took the bonds of
the company as collateral. I shall be happy to trans­
fer the bonds to any gentleman who is ambitious to
pay the debt.
I am interested in coal lands in Pennsylvania and in
West Virginia, but there has never been the slightest
trouble with laboring men in aav enterprise with
which I have been connected. This, I believe, covers
all the points of your inquiry.
Very sincerely,
James G. Blaine.

trod lire ion of Firearm*.
Before the introduction of fire-arms
concealed weapohs for projecting mis j
| siles were very rare, though cross bows ,
evidently meant for that purpose have 1
| been preserved. With the use of fire-
I a!mß, however, concealed weapons be­
j came more numerous, the sudden dis­
charge of a volley of unknown' weapons
causing more fright and confusion than
damage. When the cavalry-pistol was
first introduced it was regarded as a
marvel of ingenuity, and won mnv
battles for the troops that employed j
t. In the early days of fire-arms
we find them combined with battle­
axes, pikes, swords, daggers and
even shields, though whether these
may be considered concealed weapons
may be a matter of doubt. In the Mu­
seum of Edinburgh there is a purse of
peculiar construction. Beneath the catch
there is a small, fiint-lock pistol, and by
turning certain buttons the pistol is pre­
pared for instant use, so that any one ac­
quainted with the secret can open the
purse without danger, but an explosion
is sure to follow an attempt in the ordi­
nary way. This purse is alluded to by
Sir Walter Scott in Rob Roy and a de­
scription of it given in full. The Tower
of London has twenty-one specimens of
shields with a pistol attachment in the
center, the pistol being a breech-loader
and slightly projecting from the center
of the shield so that it would
hardly be noticed by an enemy until
the discharge took place. A small hole
in the shieiu gave an opportunity for
taking aim, and while the weapon could
not have been very dangerous it must
have been terrifying to a knight to see
his antagonist's shield go off in this un­
expected manner. The Paris museum
has a sword arquebus, the sword being
straight and the pistol being alongside
of it and fired with a wheel-lock. The
tower collection has also a pike gun,
double-barreled, with a flint lock, to­
gether with a dagger pistol, the two
weapons being combined in one in a
remarkably ingenious manner, the pistol
being in the center of the dagger blade.
The Birmingham museum has a whip­
pistol, the barrel being concealed in the
stock of the whip, a flint lock having a
concealed trigger. It was used by
outlaws and also by postillions, many
specimens being preserved in the Paris
museums. The Germans had a peculiar
battle-axe with a pistol cunningly con­
cealed in the head of the axe, so that
the owner could shoot down his op­
ponent before the latter knew what
ailed him. Among these early weapons,
so large a number were breech-loaders
that it is quite remarkable that the fact
is not more generally known. Almost
the earliest cannon were breech-load­
ers. Many of the earliest portable fire- I
arms were of this pattern, and so
• large a number of the pistols that the
I notion ceases to be novel. Nor were
i haminerless guns unknown even before
! the days of percussion locks. The
| Tower of London contains a specimen
j of a haminerless gun made in the seven­
teenth century, which was far more of
an achievement for that day than the
most complex specimen of the kind can
be for us. In fact, among the early
long and heavy guns, the breech-loader
is the rule and not the exception, so
that even here there is nothing new, and
it may be safely affirmed that, in the
matter of fire-arms, so far as the prin­
ciples go, there is not one principle
known to the present generation that has
not been applied at least a hundred
times two centuries ago.—London Tele­

Washington Letter.
A prominent New York gentleman, who has
spent a couple of winters in Washington, said
to mo this morning: ""Do yon know lam per­
fectly fascinated with the social life of the cap­
ital. We have no real society in New York.
You go to any one of the clubs and you find
them in the possession of a lot of young insur­
ance agents, stock brokers and down town busi­
ness men. They talk nothing but stocks, petty
scandals and horses. Old men are regarded us
stupid, and literary or intellectual gen­
tlemen. who desire to discuss something
outside of tlie leading topics, are voheu
a nuisance. You go into general
society, aud you riU find it still worse. A man

or woman over thirty years of age has to sit ix a
corner. The young ""dancingdudes"" and the bodi
run everything. Here in Washington, literary
gentlemen, philanthropists, statesmen, historians
and the very best type of our leading people are
met everywhere. You have here the young
dancing people, too. but they are merely em­
ployed to fill in the gaps. They are not the fea­
ture of your society. Any one who has ever ex­
joyed a wiuter in Washington society could
never be satisfied with the society of any othoc
city in this country. It is the only town where
men of brains and position are not driven late
the back ground by the long-legged young meet
and the nimble-footed young women, the gradx­
ates of the dancing school.

""Don't joke, Dan. I'm a little sore
on the subject of my poverty.""
""I am not joking,"" replied Dan,
snapping a spring with his finger
""what do you think of that?"" And
he handed him a little blue velvet
case. Will's eyes widened.
""Phew! how did you manage that
on seventy-five a month It's beau­
ty.""

Andrews chuckled.
""You like it?""
""I should say so. How would
stones like that do for earrings
""O, let up, Dan. ""Where's the use
of talking about it That's a carat,
isn't it?""
""Right you are. But you can get
the same you wish.""
""O, some installment scheme, I sup­
pose?""

Andrews restored the ring to its
case and the case to his pocket.
""Not exactly.""

And be forthwith proceeded to ex­
plain.
That night Mayrell said to bis wife

""I'll try and manage it, Dot.""
""What? Not the earrings?""
""Yea.""
""O, you darling!""
And the very next day he brought
them up.

Didn't they sparkle on their bed of
snowy velvet, though? And weren't
they beauties Actually larger than
Mrs. Kinsley's, too.
""I'm glad you like them, Dora.""
""Like them!""

And her eyes were brighter than^the
gems.
And maybe she didn't rejoice in
them and keep them wrapped in cham­
ois skin when not in usp. And per­
haps she didn't return Mrs.' Kinsley's
visit. If you think she wore a poke
bonnet or avail you're mistaken.

And for one whole month home was
a paradise of serenity for Will May­
rell. But one day, going out in a hur-

Dora hastily put in her earrings.
She could not have fastened them se­
curely, for on her return she found
herself minus one.

Of her grief, distraction, who could
write? Straightway down-town went
she and advertised in all the dailies.
But shedid not give her real name and
address. She must not let Will know
till it had been recovered. He would
feel so badly about it. No, no, she
would conceal the fact of her loss from
him till she could tell him of her re­
possession in the same breath. She
offered $15 reward, and came home
fagged and heartsick. But day by day
passed and never a word came there
of the missing iewel. She staid at
the house altogether now. She had no
heart for shopping or calls.

Her hope of ever recovering her
precious earring grew fainter daily.
She could not bear to look at the
poor lonely one laid so carefully
away.

Going out to the theater with Will
one evening he said suddenly:
""Why, Dora, you haven't got your
earrings in. Are you tired of them al­
ready
""O no!"" she exclaimed,with a feverish
laugh, ""but I can't- wait for them.
Come, I do hate to be late.""

And Will, having read the oft-re­
peated advertisements and noticed
the unadorned pink ears, had come to
his own conclusion. But he only
smiled and was silent—except for this
one reference to divert suspicion—like
the wise fellow he was. And when two
weeks had ]Assed and doubt begun to
settle into despair little Mrs. Mayrell
began to wonder if she could by any
economical strain replace the lost
trinket unknown to Will. St might
have managed it if they had not been
such very brilliant stones, and so
large, too. They must be worth an
enormous sum! How Will had man­
aged to get them in the first place
rather puzzled and frightened her when
she let herself think of it, but then Will
always did things on a grand scale
when he made gifts at all.

They must be worth three hundred
at least. Several had valued them at
that—none at less. She would take
the one in her dressing-case down to
Mackin, the chief jeweler, tell him of
her loss, and learn from him the lowest
sum at which it could be replaced.

And this the very next day she did.
Mr. Mackin examined the earring as
she falteringly inquired what one ex­
actly like it would be worth. ""Two
fifty, madam.""

Ah, even more than she thought!

""Two hundred and fifty! That is a
great deal!"" she murmured.
He looked at her blankly. ""Two
dollars and fifty cents, madam. We
don't keep such stones, but we can
have your missing earring replaced foi?
that sum.""

And then, observing her pallor and
divining the truth he kindly and po­
litely turned his back on her.

Over the scene which followed at
home turn low the lights, ring down
the curtain.

But raise it again for a moment!
It is two weeks since Mrs. Will May­
rell met her husband with a face
which told him his scheme had found
him out.

He comes in now and hands her a
paper, pointing out a paragraph as
he does so, and this is what shereads:

NEW YORK.—[Special to the Tribune.]­
George Kinsley of Chicago, who arrived in
this city yesterday, was arrested to-day for
embezzlement as be was about to board
the steamship Servia. His books show a
deficit of $9,000, taken, as is credibly as­
serted. to gratify his wife's extravagant de­
mands. He managed to avoid suspicion
up to the day of leaving. He swallowed
strychnine and died within the hour.

With a very white face Dora laid
down the paper. Will took her in his
arms. ""Darling,"" he said quietly,
""that was the only other course left
open to me.""
""O, Will!""
""You forgive me now, dear?""

She was shaking from head to feet.
She began to cry softly.
""Not that, Will. You forgive me.
I didn't know—I didn't think

He kissed her tenderly.
""Of course not, sweetheart. But we
can do without diamonds better than
without honor or each other, can't
we?""
""Yes, yes!"" she cried, and clung to
him. But the tears had washed away
the old selfishness and envy, and with
her smile of love began a grander,
fairer womanhood.

Snakes tn the Peqjdeh Valley.
[From the London Times.]
Remittent fever has of late years
played sad havoc among the Jam­
shidisof Kushk. All the neighboring
valleys, including Penjdeh, are infected,
and are only habitable^ in spring and
summer by the acclimatized. Another
drawback to this valley is the number
of snakes which infest it. In spring
the country must swarm with them
at present they are to be found, when
there is occasion to dig, some eighteen
inches or two feet below the surface,
hibernating in sleepy torpor.

Before winter closed in one of the
Lancers—a strong, healthy young fel­
low—very nearly fell a victim to one
of these reptiles. When picking up a
stone he was bit in the back of the
hand, and he owed his life to his own
prompt presence of mind and Dr.
Charles' care and skill. Tearing off
a strip of his turban he bound it tight­
ly—so tightly that in the hospital they
could not tighten it—round the arm
above the wrist. He then made off
for the hospital, and half an hour after
being bitten he was under Dr. Charles'
care. But already there were signs of
paralysis in the left leg, and this grad­
ually spread till both extremities were
completely paralyzed. He suffered
from great heat, followed by intense
cold, tingling and numbness in the
arms and legs, and much pain over
the heart—his heart was ""on fire"" he
complained.

Altogether his case, after an hour or
so, seemed hopeless. He was plied with
brandy and ammonia, and made to
walk till his legs were deadened by
paralysis, and then he was put be­
tween hot blankets and hot bricks
were applied to his feet. Hypodermic
injection of ether was found very use­
ful, and at last, after three hours of
unremitting care, he slowly passed out
of danger, and Dr. Charles has the
satisfaction of being one of the few
who have sucessfnlly treated a snake
bite. However the man did not com­
pletely recover at once. He suffered
from blood poisoning, and it was three
weeks before he was discharged from

Value of the Manure from Fattening Animals.

The value of Hie manure from fatten­
ing animals is a matter less within the
positive knowledge ol the a eragc farmer
than should be the ca-e. Tlieelfcctof
different kinds of feed on the value of
manure is also a matter not so thor­
oughly appreciate;! as would be for tho
advantage of fanners. .'.Inch of tho
feeding, so far :n the value of the ma­
nure i.s concerned, is a; haphazard.
Farmers eau generally give some id,
as to the best feed for the production r.I
pork, beef and mutton. By the feed­
ing of so much corn, hay, oats or bai­
ley they expect to make a cert:. in in:.-. li
tity ot meat, hut how nine!
lt how much t he :a:i
nurc from this will bo worth is to m.viv
an unsolved and often an unthoiighl of
problem.
The truth is that the value of the ma­
nure from a top of some kinds of feed
i.s a much more certain quantity than
the weight of meat, that it will pro..,ce.

that, too, while ,iving kinds of feed
that are excllent for making fat and
flesh. Wo have !o-t much iu this conn; ry
from our in:'.tt""i!t ion to this point, while,
England lias profited by the popular
ignorance prevailing in liii- and otl.e:'
coiiuLr'es of the varieties of feed essen­
tial to making the richest kinds of
manures. .Many years ago Sir John li.
Lawes published tables showing the
comparative alih! of manures mad:;
from a ton of the various kinds of food.
Linseed cake and cotton-seed cake -land
at the head of the list, and it is a note­
worthy fact that for very many years
these oilcakes were the stuitle food for
fattening beef cati'.e.
In this country fully three-fourths of
the food gioli to fattening, or other
stock, is cori. It does not become 1:3
to speak against corn. Crowing and
feeding it largely are e idenccs of im­
proved fanning. We rather exalt our­
selves on the fact, that farmers here can
grow corn, while tlue in England can
not. But, after all. corn is pot among
the more valuable feeds for manure,
especially on lands requiring phos­
phates, as most of our long cultivated
soils do. What has been called the
English farmer's prejudice against feed-
I ""'J? corn is possimy a lvemguition 01
tins tact. According to .Mr. l.awev
tables, based' on values in England, the
manure from a ton of Indian c i:n meal
can be worth only sii.iio. That from
ton of linseed cake is worth ?1'J.7'.',
from beans .lo.fi.j,. and from peas
lo.7o. Tho manure from a Ion of
clover hay is worth :.()."", while that
from coarse to fine ivheaf middlings
varies from Sl.'l.jj.'i to isl l..r)0. These
figures are very suggestive. They
show not only that many kinds of feed
have more value as manure than cor.i.
but that some of these are worth ir.o''e
for the manure alone than the money
value of their cost. It is notuncommon
to have wheat bran selling very
near to what it is worth as manure even
in the East. At the West it can often
ho purchased for IU or Ifd 1 per ton
tho tall. It must be remembered that
the above figures are made in England,
vet the matter of comparative values is
equally uj'plieablo hero. N. Y. Herald.

Falling Half a Mile With a Parachute.
From the Philadelphia Times.
The greatest balloon feat I ever witnessed was
In September, 1857. Upward of 15,000 people
were at Lemon Hill and along the banks of
the Schuylkill to see Monsieur Godard go up in
a balloon along with his brother aud drop the
latter out from among the clouds in a parachute.
It Is said that the feat had never been
attempted before in the history of ballooning;
it was a startling novelty, aud the people
crowded to see It. When the balloon sailed
gracefully upward outside of the enclosure
Monsieur Godard and two friends were in the
babket, while below it Monsieur E. Godard, his
brother, was seated upou a small bar of wood
attached to the parachute. It looked like au
Immense umbrella. The balloon went over the
Schuylkill in a southwesterly direction, and
after it had reached an altitude of about six
thousand feet began to slowly descend. Then
the parachute began to expand. When
within ^ibout three thousand feet of the
earth the cord was cut and the parachute rapidly
descended, with Godard hanging on to the bar.
The balloon shot upward again. The descent
of the parachute was keenly watched by the
thousands of spectators, and mauy expected to
see the daring man dashed to the earth in the
twinkling of an eye. It was observed, however,
that the nearer to earth the parachute came the
descent was slow and easy. At'last the man
and his big umbrella laded out of sight over the
hills, and we learned next morning that he came
dowu all right on his feet, like a cat, about a
haif-mile west of the old Bell tavern, on the
Darby road. The balloon landed iu Delaware
county, near the Philadelphia line. Godard
and his brother were Frenchmen. They returned
to their uatlve country, and, I believe,
were valuable to their countrymen during the
Franco-Prussian war. Gambctta sailed out of
Paris to Tours in one of their balloons.""

but the student, now a youthful

A jam of logs in the Kennebec River
defied all efforts of the lumbermen to
break it. Lumbermen climbed out to
the head of the jam and deposited a
large quantity of dynamite which was
connected by wire with % battery on
shore. The gates at the dimt 'at Indian
Pond were opened and a head of ten feet
suddenly poured down through the ▼al­
ley. The great pile of logs creaked and
twisted, but did not start until an elec­
tric button on shore was touched. There
was a tremendous explosion. Logs flew
high As the air, and a sudden shower of
splinters fell for acres around. The jam
started en masse down the valley. There
was a strange cradling and rumbling
that grew into a roar aa the Immense
body gathered speed. The current runs
at sixteen miles aa hour for a long dis­
tance below where the blockade occurred
and the logs, moving as a solid body,
gained nearly that speed. It was a
strange sight. No water was to be seen,
and the great blaek avalanche, rushing
through the valley with an unearthly
roar, presented a spectacle which those
who witnessed it will long remember.
Lumbermen say there were fully fourteen
million logs in the drive as it finally
swept down stream. After the mass got
in motion it stretched ont so that its
height above the water was about twenty
I feet, many of the logs riding down in an
upright position. Many logs caught
upon rocks and projections, and were
broken or ground to pieces.
In Baltimore Frank Pyers, convicted
of brutally beating his wife and sen­
tenced to fifteen lashes and six months
in jail, received the corporal portion of
his punishment. He stood the ordeal
with considerable coolness and nerve, al­
though blood oofced from the heavy
blows of the cowhide. When brought
from his cell he walked to the whipping
post, mounted the platform and facili­
tated the work of the deputies by plac­
ing himself in position so they* could
fasten the iron clamps with ease. When
Sheriff Airey stepped upon the platform
the wife beater pressed his heaa against
the upright, closed his eyes and clenchod
his teeth. He received the first two
blows from the four foot cowhide with­
out moving. At the third stroke, how­
ever, his knees began to tremble, but,
perceiving his weakness, he straightened
up and did not move a nerve until the
tenth blow was struck. This encircled
his neck and tore the flesh on the right
breast. Then Pyers began to shake and
tremble all over and could not recover
himself. The whipping took but six­
'fceen seconds, and when the fifteenth
blow was struck the man was immedi­
ately released. He walked without sup-
Sort to his cell. While being attended
y Dr. Hoopman he exclaimed, “This
is hard treatment for a white man.”
Brazil buys from the United States
$5,000,000 to $6,000,000 worth of flour
in a year. American exporters, when
flour is cheap, as it is now, occasionally
send largely increased quantities, and
expect that a market will be made for it.
Its cheapness, however, seems hardly to
make a difference in the quantity con­
sumed. Some 30,000 barrels a month
are consumed at Rio and its dependent
markets, and it seems almost impossible
to increase this. At Rio the bread is
made by bakers; it is of good quality
and is eaten by all classes. The great
obstacle in expanding consumption is the
lack of internal transportation, and the
fact that the mass of the people have
never been accustomed to use flour, they
being satisfied with the flour made from
the m&nioca root, and which they habit­
ually eat mixed with their stewed black
beans and dried beef. A large part of
the interior peculation produce and buy
but little. They live in a primitive
manner, in cheap dwellings with thatched
roofs and earthen floors, sleep in ham­
mocks, use but the scantiest articles of
furniture, and even convey their food to
their mouths with their fingers.
A practical joke played upon a
Croatian peasant has nearly caused the
destruction of the chemical laboratory of
the University of Agram. The [peasant,
who was coming with his wife into
Agram, separated from her, agreeing to
meet her a few hours later at a certain
place. As she delayed her return, he ex­
pressed his anxiety to a bystander, who
told him, in jest, that his wife had prob­
ably been kidnapped by the university
vivisectors, who made it their business
to cut up women mid children. The
wife came up soon afterward and went
home with her husband; but the latter
Seated what he had heard, and the re­
ts have been most serious. Chi Whit- ■
Sunday an infuriated mob of peasants at­
tacked the laboratory, crying : “Down
with the hell kitchen!” and had to be
driven off by soldiers. The university
has since been watched every day by
evil-disposed crowds, and there was an­
other attack on the succeeding Sunday.
All the servants of the university have
left their situations, and the professors
have had to ask for police protection,
being in terror of their lives.
A sergeant-major, named Ebrard, of
the Fifteenth French army corps, four
years ago embezzled some of the funds
placed in his charge, and lost all at
Monaco. He ran away, took the name
of Antoine Vomer, enlisted in the
foreign legion, and volunteered for Ton­
quin. He was wounded at Chu and lost
his left arm. He received the medal.
Subsequently he was on the point of
being proposed for the cross of honor for
special acts of bravery, when one of his
former subordinates recognized him mid
denounced him. On being arrested he
admitted his guilt, and was taken back
to France on board a transport ship. His
trial excited a great deal of interest. His
lawyer pleaded for his acquittal on the
novel ground that his glorious exploits
had wiped away his former crime, mid
the court martial, after a few minutes''
deliberation, unanimously acquitted him.
The announcement of his acquittal was
hailed with joy by the sympathetic
crowd which attended his trial, and with
shouts of “Finek FhmasF*

Oris account: “Hicks Pasha aad the
very few English officers left with him,
seeing all hopes of restoring order gone,
spurred their horses aad sprang out of
the confused mass of wounded, dead
and dying. These officers fired their re­
volvers, clearing a space for themselves,
till all their ammunition was expended.
They killed many. They had got dear

and fought till they fell. Hicks Pasha

• Arabs. They said he never struck a
i main with his sword without killing

Dougai, the heavy armed (or thick or

and he dropped his Own. He then fell.”
The Journal of Inebriety thinks that
the cumulative action of alcohol on toe
; brain centers exists to a greater extent
, than is generally supposed. Many men
who drink regularly through the day and
| seem no worse for it, become intoxicated !
! late at night, although they have not \
■ used spirits during the evening. “It
' appears,” says the editor, “that alcohol,
1 like bromide, may remain in the system
to some extent without producing any ’
marked action, and then suddenly, from j
some unknown cause, burst Into great
activity, ’ producing profound intoxica­
tion.” The reasons for this do not seem
to be definitely understood, though they
are thought to be of a combined physio­
logical and psychological nature, and
partly due to climatic conditions.
A woman in a street car in Chicago,
gave her infant a severe slapping to
make it quit crying. She perhaps did
that to show the passengers what a pro­
found respect she had for law, order, ;
discipline, and submission. The infant |
was about three months of age. In a
few years it will say: “There is no
{>lace like home,” and will hasten to
eave it for that reason.
One of toe most singular, most amus­
ing, and at the same time, for the vic­
tims, most annoying robberies, occurred
in South Bend, Indiana. Two elderly !
ladies on Michigan street were looking 1
at the circus procession pass by. So in­
tent were they in gazing upon the daz­
zling pageant that not only their eyes
but their mouths were wide open, and
while in this awe-struck condition they
were each startled by the slap of a rough ;
hand over their mouths. Of course they
were mad, and look around with great
indignation to see who could be guilty 1
of such a rude act, and it was not until J
they attempted to speak, in order to
properly express their wrath, that they j
discovered their false teeth were gone. |
The thieves had looked into their wide­
open mouths, and saw that the plates j
containing the teeth were of gold, and
they wanted them.
While Clarence Williams, of Wells­
ville, Ohio, an aeronaut connected with
a circus, was seated in his balloon pre­
pared to begin an ascension, at Charles­
town, W. Va., the men who were hold­
ing toe ropes allowed toe balloon to
make a lurch, when it came in contact
wilh the fire of a furnace beneath it,
used for generating the gas. The balloon
became at once ignited, and in their
fright toe men holding the ropes let
them go, and the balloon immediately
shot up in the air. When a short dis­
tance up the crowd yelled, “Jump,” but
Williams did not heed the advice, and
after going several hundred feet up the
balloon collapsed, and he fell to toe
ground a lifeless mass of humanity.
Williams was twenty-two years old, and
leaves a wife and family. It was his
first ascension. The balloon was totally
consumed by fire.
lowa ranks the highest of all toe
States in the number of cattle to the
square mile. She has 2,014,484 head, or
35.9 head per square mile. Illinois has
1,471,191 head, or 26 head per square
mile. Ohio has 1,017,820 head, or 24.8
head per square mile. Pennsylvania has
875,994 head, or 19.3 head per srfiiare
mile. New York has 877,181 head, or
18 head per square mile. Texas has the
surprising number of 2,234,923 head, or
15.9 head per square mile. This is the
lowest ratio per square mile, although
the largest number of cattle of any State
in the Union—about as many as ail
France possesses. For all the States and
Territories the cattle population is 42,-
547,307 head, or 8 heaa per square mile.
It is interesting, says an exchange, to
watch toe various kinds of fish’at the
foot of a dam in their efforts to get up
a river. Schools of alewives flit about
the pool dodging restlesslp here and
there. Huge salmon calmly inspect the
impediment in the shape of a solid stone
wall that bars their progress, while the
repulsive-looking eel carefully inspects
each crack and crevice. This latter fish
has a peculiar way of retaining a de­
sired position in swift running water.
He settles on some sharp rock, faces up
stream, and making a hook of the head
■And forward part of the body, drops it
over toe upper side of the rock and takes
his ease.
No man has a right to read on a mov­
ing vehicle if his injured eyesight may
be transmitted to his posterity. The
harm done to some people’s eyes by toe
common practice of reading in the street
cars is almost beyond belief. The rapid
increase in the number of children wear­
ing spectacles in the public schools is a
matter for immediate scientific inquiry.
The usefulness of a citizen depends
largely on accuracy of vision, and the
relations between toe eyes and the brain
are the most mysterious phenomena of
human life. A man should see all there
is to see, but be does not often do so.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88065721/1885-07-11/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,mdu_galena_ver02,"","","",true,ca,Evening capital.,W.M.

Tbe“wild-cat” still Is usually quite a
primitive affair, consisting of a copper
still of small capacity, the necessary
worms and one or two barrels or ho£g.
heads in which is kept the mash. The
still is usually owned and operated by one
family, some male member of which is
always to be found at (he shed or cabinof
brush and logs in wbleh it is located. The
corn front which the whisky is made is
secured from the surrounding farmers or
raised by the owners, and the liquor sold
to anyone in the neighborhood who is
willing to pay r>oe. a gallon for it and
keep mum. By reason of this, enabling
them to eecure a fair quality of wnisky
cheap, the moonshiner makes friends of
all his neighbors, aud, as a rule, they are
ever ready to warn him of impending
danger, and at, tbe approach ot an officer
or even a suspicious-looking stranger all
evidences of the still are quickly re­
moved. This tact makes it an exceeding­
ly difficult task to apprehend the violators
of the law, and it is necessary to use the
utmost caution and discretion In order to
apprehend them at all. The chief source
ot revenue derived by West Tennessee
moonshiners comes from the whisky they
sell to storekeepers in small towns. In
dealing with whom they adopt such pro
cautions that while tbe store-keeper may
have an idea, he never know* precisely

These mowiHblne stills aro great resorts
for the men who dwell in the vicinity
where they are located, artd on Saturdays
and Sunday* and other idle days dozens
congregate around them and pass the
time dunk ing, smoking, and telling sto­
ries. Wh'le the West 'Tennessee moon­
shiner is Lilly as shiftless as bis brother
in the T ennessee mountains, about whom
so much has been written, he is not near
as bloodthirsty, probably because be ban
never been hunted so persistently, having
been allowed, in a manner, to pursue bis
business unmolested by meddlesome offi­
cials. Henoo, while many a revenue offi­
cer Ims dropped from hi* horse dead at the
crack of the mountaineer moonsbioer’s
rifle, there is but one or two Instances on
record where officers have been killod ln
West Tennessee.
Y( ars ago when revenue officers hunted
the festive moonshiner in bis lair, the
method ol entrapping them was to induce
sane one familiar with tbe country, gen­
erally a man who had a grudge against
the moonshiners or some negro who
would, for a consideration, agree to pilot
the * Ulcers to the still. Then a Deputy
Marshal went to th town nearest the
point he wished to reach, and summon­
ing a posse started out. In all of this it
was necessary to preserve the utmost se­
crecy.as the moonshiners invariably have
friends to w arn them. Piloted by tbe
guide the officers would approach until
they could see the smoke of the still curl­
ing above the tree tops, and then charged
down. Hometlmee they were successful
in capturing the men, but generally these
managed to escape. The officers always
cut up the worm, chopped up the stilt,
tore down tbo shanty and poured out the
mash and whisky that happened to be on
band.

For over eight years I have suffered

physicians without relief. 1 am now

will take a hot bath and lie in bed six­

Tho hen docs not caro for tho subllmola

Music hath no charms to soften her tough

that I am not worthy. IncvorfccI my ut­

presses a deslro to set 1 excuse myself nud

when n hen desires to bo nlono. That Is no
tlmo for me to Intrudo with my shallow
levity. Inoverdolt.
It Is after death that I most fully appre­
ciate tho hen. When sho has been cut down
early In llfo and fried I respect her. No ono
can look upon tho still features of n young
hen overtaken by death In llfo's young
morning, snuffed out, as It were, lllio an
old tin lantern In a iralo of wind, without
being visibly affected.
Hut It Is not tha hen who desires to set

edition of springchlckcns that I am avcrso
to. It Is the aged lieu, who Is In her dotage,
and whoso cirgs, nlso, nro lu their second

hook of tlmo, shallow lu her remarks, and

her collection of no value to any ono but tho

This bin docs not win tho general confi­

life, her death Is only regretted by thoso
who aro called upon to assist at hor obso­
qulcs. Selfish through llfo, her death Is re­
garded as a calamity by thoso nlono who
nro expected to cat her.
And what has such a hen to look hack
upon In her closing hours t A long llfo,
perhaps, for longevity Is ouo of tho
characteristics of this class of hens; but of
what has that llfo boen productive?
How many golden hours has sho frlttorod

cottages. How mrtuy nights has sho psssod
In solitude on her lonely nest with a heart
filled with bitterness toward all mankind,
hoping ou against hopo that In tho fall sho
would come oft tho nest with a cunning

Such Is tho history of tho nlmloss hen.

THE CHINESE QUESTION.
The harmony of our relations with China is
fully J. j
In the application of the acts lately passed to j
execute the treaty of 1SSO. restrictive of the |
immigration of Chinese laborers into the United |
States, individual cases of hardship have oc­
I curred beyond the power of the Executive to
remedy, and calling tor judicial determination.
The conditio^ ot the Chinese question in the
Western States and Territories Is, despite this
restrictive legislation, far irom being satisfac­
tory. The recent outbreak in Wvommg Terri­
tory, where numbers of unoffending Chinamen,
! indisputably within the protection of the trea­
ties and the law, were murdered by a mob, and
the still more recent threatened outbreak of
the same character in Washington Territory,
are fresh iu the minds ol all, and there is apprt
t ension lest the bitterness of feeling against
the Mongolian race on the Pacific slope may
find vent lu similar lawless demonstrations.
? Alt lh? power of this government should be ex­
cited to maintain the amplest ;ood faith toward
' China in the treatment ol these men, aud the
inflexible sternness of the law in bringing the
j wrong-doers to justice should be insisted upon.
Every ettort has l?een made by this Govern­
j ment to prevent these violent outbreaks and
to aid the representatives ot China in their
investigation of these outrages: aud it is but
jus', fosay that they are traceable to the law­
lessness ""ot men not citlz< ns of the United
! States engaged in competition with Chinese
laborers.
Kaoe prejudice Is the chief factor In originat­
ing these disturbances, and it exists in a large
part of our douialu. Jeopardizing our domestic
peace ar.J the good relationship we strive to
maintain with China.
The admitted right of a government to*pre-?
j vent the influx of elements lrwtilu to its iuter­
j nal peace and security may not be questioned,
even where there is no treaty stipnl-itlon on the
subject. That the exclusion of Chinese labor Is
dema.ded In oilier couutrW where like con­
ditions prevail is strongly evidenced in the
Oou.lnion of * panada, where Chinese iirmigra­
tion is now regulated by laws more exclusive
than our own. If existing laws ^re Inadequate
to compass the end in view, I shall he prepared
j to give earnest consideration to any further
! remedial measure*, within the treaty limits,
i which the wisdom of Congress may devise.
THE CONGO BASIN'.
I he Independent .-Lute ui the Congo has been
' organized us a government, under the sov­
? - ..?> His Majesty the King of the Belgians,
* u-j Mo&uiues u-? chief i.iagistrucy in his per­
sonal character onl>, without making the new
State a dependency of Belgium. It Is fortunate
, that a benighted region.owingall it has of quick­
ening civilization to the'beneficence aud phi­
lanthropic spirit of this monarch, should have
the advantage and security of his benevolent
stipe rvisiou.
The action taken by this Government last
year In being the brat to recognize the flag of
the International Association of the Congo nas
been followed by formal recognition ot the new
nu'tonality which succeeds to its sovereign
powers.
A conference of delegates of the principal
commercial nations was held at Berlin last
winter to discuss methods whereby the Congo
Basin might be kept open to the world's trade.
Delegates attended on behalf of the United
Stales on the understanding that their part
should be merely deliberative, without Impart­
ing to the results any binding character, so ter
as the United Slates were concerned. This re­
serve was due to the indisposition ol this Gov­
ernment to share In any disposal by an Inter­
national congress of Jurisdictional questions in
remote foreign territories. The results of the
conference were embodied in a formal act ol
the nature of an international convention,
which laid down certain obligations
purporting to be binding on the sig­
natories. sublect to ratification within one
year. Notwithstanding the reservation under
wbleh the delegates of tne United SUtss at­
' ?

tended, their signatures were attached to the
general act iu tlie same ma oner as those of the
plenipotentiaries of other governments, thus
making the United States appear, without re­
serve or qualification, km signatories to a Joint
international en^ajrement imposing on the
signers the conservation of the territorial in­
tegrity ol distant regions where we have no es­
tablished interests or control.
I his Government does not, however, regard
its reservation of liberty of action in the prem­
ises a? at all Impaired; and holding: that an en­
gagement to *hare In the obligation of enforc­
neutrality iu the remote valley of the L'on^o

Columbus, O., Feb. 18.?It is announced that
Prof. Weber, of the chair of agricultural chem­
istry, state university, has just made au im­
portant discovery in chemistry in connection
with ihe microscopic tests to distinguish oleo­
margarine from butter. Recently l?r. Thomas
Taylor, of the department of agriculture, an­
nounced at a meeting of microscoplsts that
butter placed under a microscope showed
round crystals marked by plain cross, which
could be lotmd uowhere else. When the |H>lar­
ers are used with the microscope these butter
crystals, which are in re ility only globules of
fat, show four parts each, two green and two
yellow. Tne chemical test to distinguish be­
tween butter and oleomargarine is very deli­
cate, the ouiy difference between the material
matters appreciable to chemists being that
butter contains a small amount of butyric acid
which is laeking in the oleomargarine. This
test is not always successful, and as the differ­
ence was likely to be washed out by enterpris­
ing oleomargarine manu.acturers, l?r. Taylor's
discovery was heralded fur and wide, and the
test was adopted where known. Prof. Weber
lias discovered that the mixing of a little water
and salt with the oleomargarine, a process it
always undergoes, causes the bogus butter to
develop under the microscope exactly such
""crystals"" as are found in the legitimate article,
and the same result can be obtained w ith pure
tallow treated in like manner. Tliis discovery
destroys iu a great measure the usefulness of
lir. Taylor's discovery and strengthens the po­
sition ol the oleomargarine manufacturers.

The beaten steel ita strength must prive;

Increase of the Anglo-Saxon.
The Latin races, that is, France, Italy,
and Spain, havo ceased to be, whatever
any of them may be destined yet to be­
come again, the mighty factors in the
world's progress which of old they were.
They minister exquisitely to the comfort,
the luxury, the culture and the pictur­
csqueness of life ; but the aptitude for
foreign commerce which they show is
comparatively slight, and in the coloniz­
ing business of humanity they only play
a subordinate part. Moreover, their pop.
ulation, when compared with the popula­
tion of the Anglo-Saxon and the Teutonic
races, is diminishing. Thus, in a period
of a little less than one hundred years,
from 1788 to 1885 the aggregate popula­
tions of France, Spain and Italy have
only increased from 51,000,000 to 82,­
500,000. On the other hand, the popn­
lations of Germany and England during
this period have each trebled. Germany
in 1788 had a population of almut 15,­
000,000; in 1885 it has increased to45,­
000,000. Great Britain in the same way
had in 1788 a population of 13,000,000,
in 1885 the figure is 86,000,000. Anoth­
er country largely, but not exclusively,
populated by the Anglo-Saxon race
America has in less than a hundred
years increased nearly thirteen times
that is, from lets than 4,000,000 in 1790
to nearly 60,000,000 in 1883. Finally it
'must not lie forgotten that Canada, Aus­
tralia, South America, as well as othf t
British' dependencies, collectively, con

tain a popuUtien of some 10,000,000,

Another General Pension Bill.
Washington, June S.?The House com­
mittee on invalid pensions to-day agreed to
report fls a substitute for Senator Blair's
pension bill, tho bill introduced by Mr.
Ellsberry, of Ohio, with amendments. The
Blair bill granted divisible pensions accord­
ing to disability ranging from $24 per month
down to $4, to invalid soldiers and sailors of
the United States in the civil war, who are
dependent upon their daily labor for sup­
port. The bill agreed upon by the House
committee provides for a uniform pension
of $12 per month for all soldiers and sailors
who are absolutely disabled and unable to
maintain themselves, and does not recog­
nize distinctions in rank.

If the feet are tender and painful after long
standing or walking, great relief may be ob­
tained by bathing them in warm salt and water.
A large handful of salt to a gallon of water as
warm as can be borne is the proper proportion.
The feet should be immersed and the water
thrown over them with the hand, and also over
the legs as far as the knees. When the water
becomes too cool, dry the feet and legs, rubbing
with a coarse towel, upward. Neuralgia of the
feet has been cured by perseverance in this

here last night and up to 5 oAlock
this morning. The first shock was
fearful and housos wero shaken as
though made of paste board. It
seemed as if everything must topple.
The rumbling in the earth was loud
and horrifying in the extreme.
Clocks stopped, hells were rung and
damage was done to some buildings,
principally by tho toppling of chim­
neys. Two rooms in the Governor's
mansion were wrecked. Thero were
a number of cases of prostration, and
doctors wero in demand for the

RICHMOND.

In its halls Jefferson, Madison and Monroe
have spoken, nnd nearly every noted Vir­
giuian has sat in them as a member of the
state legislature. During tho war it was the
omiitol building of the Confederate states,
Thy Confederate congress sat iu it and every
atom of its old masoury is filled with history.
Walking up its front steps you enter a sort
of a rotunda, in tho center of which there is a
statue of ""Washington by Iloudon, and this
statue is said to be the best ever made of him.
Lafayette culled it tho fue-sinuie of Wash­
ington's person, and it is the most lifelike
marble'representation I have ever seen. It is
just life size and Houdon prepared his sketch
for it at Mount Vernon. He took a cast of
Washington's face, plastering the lisad of the
Father of our Country over with paste and
then removing this carefully enough to get a
mold. Ho also took a cast of tho upper part
of Washington's body and minutely meas­
ured his person mid then went to l'aris to
make the statue, He took these casts at
Mount Vernon iu 1785, before Washington be­
come president, and the statue was erected
threo years before ho died. It was paid for
by the legislature of Virginia. Tho forehead
of this Washington is not so high us those of
Stuart's pictures. It is receding ruiUsr than
full, and the wholo man does not seem to bo
tho giant represented by other painters.

HOODON'S STATUE O* WASHINGTON,
In this rotunda of tho Richmond capitol
there is on old stove made of iron which is
said to bo ono of tho oldest stoves hi existence.
It was made a present to the colony of
Virginia in 1770 and was spoken of at that
timo as a warming machine. It is seven feet
high and has as much ornamentation as a
Queen Antie hojuse. What is how the. Vir­
ginia senate chamber was occupied during
tho war as the Corifodorste house of repre­
sentatives. Tho Confederate senate was on
the second floor, but its hall has now been cut
up in rooms for tho government. On the
floor below this is the hall of tho houso of
delegates, where Aaron Burr was tried before
Chief Justice Marshal! fw treason and whero
the state socession convention met in 1801.
Pictures of Chatham and Jefferson hang
upon tho walls and the delegates sit with a
little old fashioned school-like desk in front
of them. On tho opposite side of the rotunda
on tho second floor is the state library which
has 85,(XX) volumes and the walls of which
aro hung with curiosities. Here is Stonewall
Jackson's last dispatch to Lee, written just
before be died. It is on a half sheet, of com­
mon letter paper, tho edges of which are
ragged whore it was evidently torn off in a
hurry. Itis written with a pencil, nnd the
handwriting is aa small as that of a woman.
In it Jackson announces his trust in- i-""rovi­
denco in speaking of his situation and signs
it: ""Respectfully, T. J. Jackson.""

Judge A. It. Boteler, the pardon clerk of
tho attorney general's office, is.one of tho fine
old gentlemen about Washington who have
made a great deal
of history. He was

Many of them wero by ladies, and some were
made of satin and silk of various colors.
Some wore vory ridiculous, and out of all
symmetry or propriety. Many had the idea

were made up of tho moon, stars and all tho

John Randolph, of lioanoko, now reposes
in tho Holly wood cemetery nt Richmond. I
visited-his tomb tho other day. It is in tho
now part of the cemetery, far away from
those of Presidents Monroe end Tyler. It
consists of an immense slab of granite, five
feet wide and seven feet long. This slab is
about a foot thick, and it rests upon a base
flat upon the ground. A smooth granite wall
round at tho top and about eight inches high
surrounds the lot in •which the monument lies,
and on the slab is the inscription

tual experience in "" riding on trail"" to
imagine the difficulties involved in driv­
ing a large her! of wild cattle over moun­
tain ranges, across desert lands where in
some cases food and water are n--t found
for many miles, and where streams must
! crosse.1 which are liable to dangerous
freshets.
A large part of the northern ranges is
embraced in the area which Silas Bent,
an accomplished meteor.!. -gist, terms
""the birth pla-e the tornado."" Thunder
and lightning are here frequent, and they
are especially terrifying to rings cattle.
The most thrilling incident in the life of
the cow-boy occurs on the oit anion of a
thunder-storm at night. Such an occur­
rence is thus described from persona! ob­
servation by Mr. William A. Bailiie
Grohiuan an English writer:
- ""On the approach of one of these vio­
lent ont bursts the whole force is ordered
on duty ; the spare horses of which
each man has always three, and often as
many as eight or ten are carefully fed
am! tether.-.!, and the beard is 'round
up.' that is, collected into as small a spa
as possible, while the men continue to
ride around the densely masse. I herd.
Like horses, cattle derive courage froiu
the close proximity of man. The thun­
der peals, am! the vivid lightning dashes
with amazing brilliancy, as with lowered
heads the herd eagerly watch the slow,
steady pwe of the cow-ponies, and no
doubt derive fmiu it a comforting sense
of protection. Sometimes, however, a
wild steer will be unable to control his
terror, and will make a dash through a
convenient opening. The crisis is at hand
for the example w ill surely be followed,
and in two minutes the whole hen! of
41 Ml head will have briken through the
line of horsemen and be away, one surg­
ing larUowing mass of terrified beasts.
Fancy a pitcbdaxk night, a pouring tor­
rent of rain, the ground not only entirely
strange to the men, but very broken, and
lull of dangerously steep Watrrsi-oursen
and hoilows, and you will have a picture
of cow-boy duty on such a night. They
must head off the leaders. ( uce fairly
off, they wiil stampede twenty, thirty
and even forty miles at a stretch, and
many branches will stray from tiie uiaia

Napoleon i otild not cone al his adrnira­

this beautiful country! How much it
resembles Porto Kerrujn, in Elba.’’

But of all the incidents wh ch oc­
curred while Napoleon wa< in Tor bov,
tlio most remarkable was a farewell
visit pa d him by a ladv of fore gn ap­
pearauce and surpassing loveliness,
t 1 naked anil vailed, to csch|h* oitserva­
t on. she carried with her a bouquet of
choicest Ho went, peeul arlv arruntrod in

conveu ent distance from the Bellero­

servant. As the token of unchang""d
ulh*el on reaclicil the quarter-dock, the
lad v was ohs< rved to ra se her vail, dis­
clos tig feiturea of exceeding bcautv.
At first, tlie 1h»u n -t seemeu to nwakeu
no memories n Napoleon’s breast, but
alter a nt incut, lie hast’ly approached
the ship's side, and .steadfastly gaz.ing
awhile on the fair form d scloscd to
view, he waved a last farewell.
On Wednesday the 2d of August, the
Bellerophon and Tonnant sailed for
1 lyuiouth, where it had lieen intended
that the transfer to the Northumberland
should be carried out. But in conse­
quence of the loss of life which occurred
from the vast concourse of boats in the
Sound, as well as to avo da writ ofhalieus
corpus, under which t was desired to
ob tain th‘ evidence of Napoleon in a
ease at flu* time pending in the Queen's
Bi nch. it was deemed advisable to return
to Tor hav, where on Sunday the 6th of
August, the three vessels (the Northum­
berland having meantime come round
from Portsmouth) cast anchor. No
sooner were the sh ps brought tin. than

Nir ilenry linn bury, necompnnietl by
Mr. Hath irst, proceeded on board the
Hcllerophon, and announced to the cx­
Empc>or the resolution of the Cabinet,
th it ho should lie transported to St.
Helena, acconipau'ed by four of h s
fr ends and twelve servants. The infor­
med on was received without surprise;
but in a speech of three-qua tors of an
hour s duration, delivered in a manner
the mo-^t impress ve, Napoleon protest­
ed aga nst t o determination which had
been arriv d at.
The same afternoon, Lord Ko'th and
Sir George Coekburu proceeded in the
! Admiral s yacht to the Hcllerophon.
1 Napoli on was on deck to receive them,
i After the usual salutations. I.ord Keith
addressed hires -If to Bonaparte, and ac­
I quainted him with his intended transfer
to the Norttiumbcrlun I for passage to
St. II lena. After much expostulat on.
Nap tie >n tinallv refused to go; but uj>­
ou I.ord Keitii expressing the hope that
no coarc on would he necessary to carry
out the orders of Governm nt., he re­
plied “(>, no, no! you command, I
must obey! Only, recollect, 1 do not g »
of Iiiv own free "" ill.” lie then formally
handed to land Keitii a written protest
agaii st n s transportat on to St. Helena,
in which ;t was contended that, having
come voluntarily on board the Beliero­
phon, he was the guest and not the pri—
oner of England. “I appeal,’' he onn­
eluded, “to history, whether an enemy
who comes delm irately in his m -for­
tunes to seek an a-ylum under the pro­
tection of En ;lis!i law, ran give a more
convincing proof of his esteem and con­
fidence. Hut how have llie Engl sh an­
swered such eon fidi nee and magnan in­
dy ? l'hev pretendo I to extend a fr end­
lv hand to th s eiicun : and when lie re­
lied on their good faith, they sacrificed
him. ”
It was afterward arranged that the
transfer should take phe e the following
morning (Monday) about eleven
o'clock. Early next day. Sir George
( oekburn superintended the inspection
• f the baggage, consisting of serv ces
and toilet se. - of plate, several articles
in gold books, ball, etc., which wero
sent on board the Northuinlwrland four
thousand gold napoleons Itcug Healed
tip and d tained. The baggage having
been removed the parting scene com­
nienc ■(!, Nnpoleon haml ng to several
of his oilierrs a certificate of fidelity and
good service. About eleven o clock the
I arge of the Tennant procce led to the
Hcllerophon to receive the fallen Em­
peror a d those who were t » bo the par­
takers of h exile: General and Madame

Indian Ornaments.
There are but few ornaments now in 4 . 1^use
with any meaning, says a correspondent
of the Helena (Montana) Herald, ; >
writing of the Dakota Indians. Eagle * ^
feathers, the number worn showing the
number of enemies killed, the wing
feathers of the bald-headed eagle denoting
male, and the black eagle feathers denoting
women, are, perhaps, most prominent. *
If they have scalped the enemy a broad
red streak is painted upon the feathers.
If the person killed was of prominence or
reputation, the feather is sometimes dyed
red. Small sticks wrapped with porcupine
quills are sometimes attached to the
quill of the feather, and little pieces of
white fur glued to the ends. No one will
wear an eagle feather unless entitled to
it ?<? fhev helinvft it will flv awav from

their heads if worn unlawfully. The
scalp-Lock is still worn even among the
so-called civilized Indians. They arrange
the scalp-lock proper an inch across, and
tie around this very firmly a head-band,
and then the hair is braided and an otter
skin is tied around it spirally, forming a
braid at least two-and sometimes as much
as four feet long. This is kept oiled for
the enemy. If an Indian has the time,
and the person killed is of importance,
he will scalp off the whole from beneath
the eyebrows, including the eyes. Grizzly
claws are worn as necklaces?I do not believe
as a mark of distinction, but as they
are costly I think the wearing of them is
merely a matter of wealth and not of
chieftainship. .
Aside from his religious position the
""Wi-cas-ta-wa-kan, or medicine man, is
the physician among the Dakotas, thoroughly
conversant with the medicinal
qualities of the various herbs. To give
greater effect to hi-> remedies he is accompanied
by drum aud rattles and indulges
in much contortion of features and limbs.
Often he sucks with his mouth over the
seat of pain?a novel way of cupping,
but often efficacious. I have seen cases
of lone- standinir cured bv these men. and

instances v.-here the army surgeon has
given them up. One cure I have in mind
was of cataract of the eye. It was cured
by inserting beneath the lids filings from
brass wire. The patients are always
painted red, to make their hearts strong,
they say. Often the medicine men will
cut an image out of paper or bark, and,
placing it upon the ground, the patient i3
held over it, then the medicine man will
take his gun and shoot the image, destroying
the evil spirit that has caused the
sickness.

Philadelphia Record.
The allusion in this month's installment of
Hay & Nicnlay's ""Life of Lincoln"" to the nick­
name ""Woolly Horse."" applied to General Fre­
mont in the campaign of 18ZG, recalled to my
mind a story told me by an old Washingtonian
about the origin of the strange soubriquet. It
seems tbat after Fremont had first announced to
the world his discoveries in the great West a
Philadelphia showman of a tricky and specula­
tive turn undertook to 'exploit Lieutenant Fre­
mont's discoveries, and at the same time make a
little money for himself. So he came down to
Washington. Congress being then in session,
and. hiring a shop on the avenue, proceeded
to advertise and exhibit ""Lieutenant Freemont's
woolly horse, captured by the gallant explorer
in the very heart of the Rocky mountains, at the
risk of his life,"" Of course, it was only an ordi­
nary, everyday horse, with patches of wool stuck
on. But it took, and the showman began to
make money on it. One fine day Senator Ben­
ton. Fremont's father-in-law, beard of the
humbug, and started out, vowing to drive
it out of town before evening. Taking
a brother Senator with him, he marched
at once on tne enemy's shop. The showman,
who was standing outside the door, and who
knew him perfectly well, had the impudence to
go right on with his lecture. He even went so
far as to say to the crowd, ""Here is Lieutenant
Fremont's father-in-law Senator Benton. Won't
you walk in. Senator, and take your friend
with yon? It won't cost yon a cent."" ""Come in­
side."" said Benton, sternly, handing blm $1 and
striding in with his friend; ""where is this' ani­
mal?"" Here he is,"" said the showman, begin­
ing at the beginning of his lecture again.
""Stop!"" said Benton, in the tone that had often
made the Senate chamber, ring; ""if you don't'
tako that fraud out of this town before dark I'll
make you wish you had never been born."" The
impudence ot the man was frightened out of him
by Benton's severity and earnestness. ""I'll go,""
he said, and went that evening. But it was only
to exhibit the ""woolly horse"" elsewhere, and to

Fi'Om a London Letter.
In everything except the indispensable tawny
beard that falls like a roll of dead gold silk to
the extremity of a massive chest. Prince Albert
Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales,
models himself on Ouida's heroes. He is as fond
of knickknacks as a lady. Hit; private apart
meats arc the nearest approach to the talented
but vulgar authoress’ ideal of a young Guards­
man's rooms. He would not brush his hair
otherwise than with an ivoiy-backed brush to
save his life. Eau dc* Cologne and other per­
fumers have their place in bis bath. To write a
note on paper that was not the triumph of the
perfumer's art, would, in his own imagination,
he unworthy of his tastes and position.
He has started in life, in fact, as
n;i exquisite of the George IV. typ*:
but limkily for himself and for * the
nation, he is preserved from some of the most
objectionable traits of the “First Gentleman's”
character by the sensitive shyness of his dis­
position. He differs again from most exquisites
m haring a praise worthy desire to pay promptly
for the luxuries in which he indulges. Indeed,
he worries his attendants to worry his trades­
people to send in their bills sharp, and frets and
fumes if the astute shopkeeper—alive to the
value of having the future King of England
upon their books within decent limits--demy in
delivering their accounts. Like his father, he
gets his clothes -and plenty of them-from
Poole. Prince Albert Victor's idea of dignified
muft is a frock coat and la vendor or gray t rous­
ers. He seldom wears a cutaway coat, and
even when traveling hardly ever uppoars in a
suit of dittoes. On the whole, he may be de­
scribed us a very stately and solemn young man.

catcher than all three of threats. Monday

the snake had raptured a rat and was try­

alive and strenuously protested against go­

hold of tho floor or other surroundings.
Tho snake was wiser than the rat however,
and would raise him up a foot or two in the
air, and in that position continue the swul
lowing process, dropping down again to tho
floor to rest occasionally. Mr. Jackson says
it, was a circus and he would not part with
tho snake for a considerable consideration.

Household Hints.
For peach fritters make a batter of two well­
beaten eggs, half a pint of milk and a little salt;
beat very smooth and light, and then pour in
tho remainder of the milk and eggs, to which is
added a tablespoonful of butter or olive oil.
Peel and cut the peaches in halves; dip them in
the batter and fry then in boiline fat until they
are a delicate brown. Serve on a hot dish and
sprinkle with powdered sugar.
For apple marmalade take nice sound 'apples,
pare and core, cut in small pieces, and to every
pound of fruit add one pound of sugar; put the
sugar to boil, with just enough water to dis­
solve it, into-a preserving kettle, add one large
lemon to every four pounds of fruit, boil all
together until the sirup gets thick, then add the
apple tkui boil until it looks clear. This is well
made with half quince and half apple.

Not many miles from Berlin there
lives a man who, if what report savs of
him be true, is certainly one of the most
remarkable phenomena on record. The
papers state as a positive fact that he
has no Wood in his veins, and that a
committee of the leading physicians and
scientists have declared their inability
to account for this extraordinary cir­
cumstance. The man is a corporal in
t he German army and goes by the name
of Otto Schreiber. He himself was
quite unconscious of his bloodless con­
dition until two months ago, when he
fought a duel with a fellow soldier.
His opponent ran his sword through
his body, without, however, drawing
any blood, and the “patient” seemed
not a bit tho worse. The man was so
taken by surprise that Otto had no
trouble in killing him. Since that time
the comrades of the corporal have been
careful not to tread on his toes, and on
no consideration to accept a challenge
from him. lie was submitted to a se­
vere test at a medical institute in Ber­
lin. A knife was thrust into his mouth,
tiie point comingVut at the back of the
neck. Not a drop of blood was spilled,
ami Otto fult,no pain during the opera­
tion. The gentlemen who examined
him are now fully convinced that there
are many things iu heaven and earth
that they never dreamed of. Otto
Sehreibcr intends, ns soon as his time is
up (tho next year), to show himself in
tlie principal cities of Europe.—La Es­

Aii Electrical Car.
One of the remarkable s gilts in this
city, says a New York letter I » tlie* Cin­
cinnati Coinillrfi'iif/ (ituHr, is tile .llllicil
electricll car rushing along in a way that,
excite a degree of surpris • approaching
alarm. The ear is the ordinary style
familiar on the streets, painted green,
with a I ell that rings sharply, and a lii^
lamp in front. The prop -lling power is
invisible. It consUtRof cl ctrieity stored
in tanks fitted under sods. The ear
spins along at a lively rate, if peiuuit'.c 1.
and is under peifect control. It is
stopped in less time than horses can he
checked, and starts with a go die facility,
and gains speed as if motion was its
natural condit on nnd the lots were en­
forced. The one that I saw on fourth
avenue was gliding ahead, pursued and
in part surrounded by a great swarm of
hoys, who seemed to Ire of the impression
that they were witnessing a show of
magic. The street car horses did not
like the monster, ami pranced as if they
proposed going on a strike. The elec­
trical ear bail a load of passengers, and
moved over ordinary tracks in a master­
ful manner. Of course, if this sort of
ihing can he carried on at a i heap rate,
tlicic will not long he use for horses or
cables. There is a dillieulty, I am told,
in the cost of the plant, nnd the <| tics -
tion that raises the uncertainty is as to
the endurance of the co-tly pbi-ib It
should he noted that the ears I (b scribe
are not run upon specially n opared
tracks, nnd are not connected with wires
that are. streaks of lightning from dyna­
mos. The running machinery is. of
course, peculiar, nnd the clc ti icily is
stored. Electricians my tint great ad­
vances have been made within a few
months in the storage of electricity, and
if it progresses a little further tlm ap­
plication of it will be something infinite.

The Art of Sermon Milking.
For o number of years, says the Rev.
A. .1, F. lh-hrcnd in the Rrooklyn /:'nrjU\
“ I continued to read half of my sermons
and to prepare the other half without
u-c of the pen. Rut my written ami
speaking styles were out of Inrmony. I
found myself living a double mental life.
My prm< liing lacked uniformity and the
individuality which grows out of Fie
use of a single method. Ho I abandoned
both methods and adopted tin- third
that of preparing a careful brief mas­
tering its contents without special at­
tention to the language and then freely
reproducing it. In speech and without
tin- use of a note. Th u has been my
habit for over fifteen \enrs, and I am
sure that for me it is the best The
written preparation ordinarily amounts
to 2,OU0 words, one-third of a fully w rit­
ten discourse. The 1 bought is put as
compactly as possible, and with special
regard to clearness and precision. No
elaboration, either of argument or of
imagery, is attempted at the time of
composition; this is left to the sulwe­
rjiicnt review, to which an hour nnd a
half is given Immediately lire ailing the
service, and very much Is left to the
friction of thought which »r* active and
attentive audience alw-ays excites.
Illowing tile Mayor’s Horn,
Among some of the numerous corpora
tien customs in Kngland, *avs OtimtU't
M'lf.atirn, may be mentioned the h'owing
of the "" Rurghmote Horn,’’ by the sound
of which the members of the corporation
were, in day* gone by, summoned to­
gether, This c i«toin probably dates
back to Anglo Saxon times, hnving been
in some places cent nued until our own
times. At l’i|Kin nn ancient horn is pre
served, which is sounded every day. ""if
a visitor should remain in the city,“writes
Mr, Walbra n, “during the evening he
irsy h ar the sounding of the Mayor’s
horn. It formerly announced the setting
of the watch, whence the chief officer of
the town derived the Saxon style of
‘wskeman,’ hut it is now, of course,
lapsed into a formality. Three hla«ts,
long, dull and dire, are given at nine
o'clock at the Mayor's door by his official
horn-blower, nnd one afterward at the
market cro*s, while the aeventh 1m>!| of
the cathedral is ringing. It was ordained
in that it should he h'own at the
four rorneis of the cross at nine o’clock,
f.ftcr which if Bny house 'on the gate
syd within the towns' was robbe I, ""the
wakeman was Imtind to compensate the
loss if it was j roved that he and his ser­
vants did not their dutie at the tune.”’

done without them. When work in done,
wash the hands in tepid water, pressing
the skin back at the base of the nail with

A ton sit iu gorgeous state,
And view my gathered treasures rare,
Which seem to mock my cruel fate
My lonely lot, so bleak and bare.
Wnnin Is wealth and warmth and light,
Close curtained from the whistling wind
That sweepi and swirls with reckless might.
Whose breath brings death to human kind.
Ent the cold wind of her deep scorn
Has blighted all my joy of life;
Within my soul no houe ia born­
No rest or peace, but savage strife,
And what care I for pride or fame.
Since love from out my life is driven?
All. all is but an empty name­
Ashes the prize lor which I've striven.
Pead ashes from a deep despair,
A heart burned out by passion's fire
0 üod ! she was so false, so fair,
And blind was I with fond desire.
1 loved with love that ne'er grows old;
My worship followed where she led;
I'nt weary of a tale oft-told,
She left me! and the world Is dead.

Local Option Unconstitutional in Michi­
gan.Laxsixg, Mich., May 18. The supreme
court has unanimously declared the local
option law unconstitutional. The ground
on which, this dealsion was reached is very
simple. The law Is a direct violation of
article 4, section 20, of the constitution.
Although other points are touched upon in­
cidentally, the article of the constitution
violated provides that no law shall emorace
more than one object which shall be em­
bodied In its title. The local option law is
entitled ""An act to regulate the manufac­
ture and sale of liquors,"" which is not at
all what the law is for.

It would be an absurd and a dishonoroble af­
fectation if we were to pretend to look upon
the issue thus framed with indifference. We
believe that it has vital relations to the future
of our country. We believe that the coming
election will be likely to settle the trend of
national life for some years to come. Nor have
we any wish to conceal our personal predic­
tions and predjudices. They are in favor of
economical expenditures and a lowered tariff.

■—Paper is made out of the cedar
chips of pencil manufacturers, which is
useful for preserving carpets and other
woolen goods and furs from tho attacks
of moths.
—lt has been demonstrated in France
that electricity can be effectively used
“for aging whisky and maturing wine.”
It seems that all that is necessary is to
pass a strong electric current through
the whisky to be aged or the wine to
be matured, and the work is done.
—Dr. Donald G. Hood has collected
,many facts relating to the use of salicy­
lic acid for rheumatism. Of 728 patients
treated with salicylates, 523 were re­
lieved of their pains within seven days;
whereas, of 612 patients treated by
other methods, only 140 were relieved
within the same time.
—-Some people doubt the poisonous
effect of nutmeg, but several cases of
nutmeg-poisoning have been noted in
the British Medical Journal. A whole
nutmeg was taken in four of the cases,
and five whole ones in the remaining
case. In still another case the use of
half a nutmeg in a hot drink was nearly
fatal.
—Sulphuric ether gontly applied
with cotton wool, away from tho light,
is effective for removing printer’s ink
from paper, 4t sufficient pains Ijg taken.
Put blotting paper beneath the one
from which the ink is to be removed,
and use clean, white blotting paper to
absorb the color after each application
of tho ether.—Stationer and Printer.
—According to a Spanish journal,
if blood be mixed with a little bile,
small crystals are formed which are of
different shapes in different species of
animals. In man they are right angled
prisms, in the horse cubes, in pigs
rhomboids, in sheep rhomboidal plates,
in dogs right angled prisms very simi­
lar to those seen in human blood, and
in chickens more or less regular cubes.
—Experiments have proved that tho
tensile strength of a wot ropo is only
one-third that of the same rope when
dry; and a rope saturated with grease
or soap is weaker still, as tho lubricant
permits the fibres to slip with greater
facility. Hemp rope contracts strongly
on being wet, and a dry rope twenty­
five feet long will shorten to twenty­
four on being wet.
—A substitute for juto in the manu­
facture of cotton bagging seems to have
been found in pine straw, which is
made into bagging by a firm in Wil­

—M. Mourlot, of Paris, obtains from
tlie essence of birch bark, by rectifica­
tion, an essential oil which possesses,
among other properties, that of being
fatal to insect life and an electrically
insulating tarry substance. These two
products are so treated and combined
with other substances as to produce an
anti-oxidizing material and an insulat­
ing substance capable of tho same ap­
plications as ebonite. Among the other
ingredients employed, in addition to
the products from the essence of birch
bark, are caoutchoue, sulphur, chalk,
talc, litharge, antimony sulphide, kao­
lin, zinc white and red ochre. It is, of
course, well known that an infusion of
the leaves of the common white birch
produces a yellow dye of established
value in certain applications.

GOVERNMENT CLERKS.
Some of the Causes That Lead Many ot
Them Into Had Habits.
The clerks have a lazy life at Wash­
ington compared with persons who
perform clerical services in commercial
cities. They do not go to work until
nine o'clock in the morning and are
off duty for the day at four o'clock p.
m. They are paid more money than
the average one could possibly oaru in
any other calling, and provisions and
house rent are almost as cheap as in
St. Louis or any largo city. Young
men who dosire to become lawyers or
doctors have a splendid chance here to
attend fine colleges and make a good
living while they aro acquiring an
education, if they can get into tho
departments. A large percentage of
those who come here with such
objects in view become inert, how­
ever, fall into bad habits, and are
finally kicked out of the office, and then
they go to tho bad at a headlong pace.
They have too much loafing time, and
become demoralized. So-called fash­
ionable society takes the ambition out
of many. They get into a whirl—it is
quite easy to do so- -many of tho bet­
ter-looking ones vainly imagine they
can marry the ostensibly rich daugh­
ters of solid old Congressmen, Govern­
ment officials or retired merchants or
professional men who bring their fam­
ilies to Washington. The dear g#rls,
as a rule, are as sensible as they are
attractive, and tho mercenary fortuno
hunter around tho National capital is
not a howling success. The papas and
mammas have a deal of good sense,
1 and their daughters usually humor tho
National capital dudes only for a sea­
-1 sou, and then drop them and wind up
by marrying men who have proven
| themselves capable of battling with
tho world.—N. Y. Graphic.
The Old Man’s Mistake.
Mrs. Hondricks was entertaining
some ladies at a select little fivo o’clock
tea, and Hobby, who had been excep­
tionally well behaved, was in high
feather.
“Ma,"" ho said, politely, as refresh­
ments woro being served, “may i have
some tongue, please?” !•
“There isn’t any tongue, Hobby.”

Made to One.
Did you ever ""notice how women
hug themselves in cloaks and shawlsf
I first realized that feminine peculiar­
ity last evening at a fashionable con­
cert. The lobby was crowded by tho
arriving ladies ond gentlemen, the
former mostly in new opera wraps. I
noticed that nearly all were hugging
themselves unconsciously but fondly.
I found that I was doing it myself.
Tho wraps wcro generally drawn for­
ward until they were tenso and com­
forting around tho waist and shoul­
ders, and then the hands of tho wearers
were caressingly held on their own
opposite forearms, or were in some
way instinctively fojjdlin'g the owner.
All through tho performance I inves­
tigated my new discovery. On every
side were ocular evidences of woman s
born desire to be lovingly petted.- They
wore holding their own arms, squeez­
ing themselves with their own elbows,
pressing their hearts with their own
soft biceps, and in all these uncon­
scious indulgences they were demon­
strating that woman was made to hug.
-Clara Belle.
Quite at Cbanga,
Twenty -five years ago tho now Prin­
cess of Wales and future queen of Eng­
land was living on the third floor of a
corner houso in Copenhagen, and her
father, who no one ever dreamed then
of being a king, was poorer than many
a burger in the samo street She ana
her two sisters, now the czarina of
Russia and Duchess of Cumberland,
occupied the same room, scantily fur­
nished, and instead of a wardrobe a
curtain drawn across tho wall hid the
pegs on which their few dresses hung.
They had never worn a silk dress in
their lives. Now Alexandra doubtless
has all tho dresses sho wants, but it is
more than likely that she looks back
with pleasure upon those years as the
happiest of her life.
How Creeao Flay.
I do not know of anything that
lys so regular a game as geese,
ere is no wiser creaturo than a
goose. See a flock in tho water play­
ing at dive and catch. One goose goes
a little in front of tho rest and dives.
He is gone quite a whilo, during which
time the rest are watching with every
nerve ready. Up ho comes, after
swimming quite a distance under
water. YVhatA yell from every throat
as they go for hinil It is a sifjht for
a Harvard crew to watch. The best
oarsmen are now in front, and ho will
soon be overhauled. Down ho goes;
then the flock draws together, and tho
game begins over again. E. P. P. in

presented with tho crucifix:

NOW roB IT, BCTCUEBS!
In front of tho guillotiuo a board stood up­
right, to a height of flvo feet. In tbo top of it
waB a lunette. As Prado noared this board a
most dreadful serios of incidents followed
each othor with tho rapidity of light­
ning, lho trembling Abbd (for this is
his first execution here) stepped apart.
Four burly men, dressed in blouses ofblue-and-whito
striped ticking, who had not been seen
before, sprang forward, scizod tho con­
demned man, hnrled him onward against
the upright board, flung themselves
upon him. and by their weight, boro
tho stiuggling victim, face downward, to thb
top of tho low platform. That board worked
on a swivel and ran on rollers. In an instant it
had been wheeled forward until tho neck was
under tlio glistening knife, upon which tho
morning light had bogun to gleam. M. Dclbler,
who had stood like a man of Sinno at the
right of tho cuillorino during all this
tcrriblo scene, now reached forward and fixed
a wooden collai over tho back of the prison­
er's neck. Then wo all heard a sharp click
as tho knlfo was sprung and after an agon­
izing interval tho keen steel strnck tho neck as
it might havo collided with a rubber car-spring.
There was no hesitation in that knife. It went
through and the head of Prado lay among the
shavings beyond. The surgeon placed his
hand on tho trunk and said ; ""It est mart I"" An
Unnecessary act. The body was then rolled

l'rudo's Career or Crime.
Ou tho nightofjJan. 14, 1880, Mario Aquet­
tant, a noted cocotte, was found murdered in
hor apartments. Tho discovery was made
by her recognized lover, M. Dies.
Mario's maid said an unknown man had
accompanied her mistress home, A leather bag
containing Marie's jewels had been opened and
tho valuables stolen. No traco could be found
of tho woman's mysterious visitor, nor anything
discovered which would lead to his identity.
Boveral weeks later a man who gave the namo
of Prado was seen attempting to escape from a
private house will) a casket of jewels. Although
shot in the jaw, tho policeman managed to hold
his prisoner.
About tho same time Engone Fores tier, a deml­
mondainc, and Mauricette Comouneau. a mar­
ried woman, w ere arrested on a chargo of receiv­
ing stolen goods. , . .
Then it was shown that Eugenie was Prado's
mistress. Hho was finally induced to tell what
she know of tbo man. Ho was born in Mexico,
and thoro was some terrible secret about his
birth. Ho became a wanderer over the earth,
and in timo made his way to Mozambique, to
China, to Haytl and to New York. Many strange
storios. impossible of verification, ho told about
himself.
An English woman of noblo birth, a Sister of a
religious order, nursed him when ho was a
wounded soldier in a Spanish hospital. Thov
lied to Jerusalem, where sho gave up her yows
and married the adventurer. Tibo dfedinltaly
soon afterwards, and he returned to his life of
adventure. . .' . ,

himself Count Llnska do Castillon. The woman
was rpoerely attached to him. and spent upon
him tlin money sho received from other and
richer lovers. . ,
On the morning of Jan. in, 1880, Prado camo
to her in a state of great excitement. Hho saw
him burp his shirt and boots, lie told her ho
had killed Mario Aguettant. Ho was often cruel,
and by no means faithful but Eugenie kept his se­
cret. One day.notloUg after the murderofMailc,
Eugenio was summoned to loin Prado in llor­
dcaux. They bal not been there long together
before she dlscpvercd that he was living, with

kept his secret. ... ... , , ,

Jane Gregory, in December Wide Awake.
Shakespeare makes Hamlet say:
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral
baked meats
Did coldly f urnish forth the marriage table.
But a good New England woman did a
""thriftier"" thing than that. Her mother
had a long sickness and finally died, of in­
rlamniatory rheumatism, leaving several
half-used bottles of medicine which be­
came a source of great concern to the
daughter, for it ought not to be wasted,""
sho said. She offered to sell it at a dis­
count to a neighbor, but finding it left on
her hands she took it all herself for sore
throat, colds, gastric trouble, and whatev­
er ailment sho nappened to have.
Tho same woman once told two visitors
whom she had invited to tea that she had
been in a good deal of trouble that day to
calculate upon just how many biscuits to
make for the meal. She always knew
about her own family; she ""allowed one
apiece, and an extra ono in case of being
extra hungry;"" but where two new persons
wero concerned whose appetites and habits
wero an unknown quantity she was in such
a state of mind that she was ""fairly upsot,""
and at the table 6he watched with keen
eyes to see what was to be the fate of the
one ""extra"" biscuit, which was all she could
bring herself to provide beyond tho regular
""extra"" of tho family.
A certain New England family will never
forget their inward amusement at the re­
mark of a ""near"" woman las penuriousness
and close calculation are phrased), who had
come to see them in the beginning of her
annual round of visiting to ""save her
board;"" sho remarked at the dinner-table
that the food ""tasted good,"" for6ho had
been keeping herself ""short,"" in expecta­
tion of shutting up her honse.
She had been brought up in such a small,
narrow way that she ""could tell to a pin""
every article she had with her. Wiien a
little girl sho had been sent from homo to
school, and boarded with her aunt Esther,
having for room-mate a girl named Han­
nah. At tho closo of tho ten-weeks term,
when getting her things together, fcho went
to her relative, with these words;
""Aunt Esther, I wouldn't do such a thing
as to say that Hannah would steal, but
when I camo here I had seven needles and
four rows of pins. Now, Aunt Esther, five
pins are gone, and there is ono of the
needles which I can't find. Hannah must
havo taken them!''
Once when she was going away for two
or threo days, 6he ollercd a neighbor the
morning's tea-grounds to steep over, and,
to save it, a pumpkin pie which sho was
afraid wouldn't keep till she got home..
But she returned sooner than she expected,

SPECIALTY FARMING.
Why It Dnrl Not P«y an Well »« So-Celled
tienernl Purpoie Agriculture.
In some places farmers run to corn;
in others, brdotrt-eorrt; and again in
others, to flax, etc., but, it you have
observed closely, you will not fail to
notice that where one made a success
of this specialty farming, there were
ten who failed. A farmer; to be one
in every sense of the word, should be
able to plant a reasonable acreage of
the various crops, as they can bo plant­
ed In their season without interfering
with the cultivation or the planting of
other crops. His time should be so
divided with his various plantings that
no overtaxing of his working abilities
will occur at any one season of the
year, and idleness result at another.
The successful farmer has no spare
time for loafing at the cornor grocery,
but can employ himself with the va­
rious odds and ends of the great end­
less Variety of planttng, tilling, gather­
ing and storing of farm products;
I he repairing of fences and ma­

Ginnery* ur vuo many utuci
Chores that are always certain to
arise. But the farm hand, and often
the farmer himself, will complain that
this gives no rest from the labors of
the year. This is mainly true, but his
labors are so various, his duties so
widely diversified over the months of
the year, that in change of labor there
is rest; and he is his own judge the
greater, part of the time of the amount
of work he is compeled to perform in
a day or a week, and can govern him­
self accordingly. But in what other
vocation of life, carried on success­
fully, can this be said? When do their
resting spells come in? Only at a
sacrifice of time and salary, or busi­
ness. The businoss men of the city
get no relief from their monotonous
toil—the same round of duties day
after day; this they are compeled to
do or business failure results. The
general purpose farmer is the success­
ful one, especially where small capital
is invested; and to be able to farm all
crops combined with stock of various
kinds, will bring in money at all sea­
sons of the.year, and produce happier
and better results than any other vo­
cation that is to be found in this life,
less worry, more contentment, and bet­
ter results in the end. — Cor. Farmer$'
Call.
The Feeding of Animals.
In the feeding of animals it should
not be forgotten that the manure is to
be valued as the feeding is poor or
rich. Poor food makes poor manure,
rich food makes rich manure. Manure
from straw-fed animals is next to worth­
less; that from animals fed upon clover
hay, cotton-seed meal,bran, peas, wheat
middlings and linseed meal is rich and
contains as much fertilizing matter as,
if purchased from the dealer, would
cost very nearlg as much as the
feed itself. This is a bugbear
ana a paradox to many farmers,
but it is as true as that 1 taken
from 5 leaves 4, and these figures apt­
ly represent this absolute fact For if
the above rioh feeds are valued at $6
in money, the cows or horses or pigs
or beeves take the value of $1 out of
them, leaving $4 for the farmer in the
manure. And it is equally true that
the $5 worth of these foods, if judici­
ously used, will bring to the fanner
fully $5 or $6 or more in the growth of
the unimal. Was not then, the wise
Cicero quite right when he said the
feeding of animals is the most import­
ant fart of huabauiry?~M Y. Time*.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86074058/1889-01-17/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,msar_agate_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Brookhaven leader.,B.T.

Why should intelligent persons, as if
they were parrots, adopt and utter certain
phrases and exclamations? I sat by Mrs
Blank (her hu-baml is a clergyman) iu the
street-car a few days ago, and after we had
txch.tut.eJ greetings, I said, ‘‘My Cousin
Ageline Hails from Liverpool to-day.” ‘‘Is
that so'” said Mr-. Blank. “Yea,” 1
-■'id, rallying as well as I could, for this
reply takes all the spirt', from me, ‘‘aud
•he is always very ill on the ocean."" “Is
that no'."" sai l Mr-. Blank agu‘n. A pause
followed. How can one continue to jay
out the coin of conversation if not even
the interest eotnee back?
I was giad to get out of the car and
meet pretty Amy D-xter. I had a bit of
news for her. Amy is in the High School,
aud 1 told her at once that Miss Cummins,
who taught her botany last year, is to be
married scon. ‘'Is that so!” returned Amy.
I love Amy, bat I do not like ‘‘le that
bo!’- and I hardened on rn get out of its
way; hut as I went along Frank Sullivan
overtook me, and will you believe that
when I a^ked Frank it Mr Stocktui had
really promised to anewtr the (jusstion
‘‘The Lady or the Tiger?” he exclaimed,
“Ib that s>!”
Later in the day I told Mr. Emory that
his playing of the organ lent Sunday had
been much complitmcied, aud he smiled
and murmured, “is that so!""","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86092518/1889-01-28/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,wvu_gore_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Wheeling register.,Lewis Baker & Co.,"Wheeling, W.

Conservative men are oT the opinion that the
number of people destroyed will reach from
12.000 to 15.000. This view of it is based on
many fragment* of evidence obtained from
over 100 citizens, being careful to select as in­
telligent men and women as could be found.
They were chosen from as many occupations
as possible, and from as many social
classes. They were asked to estimate the
percentage of loss to the total population: to
tell how many people of their acquaintance
have disappeared; how the gatherings of resi­
dents on the streets and in public places com­
pare with the same in former times. Their
statements of fact and estimates were proved as
far as could be. and the pendulum of calcula­
tion seems to be beatiug time when they swing
from twelve thousand to fifteen thousand.

It must be remembered that a very large pro­
portion of this loss is made up of children.

CHILD DRUNKARDS.

A, Crusade Aeralnst Wicked Kock-and-
Kye Drops.
No more rock-and-rye candy, or
lrops or wine cordial confectionery,
is the cry of the different branches of
the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union. Tho crusade has begun, and
it will be a relentless warfare. It
started at West Chester, and a big
constable intends to seize all the rock
and-rye drops, and the dealers will be
prosecuted for selling liquor without a
license.
In an interview the president of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union
said: ""If we can do any thing, either
legally or otherwise, tb stop this per
nicious practice, it shall be done. v e
have gone to many of the small retail
candv dealers lately and requested
them to stop the sale of rock-and-rye
candy. Many of them complied with
the request, but it is still manu
factured and sold in large
quantities. Even small bottles of
rock and rve are also vended. We
certainly do object to this feature o
the candy business. Why, all our
children will become premature drunk
ards if it shall be allowed to continue.
When once they get in the habit of
purchasing such articles at candy
stores, they will then take a nip on the
sly in some secluded beer saloon.
""Only the other day a lady friend of
mine, who has a couple of children,
was terribly shocked by seeing them
come from school their eyes all afire,
cheeks inflamed and cutting the most
curious pranks. In great alarm at
seeing them so demonstrative and un
steady she ashed them the cause of
their exuberant feeling. They blub
bered out, laughingly: ""We'se been
eating rock and rye.' There is a great
amount of whisky in this rock-and-rye
candy, and it is of such an in
ferior quality that it easily af
fects those who essay to eat it.
It is a lamentable fact tnat even
candy can not be manufactured with
out placing some Btrong drink in it.
Just look at those wine cordials that
are sold daily to the young by unscru
pulous dealers. There is a pretty little
port-wine drop to suit the palate of
one, there is the sherry drop to please
the taste of another, and so on ad in
finitum. These cordials ought also to
be suppressed. The question to be de­
cided, however, is whether the sale of
such candies without a license can be
proved illegal. If it can we will fight
against it grimly.""
""No one can estimate what evil those
pernicious drops really have on chil
dren,"" said another member of the
Temperance Union. ""I have seen them
after eating it behave very unseemly,
Do you think we can win if we take up
this fight? Well, perhaps we can; but
still that remains to be seen. The law,
like men, is somewhat fickle, and ex
tremely pliable.""
The manufacturers of cordials and
rock-and-rye candy claim that such ac
tion upon the part of the temperance
ladies is a species of fanaticism. ""Why,
if a child could eat ten pounds of rock
and-rye candy,"" said a well-known con
fectioner of this city yesterday, ""it
would not make him or her intoxicat
ed in the least. I admit that there is
some little of intoxicating spirits in
such candy, but it is very small. I do
not suppose there is one-quarter of a
thimbleful of whisky in twenty-five
rock-and-rye drops. These people can
not do any harm to us, and all their
talk is mere twaddle.""
: It is said that the members of the
union intend to investigate just how

saw Mrs. Blaine in this role lately.
She was passing down Broadway when
6he met a lady who returned her quiet
smile of recognition by the rudest of
I-don't-you-know stares. Mrs. Blaine
went on a few steps, suddenly wheeled.
passed by her quondam acquaintance,
and paused before a store window till
the latter came up; then, advancing
with extended hand and a bright
smile, she exclaimed: ""Oh. I beg
pardon for passing you without recog
nition a moment ago; I was lost in
thought till too late."" The exquisite
assurance was irresistable, and the
gloves of punisher and punished
.touched for an instant, when Mrs.
Blaine snatched another laurel leaf by
iadding: ""Pray excuse me I am on
the way to rehearsal,"" and continued
her leisurely walk down the street.
: Quite as prompt and effective was
the action of a thin, keen-eyed woman
whom I saw in the millinery depart
ment of a big store. Spinster was
written all over her face, and a defiance
of age was noticeable in the material
and cut of her wardrobe. She informed
the saleswoman that her bonnet must
be bought then and there. She was
too tired of shopping to go a step fur
ther. The willing but inconsiderate
clerk took down a bonn.t of sober
character, with the remark: ""This, I
think, will please you; it is very suit­
able for a middle-aged lady."" The
spinster quietiy requested her to put
the bonnet on her own head, which the
unsuspecting woman, herself of an un­
certain age, promptly did. Then, look­
ing her full in the face, the irate and
ancient maiden sweetly said: ""It fits
you perfectly, perfectly; you were
right, it is just the bonnet for a middle­
aged person."" The saleswoman bit
her lip and removed the bonnet in
speechless chagrin. She knew her
want of tact had cost her a customer.
The bonnet was sought for elsewhere.
Not less striking, and somewhat
questionable as to good taste, was an
instance of this verbal punishment
that 1 saw while lunching at a fashion­
able restaurant. Two quietly-dressed
ladies, evidently strangers, were at a
table near me, and both had chanced
to call for ohicken-pie. Presently two
3tylish, bustling ladies took the seats
opposite, and one reaching for the bill
of fare and glancing at the plate of
her vis-a-vis. said to her companion: i

""Did you ever try their bonelesschicken-pie?""
""No, 7 was the answer, ""and
I'd rather not, if you please. Nobody
in New York but Delmonico can cook
chicken. Pie here wouldn't be fit
to eat,"" and her handkerchief sent
a perfumed remonstrance tochicken-pie
in the very faces of the
ladies opposite, who continued their
luncheon unmoved, apparently till the
new-comers had settled down to tomato
soup. Then the blow came from the
elder of the chicken-pie consumers in
the remark to aer neighbor: ""By the
way, when you go to Delmonico's again
try their tomato soup. Ther's nothing
in the city like it. I never touch it
since a friend of mind saw a scullion
drop his dish-cloth into the boiling pot
aDd then composedly fish it out, with
no further comment than that it would
color and flavor the soup."" Two spoons
were dropped, and tbe white-faced
creatures with handkerchiefs over their
mouths disappeared in the direction of
the dressing-room. ""Beg your par­
don,"" said the punisher to her aston­
ished neighbor, ""I beg your pardon for
addressing you so familiarly, as I
crave your absolution from my con­
science for the fib I told, - but that
woman needed a lesson, and I think
she has had it."" N. Y. Sun.

HOW GRANT MET DEATH.
His Physician Thinks Illin the Bravest
Man He Ever Saw.
""The bravest person in the face of
death I have ever seen was General
Grant,"" said Dr. Shrady in a recent
interview. ""General Grant in his last
illness was an example of a man who
could face death without fear. Grant
was a man who had faced death many
a time and had schooled himself to ex
pect it
""He was prepared in every way for
it, and I think that every thing that
has been said about his bravery and
his firm determination to be a hero to
the very last has not been exaggerated
at all. To one who saw him during
his trial and it was one of the most
severe trials any one could have he
appeared to be the typical hero.
""He was the type of a thoroughly
well-educated man, who, like all edu
cated men, did not expect impossible
things to occur, and knowing that he
had to die, he faced it bravely. He
said to me one day:
'I have been thinking of taking
this journey all my life, and now that
the time has come I am ready to start.'
""This was the only reference I ever
heard him make to his approaching
end.
""His great idea was to be free from
pain if possible, and he asked me if it
could be guaranteed, thus showing that
his mind was fully made up to the in
evitable character of the disease and
the end that was to come. I assured
him that it wa9 quito possible, and we
kept our promise.
""He died without pain, which was
his reward. He faced the music like
the grand old soldier that he was.
""He was no doubt buoyed up by the
sympathy of his friends. He would sit
and look off in the distance in a sad
and dreamy sort of way, which im
pressed those about him with the fact
that his thoughts were beyond the line
oftime.
""To sum up, he was a type to all the
world of how a man can meet death
with calmness and bravery."" N. Y,

PITCAIRN ISLANDERS.
The Stalwart Descendants of a Gang of
Mutinous Sailors.
When the clipper ship L. Schepp
was beating down in the trade winds
in the dreary waste of the South Pacific
ocean, on her way from San Francisco
to Philadelphia, Captain Gates was
much surprised to find, on coming on
deck one morning, a boat-load of stal
wart men approaching his vessel. An
island was seen a short distance off the
starboard bow, and on the boat getting
within hailing distance an aged and
decrepit man in the bow shouted: ""
am Thursday October Christian, Gov­
ernor of Pitcairn Island.""
He said that the population of Pit­
cairn consisted of 115 men, women and
children. Captain Gates ordered the
yards aback, and in a few minutes
eighteen men were on the ship's deck,
all of whom bore evidence of En
glish ancestry. They were extremely
religious, and held exclusively the
teachings of the Seventh-day Advent-
ists, the result of the work of a mis
sionary who was wrecked there years
ago while bound from San Francisco
to China.
The Governor stated that he was the
grandson of one of the mutineers who,
in 1789, set adrift the officers of the
English war ship Bounty, and then
bore away for the island of Otaheite,
and had lived for years there before
being discovered. Tney were after
ward arrested and sent to England for
trial. The Governor said that the use
of tobacco and liquors was entirely un­
known among the people of Pitcairn,
and that the little colony were in need
of dress goods, particularly for the
women, as nearly all of the latter were
dressed in men's clothes, secured from
passing vessels. A supply of clothing
was given, and an abundance of fruit
and provisions was sent on board the
ship in exchange. Philadelphia Let

and millions of overcoats will stay in
the pawnshops, where they are now,""
said Harry Parker. ""He hasn't got
the idea worked out yet as far as he
will probably go, but he made enough
vests and underclothes last winter to
create something of a panic among the
St. Paul clothiers, where he made his
first business experiment on a big
scale. The paper is prepared so that
it is as soft as cloth, and the cold can
not penetrate it My father is en­
gaged in an open-air occupation, and
like3 to experiment, so he got one of
these vests and wore it with no over­
coat all last winter with great com

In Leed's ""Valley, in the vicinity of
Birmingham, Ala., there is a colony composed
or a religious sect known as the Shermamtes.
There are about 100 families, and a happier,
more contented people can not be found in the
world. Their religious rites and ceremonies
are peculiar. Who founded the society none
of them seem to know, bst it is very old. as the
fathers and grandfathers of the present gen­
eration were Shermanites. They claim to fol­
low the teachings nf the New Testament in
spirit and letter, and they believe that only
Shermanites will inherit the Kingdom of
Heaven. They hare churches aud preachers
and worship in a manner similar to many other
religious sects. One or their peculiar rites is
the washing or feet. A f ootwashlng service is
held once every month, at which the preacher
washes the feet of every member or the church.
The members then in turn wash the feet of the

Kissing Mother.
A father, talking to his careless daugh­
ter, said;
I want to speak to you of your mother.
It may be that you have noticed a care­
worn look upon her face lately. Of course
it has not been brought there by any act
of yours, still it is your duty to chsse it
away. 1 want you to get up to-morrow
morning and get breakfast; and when your
mother comes and begins to express her
surprise, go right up to her snd kiss her
on the mouth. You can’t imagine how
it will brighten her dear face.
Besides you owe her a kiss or two.
Away back, when you were a little girl,
she kissed you when no one else was
tempted by your fever tainted breath and
swollen face. Yon were not as attractive
then as you are now. And through
these years of childish sunshine and
shadows, she was always ready to cure,
by the magic of a mother’s kiss, the little,
dirty, chubby hands whenever they were
injured in those first skirmishes with the
rongh old world.
And then the midnight kisses with
which she routed so many bad dreams as
she leaned above your restless pilow. have
all been on interest these long, long years.
Of course she is not so pretty and kiss­
able as you are; but if you had done your
share of work during the past ten years,
the contrast would not be so marked.
Her face has more wrinkles than yours,
and yet, if you were sick, that face would
appear far more beautiful than an angel 
as it hovered over yon watching every op­
portunity to minister to your comfort, and
every one of (hose wrinkles would seem to
be bright wavelets of sunshine chasing each
other over the dear old face.
She will leave you one of these days.
These burdens, if not lifted from her
shoulders, will break her down. Those
rough, hard hands, that have done so many
necessary things for you. will be crossed
upon her lifeless breast.
Those neglected lips that gave you your
first baby kiss will be forever closed, and
those sad, tired eyes will have opened in
eternity, and then you will appreciate your
mother, but it will be too late !

What a Somerest (Pa.) County Man thinks
of the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical In­
stitute, located at Buffalo, N. Y.

W. H. Miller, of Stoyestown, Pa.,
who has been suffering for nearly a
quarter of a century from an affection
of the kidneys, resulting in the
necessity for a surgical operation,
after consulting and being treated by
a number of our own doctors, as well
as receiving the treatment and advice
of some of the most eminent pro­
fessional men of the land, finally be­
came acquainted with the above In­
stitute, and their mode and means of
treatment. After due correspoudence
with the World's Dispensary Medical
Association, the proprietors of the
Invalids' Hotel, he was induced to
visit said institution. On arriving
there and being fully acquainted with
the abundant means they possess, he
lost no time in making the necessary
arrangements for the required treat­
ment. After remaining for nearly
four weeks at the Invalids' Hotel,
where you receive the kindest and
best treatment, and where patients
are lotli to leave, after recovery, he
returned to his family and friends a
cured and happy man.

In giving this to the public, Mr.
Miller wishes to say that he owes the
aforesaid Institute nothing but his
best wishes. And the fact that his
own success and great relief is due to
similar testimonials from others who
were successfully treated there for all
manner of chronic diseases from
every State and Territory of the
Union, Canada, Mexico and South
America. It is a marvel of success.
He further says, should this fall to
the notice of any sufferers from
chronic diseases, such as seem to
baffle the skill of your own physician
—but first and above all give your
own physicians a fair and","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn91059394/1889-09-04/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,mnhi_ibo_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Morris tribune.,W. J.

Mr. Frank R. Stockton has written
a new and characteristic story called
“The Heriy Chanter."" It will begin
in the November Centuiy and run
through four numbers. The story
takes its name from a vessel which
started from a Massachussets port on a
peculiar cruise. The owners, a young
married couple, are on board, and the
vessel is commanded and manned by
four village captains of unusual experi­
ence. Mr. Dana Gibson will illustrate
it. The November Century is also to
contain a new story by Mark Twain.

London Telegraph.
The old chiefs in South Africa know
nothing about trekking, and on several oc­
casions became so impatient that thoy
started off on foot ahead of the wagons.
One day they had lo walk thirty-seven
miles before reaching water, and then had
to wait two days on scant rations before
we came up with them. One of these men
is seventy-live years old, but the tough old
Zulu (the Matabele rulers are of Zulu ori­
gin) was none the worse for the escapade.
On another occasion, in spite of our warn­
ings, they left us. armed only with assegais,
in the worst part of the lion country. W hen
we followed.a few hours afterward, we saw,
to our horror, that their footprints in the
sand had been partially obliterated by the
Kooor of a lion. Fortunately, however, he
had followed them oulv for some hundred
yards, and then, probably not being hun­
gry, he wandered oil toward a pool of
water.
Such vagaries were to us a source of con­
stant anxiety, for how could we face the
King without bringing back his Indunas?
Our own lives would not have been safe.
We should have been proclaimed as impost­
ors or accused of witchcraft.
However, wo managed to divert their
minds and keep them employed at the wag­
ons bv shooting twenty-six gray monkeys
for them. Tho skins of this particular
species are ouly worn by royalty or big
chiefs.

Weston, W. Va.. April 12. A re­
markable condition of affairs has been
brought about hero by tho recent elec­
tion. A month ago a prohibition coun­
cil and mayor were elected. Their re­
fusal to grant liquor licenses cut down
the estimated revenue for the year nearly
50 per cent. The town had made heavy
contracts for lighting and improve­
ments, nnd tho prohibition council fore­
saw a heavy deficit. In order to escape
tho difficulty tho cntlro council has re­
signed within tho last two weeks, and
nobody can be persuaded to fill their
places. The town is without a govern­

Sarsaparilla
For several mouths I was troubled with
scrofulous eruptions over the whole body.
My appetite was bail, and my system so
prostrated that I was unable to work. After
trying several remedies in vain, I resolved
to take Ayer's Sarsaparilla, and did so with
such good effect that less than one bottle
Restored My Health
and strength. The rapidity of the cure as-
tonished me, as I expected the process to be
long and tedious."" — Frederico Maris Fer-
nandes, Villa Nova do daya, Portugal.
""For many years I was a sufferer from
scrofula, until about three years ago, when I
began the use of Ayer's Sarsaparilla, since
which the disease has entirely disappeared.
A little child of mine, who was troubled with
the same complaint, has also been cured by
this medicine.""— 11. Brandt, Avoca, Nebr.

The females of Ecuador are proverbial
for beauty, those among the aristocracy be­
ing said to have the fairest complexions of
any in South America; while all possess
large, soft and expressive dark eyes, the
blackest and most abundant hair, the
whitest teeth, well-rounded figures, aud
small hands and feet.
Like all women in the tropics, they ma­
ture early and fade quickly; but perhaps
their average span of fortyyears includes
more heart-happiness than comes to women
of colder climes in three score years and
ten, for these are harassed by no ""earking
cares"" or high ambitions. Indolence, re­
ligious superstition, and faithfulness unto
death are their most prominent character­
istics; their passionate natures are com­
pletely satisfied in the love of home, hus­
band and children; and for them the whole
universe lies within the limits of vision.
What higher praise could be bestowed
upon the women of any country ?
To be sure, they are"" notoriously untidy
in dress and habits; but the manta, oe
paneulon, like the mantle of charity, cov­
ers a multitude of sins. As the poncho, for
men, is the universal and most useful gar­
ment for the middle and lower classes, an­
swering for a coat by day, a coverlid by
night, an umbrella wnen it rains and a bas­
ket when there is anything to carry, the
female manta is worn by all classes, and is
equally indispensable, since it hides un­
kempt hair and all defects of toile","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014381/1890-05-03/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,curiv_mojave_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Sacramento daily record-union.,"",Sacramento [Calif.],"","",1474,21302,2740,5173,3,23104,31984,0,curiv_mojave_ver01/data/sn82014381/00175036623/1890050301/0227.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacramento%2C_California,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/curiv_mojave_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82014381%2F00175036623%2F1890050301%2F0227.jp2/pct:6.379848,66.602051,11.859418,16.173712/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/curiv_mojave_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82014381%2F00175036623%2F1890050301%2F0227.jp2/pct:6.379848,66.602051,11.859418,16.173712/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

owls has for two weeks disturbed the peace
of John Mayors home in the outskirts of
Plainfleld The first appearance of the
feathered creatures was noticed by one of
Mr Mayors sons who in romping about
the barn discovered a snug nest
of the young birds There were no
largo owls in sight and tho boy made
one of tho owls captive and carried it to
the house His mother compelled him to re­
store it to the nest He had no sooner placed
it with the others than one of thoolder
birds appeared and attacked him furiously
beating him in the face with its wings and
scratching with its claws and bill at his
eyes Shielding himself with his arms
the lad ran away The owl left him at the
barn door That afternoon one of the
young ladies of the family had occasion to
visit the carriage house when a great owl
flow down and alighted on her back She
shook it off with difficulty and in the
struggle had her garments torn Since
then the owls have taken complete posses­
sion of the outbuildings and their sur­
roundings Scores of the birds which are of
the dayowl species havo followed the first
comers and have made their nest of the
barn Several have been killed but this
seems only to make theothers more fierce
Even men dare not venture near tho nest­
ing places without masks on for protection
The novel defense of umbrellas has been
at last adopted and now when any mem­
ber of tho Mayor family visits the owls
castle he holds a parachute over head
Already three umbrellas have been ruined
by birds dashing against them in their vain
endeavors to each the faces of the carriers
carers
I The Mayor family are in such a state of
mind that they dont want to move out but
they cant dispossess their unwelcome and
belligerent tenants

REASONING WITH REED.
yards of Mount Katahdin, or in some i
clover enameled pasture of the mighty J
Pine Tree State, a great big coarse czar
would be born, whose influence would !
be felt throughout Europe aud as far
back as Rome City. Ind., 1 would have '
hesitated in selecting Maine as a site for
my own birthplace.
Had 1 known that there, where beneficent
sunshine wooes from its hiding place
the scarlet which mantles to the brow of
the wintergreen berry, and where the
crystal sap of tha somber spruce tree
comes forth to gladden the heart and |
stimulate the salivary glands of na- i
tious yet unborn; that in the quiet of

some hotbed of shingles, where the
white birch spool is made, or where ths
scream of the sawmill or the snore of
the shingle mill salutes the balsam burdened
air, would spring up, with blood
in his eye and side whiskers on his front
teeth, a cruel and corpulent czar who
would enjoy biting old people, I would j
have controlled myself and been born :
elsewhere.
Maine is the hotbed of progress and !
American freedom. Everything in Maine j
is free except rum. The work of giving j
to the colored man the divine right of i
voting, as he was requested, was inaugu- i
rated and? assisted in Massachusetts, i
which was then a part of Maine. Free- i
dom has always been a characteristic of j
Maine?freedom to be, to do or to suffer;
freedom to be born there and then
go west to grow up with the country;
freedom to remain there and behave
one's self or go away tosomo other state; I
freedom to fish, cut bait or go ashore, ;
and freedom to utilize her hallowed ;

precincts as ? birthplace, provided they I
be returned in good order as when first |
received.
It is. then, to me a most serious and a |
most bitter truth that comes to me now j
knocking for admittance at the storm :
door of my recently refitted and refur- j
irished temple of reason. It is the great '
sorrow of a lifetime to know that in i
Maine, where the only true, deep and j
earnest dried apple pie of the great work- j
aday world was first discovered, there
should arise a middle aged czar with a !
knont in one hand and an ox gad in the
other, at the end of which is a sharp
brad three-fourths of an inch in length, j
And what is it to be a czar? Ask of J
the blood spattered history of Europe, ;
where yon cannot even trust a hen to
lay for you a pure and noble egg. Ask j
the man whose life is today imbittered

by shivering fears and the chilling hor- ,
ror that even his own long trusted hens
mnst bo watched lest they insert some :
deadly poison in an egg while prepar- i
ing it for use. Ask him at night as ha
cooks his own supper over a kerosene 1
oil stove because he dare not trust the
hand of his slave. Ask him as he unlaces
his sheet iron corset and hangs it '
ou a chair, or jumps into his Mosler
folding bed and screws the copper cov- ;
erlet down ko that people canuot stab
him in the night. Ask him as he runs
his eye carelessly over this column
which I am now writing, and then blots
it out by iiK'an3 of his mucilaginous \
roller and a handful of black sand, re- !
gardless of a deep and earnest kick of
our entire list of shocked aud outraged
subscribers in Ms empire!
This is not in the nature of a threat,
but in order to lead up to the great question
whither are we tending. Is the .
time coming when one man is to have the
responsibility of this mighty government
upon his shoulders? is the day at hand

when one man will have to bo responsible
and have to personally pay all the
bills of the government? Are we to be
ruled by one man who will not even allow
us to think a disrespectful thought
of him without danger of the knout?
Think of ih>> time, dear reader, if it
must come, when a nice, pleasant old
gentleman iike Mr. Holman, of Indiana,
""may heroine the parent of a disrespectful
thought it -yarding the czar. 111 fanvy
I can see William now, brought forcibly
along the aisle, clutching eagerly and
yet impotently at the desks and clothing
of members as he is dragged to the cj^sk
of the speaker, with his tongue hanging
out like that of a hunted stag at a stag
party. Then in fancy I see him compelled
to remove his Prince Albert coat
and vest, and then remove sufficient of
his shirt so that the czar can get at it
with his knout! Then 1 hear the loud
and echoing plunk of the knout as it descends
upon the spinal xylophone of tlio
great Objector!
Oh, it is too terrible to think of! It is
too sad to anticipate! Let us hope that
i \

the day may be longer in coming than '
some of the papers go on to state.
What is the general tendency of the !
hoar in other countries? is it not toward
the dissolution of empires and the dis-j
rnption of dynasties? Most assuredly it [
is. Moreover, the monarchs themselves
are not at all feeling well. The king of ]
Holland is quite ill. His victuals in-!
stead of doing him good seem to be pro-1
ductive of boil in the stomach. He is
often heard to wish that he was dead,
and his staff have promised, so far as
possible, to gratify his every wish.
The king of Spain is a brunette glutton
from quite a distance up the creek. :
He founders himself almost every day .
and then murmurs because he can contain
no more. His doctor's bills, they;
say, would buy a good cow every year.
He hates books and enjoys nothing but
feeding. He takes no interest in his nice
new clothes, but constantly his ear is i
strained to catch the sound of the 12
o'clock whistle, which announces that
the hands at t iie castle have knocked off
for dinner. He then blows off the royal,

digester to a square meal, to use a crude
Americanism.
The king of Dahomey has had both;
his own aiul Lis wife's relations strained,
by Franco, and war is almost inevitable.;
He knows also that it will be one of;
those disagreeable wars in which he will
have the excitement of getting some of
his most indispensable brains shot ont i
without the glory of a victory. Though!
he may think ho is -right, and that it is;
better to be right than to be a relative;
of the executive, he is almost certain to I
get done up by France, and go home |
carrying his largest brains in a collar
box.
The king of Italy formed the foolish
habit of cutting his hair pompadour
years ago, and now he cannot make it
stay down. Over and over again he has
written to mo to know what he should
do in order to destroy or allay at least
that appearance of surprise which his
erect hair gives him. He says his life is
imbittered by it, and that if it were not
that he fears that he would frighten the!
Seraphim he would willingly blow out
the gas and go home.
Pedro II, of Alcantara, made an assignment
last year, and putting his throne

out m tne carnage nouse wiui uunu^s
over it he went abroad, telling the rump
senate and house of representatives to
take their old empire and never to
darken his doors again. When last
heard of he was preparing a magic lantern
slide 1 -ivare on ""How to Reign
with Least Fatigue, and What Style of
Scepter Is Best Fitted for Indoor Reigning.'*
Leopold II, of Belgium, navs that if
he could get the same salary from Phil
Armour for sticking hogs that he does j
for reigning over Belgium he would be in
Chicago early in November, when the
great anniversary and carnival of the
hog assassination of Illinois is at its full!
height, and he would have his clothes
sent to him afterward.
Khulaloukoru 1, ldng of Siam, says
that he would rather run a soda fountain
than be king. He gets all het up in
the middle of the day, and his throne I
fairly aches by 6 o'clock at night.
Muley Has>san, the sultan of Morocco,:
is tirod and sick of his job, and says that;
if V?Q r.rvnlrl tali-o n fpw nf his hftst wives. !

and a shotgun, and a wall tent, and go [
out camping for about eighty-five years j
and let the kickers do the ruling themselves,
he would be willing to do it if he j
could do so honorably, but it's like Jay |
Gould with his money, he says. The
thing has no doubt made a slave of him,
with a big iron collar on his neck that
leaves him never day or night, but curses
him even with the fear that he will lose
it, and not only be again poor and
forgotten, but occasionally raked up
as an example and jeered at by the mob.
That is why, as Muley Hassan says, a
man frequently clings to a throne that
has a Big hornet's nest in the base of it.
He hates to quit, and thus admit that he j
was not indispensable, or give the com-1
mon people a chance to say unjust j
things of him when he is gone. He is j

James Gordon Bennett haa a way d
dropping in to examine the Jfrrald at
the most unexpected times, and as his
visits often result in a general ""shake
up” and reorganization of the paper's
managerial, editorial and working forces,
they are awaited with fear and trem­
bling by bis employees. On one of these
occasions, one of the pressmen, a man
who had worked for the eider Bennett
and was an excellent workman, though
guilty of an occasional lapse from sobri­
ety, bad a black eye, and was in a quan­
dary as to what excuse he should offer
if Bennett noticed it. Acting on s sud­
den inspiration, he seized an ink roller,
and rubbed a daub of ink on the side of
hie face, completely concealing the dis­
coloration of the skin. l*reeent)y Mr.
Bennett came into the press room, and
with the superintendent, John Hays,
went carefully through, criticising every
detail, and looking sharply at every em­
ployee. When about to leave, he turned
suddenly and pointing at the besmirched
pressman, said, ""Mr. Hays, wbst is that
man’s name?” The culprit quaked in
his shoes until Mr. Bennett said,
slowly, ""I want yon to give that man
three dollars per week more wages; he
is the only mao in the room that looks
as if he had been working.”","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88085523/1890-08-28/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,wa_lopez_ver03,"","","",true,ca,The Yakima herald.,Reed & Coe,"North Yakima, W.T.

The cholera scare that has afflicted
Europe to a degree has recalled an incid­
ent of the time when Napoleon III. was
at the height of his power. The cholera
prevailed to a frightful extent at Amiens,
yet never a day passed that the Empress
did not visit the hospitals to superintend,
so far as she could, the noble work of al­
laying the sufferings of the stricken.
One morning a cure rushed into the
ward where the Empress was consoling a
dying man.
“O your Majesty !” cried the cure, “two
hours ago my vicar was breakfasting
with me, and now he is dead!”
Eugenie smiled placidly. “That is
well.”
“Well?” echoed the cure in amaze­
ment.
“Yes, it is well,” she answered. “When
once cholera becomes as violent as that it
ceases.”
The Empress was right; from that day
the plague abated. Eugenie’s valor did
much to fortify the people against the
epidemic to which very many, I am told,
fell victims through sheer fright alone.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87068097/1890-10-04/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,njr_ginger_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Jersey City news.,City Pub.

in a lit of absent-mindedneas, a pair of

was vociferating wildly, and never per­
mitted the opposition to silence his de­
man d.80 a vote bad to be taken, and the
reading of the report was ordered by a big
majority, amid cheers.
, As Hall arose from his seat again the
troubled waters subsided in a most digni­
fied manner, and amid a foreboding silence
be proceeded to say that he had refused to
sign the report of the investigating com­
mittee for the following reasons:
First Because it censured President Polk for
writing tbe Norwood lettei a censure which
was unjust to Polk for various reasons.
V Second Because it exonerated Dr. Macnne,
although Macnne had actually and openly ad­
mitted before the committee that he had
gone to Georgia and formed a com­
bination anion? Alliance legislators and
others In the interest of Patrick Calhoun
for United Htates Senator; because Macune had
alo admitted that Calhoun had loaned him
Macune $2,000, and because Macune had fur­
ther admitted that he remained sixteen days in
Georgia lobbying for Calhoun's election.
Third Because Macune had admitted before
the committee that he had, for the past year,
traveled on transportation furnished him by the
We&t Point Terminal Company.
Mr. Hall, in giviug reasons) with reference
to a ""loan"" of $2,000 from Calhoun, said it
was alleged that Macune admitted before
the committee that he gave as security
therefor an order for $2,000 on the national
Alliance treasury. Troof bad also been
adduced as to- the policy of
the Natioeal Economist and the Geor­
gia Alliance Farmer being in the in­
terests of corporations and monopolists.
This change from the former policy in
favor of the farming interests had been
gradual, but ultimately so marked as to
have practically confirmed the suspicion of

outside financial influence at that time.
Other proofs as to the lobbying and several
minor charges had also bee'n presented.
Tho reading of this document produced a
profound sensation in the convention hall,
and in a few seconds another scene of wild
excitement was being enacted. It was a
fight between Polk and North Carolinia,
backed by their friends on one side,
and Macune and Livingston and
Georgia and their friends on the
other. . Pace, of Virginia, made a
desperate effort even after the reading
of this document to get the whole matter
squashed, and the Polk faction fought
lustily for an exposure of everything the
delegates had a right to know. Finally, as
a sort of compromise, Livingston secured
the adoption of amotion making the con­
tinuance of the investigation a special
order for this afternoon. At one time it
was hoped that tbe matter could be patched
up in some way.
Ab soon as quiet was restored the conven­
tion listened to the report of the commit­
tee to which had been referred that portion
of President Polk's annual messsse suggest­
ing a national legislative council, to con­
sist of the presidents of all Alliances,
with the national president, as chairman
ex-officio. The report was in fa­
vor 1 of this, and"" was adopted by
the convention. The committee on the
president's message with reference to sal­
aries reported in favor of making the pres­
ident's salary $3,000. with traveling ex­
penses, out of which he must pay his pri­
vate secretary, and in favor of fixing his
official residence in Washington. 'I his re­
port was also adopted. The action in both
instances was in direct opposition to the
recommendations of Dr. Macune in his offi­
cial report. The afternoon adjournment
was at 5:30.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015679/1890-12-07/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,in_ashbel_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Indianapolis journal.,Douglass & Conner,Indianapolis [Ind.],"","",21284,2764,9740,46380,4,37536,51228,4,in_ashbel_ver01/data/sn82015679/00295870424/1890120701/0350.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indianapolis,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/in_ashbel_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82015679%2F00295870424%2F1890120701%2F0350.jp2/pct:56.702899,5.395487,25.948423,90.536425/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/in_ashbel_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82015679%2F00295870424%2F1890120701%2F0350.jp2/pct:56.702899,5.395487,25.948423,90.536425/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

A Northern Hoodoo.
Slug No. 4 was a pretty good printer
and a jolly fellow outside when the last
form had gone down. But he was a
southern man, and he couldn't, to save
his life, get rid of the dialect of the darky.
""I doan't know how it is,"" he used to
say, ""but yo' fellahs seem ter see sumpin'
bcry sahprisin' about the way I talk.""
The boys in the same alley used to have
a good deal of fun with No. 4 and his
dialect, and one day they teased him so
that, dropping a stickful of agate type,
he turned upon tho one nearest to him,
and raising both hands exclaimed:
""I cuss yo'! I cuss yo'! I cuss yo' till
de hoodoo gits yo'!""
That was all very funny for the boys,
but the strange part came three weeks
later, when the ono who had been
""cussed"" was discharged for cause. He
""subbed"" around for a couple of days
after that, but couldn't find work again.
It looked as if the hoodoo had caught
him.
Slug No. 4 was treated very respect­
fully after that. Somehow the boy3
didn't like thct hoodoo business. It was
too uncanny for them. New York Even­

Honesty.
Eugene Smith, secretary of the New
York Prison association, tells a remark­
able story of the answer a thief gave to
the question, ""Is honesty the best iol­
icy?"" It was in the Elmira reformatory,
where a class was undergoing instruc­
tion. A young man asked permission
to answer the question. ""I believe hon­
esty is the best policy,"" said he, ""be­
cause of a case where I knew it to work
that way. See? There was two young
fellows in New York and they was
crooked, see? and they didn't succeed.
They went to Philadelphia, and they
turned over a new leaf and agreed to be
square aud honest. They opened a cloth­
ing store, see? and they prospered. They
got everybody's confidence, and they bor­
rowed ?100,000 to enlarge their business,
and then they failed and got away with
every cent of the money, which they
never could have done if they hadn't
been honest. See?' San Francisco Ar­
gonaut. Kemarkable Memories.
There was a Corsican boy who could
rehearse 40,000 words, whether sense or
nonsense, as they were dictated, and
then repeat them in the reversed order
without making a sile mistake. A
physician, about sixty years ago, could
repeat tho wholo of ""Paradise Lost""
without making a single mistake, al­
though he had not read it for twenty
years. Euler, the great mathematician,
when he became blind, could repeat the
whole of Virgil's ""-.-Eneid."" and could re­
member the first hue and last line of ev­
ery page of the particular edition which
he had been accustomed to read before
he became blind- Spare Moments.

require no shelter throughout tho year
and no feed beyond what they get on the
open plains. It is true that the sunny
sky may cliango to a sky of brass, and
that drought is the dread of the Austral­
ian shoplierd, herdsman, and farmer.
Occasionally tliero is a succession of dry
seasons and then sheep have perished by
millions and cattle by thousands on the
more remote stations, To master recur­
ring droughts is the great problem of
Australia's inland future. Here, as else­
where, naturo challenges man's free ad­
vance, and places somo special obstacle
in his way. Australians are facing their
task with energy, confidence and promise
of much success. They have learned the
art of drawing wealth even from scrub
land of which a single sheep requires
several acres for its support. Irrigation
works on a large scale have been begun
in Victoria and South Australia. The
storage of water in reservoirs is beiug
carried on in a large way by municipali­
ties and private companies. Throughout
New South Wales and Queensland the
boring of artesian wells has met with
sstisfactory success. Once given the cer­
tain means of carrying the fiock and the
herds through the occasional periods of
drouth, there seems to be no limit to the
pastoral capacity of such immense prov­
inces as New South Wales aud Queens­
land. With completed systems of irriga­
tion Australia promises to become one of
the greatest fruit and grape growing
countries in the world. The many diffi­
culties with which men aro confronted
on this great continent are more than
matched by its wonderful possibilities.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn99068076/1891-02-06/ed-1/seq-3,"","",3,"","",1,sdhi_falcon_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Kimball graphic.,Kimball Pub.

Nothing seems to burn into tbs memory and
heart of a child as an undeserved punishment,
however trifling the matter may seem to the
adult inflicter. In some children of the sunny,
hopeful type the wave of indignation aud help­
less, unspoken protest against unjust correc­
tion passes away, and leaves apparently co
trace. To other children, with more sensitive
natures or more rebellious dispositions, unjust
words of reproof kindle fires of rage, which
smoulder with sullen persistence under the
ashes of seeming forgetfulness, ready to burst
out violently and unexpectedly. If this seems
an overdrawn picture one has only to think
backward to one's own childish days, and to re­
call the time when careless treatment by an
elder first taught us to be bitter, unforgiving,
resentful.
A child's sense of justice is as keen as bis
heart is tender, and this is one of the qualities
most necessary to a coble character; a quality
that must be blended with truth and honor and
self-sacrifice to give the right balance to dispo­
sitions which would otherwise work barm. A
child's justice is always tempered with mercy
to those he loves, and when in the home he is
justly and tenderly dealt with, be learns little
by little that higher sense of justice toward all
with whom he comes in contact. When his
own small rights are carelessly and continually
thrust aside, he, too, learns to play the brigand,
to invent devices to achieve the might which
he has learned makes right.

Jerry Unfit FortresaeL In RomI,
Some extraordinary reve!:vt ions bave jnrt
been made nt St. Petersburg as to the man­
ner In which certain frontier fortresses re­
cently constructed, and, as it was sup­
posed, strengthened, have actually been
built. It appears that even in thi perilous
flild of enterprise the jerry bnilder has
tjen reaping a rich harvest. At two Bep­
fcrate fortrewes hfo frauds have been de­
tected. A commission of revision on in­
specting tbe walls of the celebrated Ftrong­
hold Novo Georgievf b, formerly known as
Modlin, and situated between Warsaw and
tbe German frontier, found that tho newly
constructed outer walls were not more
substantial than those of a piece of theat­
rical scenery.
A thin onter lsyer of half bricks con­
cealed a hopelessly rotten fabric composed
of the verieat rubbish gravel, brick dust,
sand and chalk tbe whole being utterly
incapable of withstanding a cannonade by
guns of the smallest caliber. Thee facts
having been reported to the minister of
war, the chief constructor of the fortress
was arrested and tried by court martial,
but be escaped with so light a penalty as
dismissal from the service, it having been
proved that be snffereJ from a painful af­
fection of tbe eye. The chief constructor
of tbe fortress of Doubno, the other strong­
bold concerned, was not so fortunate. The
fort rees was inspect ed by the Grand Duke
Nicholas shortly before bis illness, and ho
found tbe walls built so contrary to the
rules of military engineering that they
were incapable of affording any real de­
fense against modern engines of war.
In accordance with tho report which be
made to the emperor on the snbjoct, an
order was issned that tha whole of the
walls in question should bo razed to their
foundations and rebuilt. The chief con­
structor solved tbe problem of his own
punishment by blowing out Lis brains,
and all his subordinates who were in any
degree responsible were sent to Siberia.
Every endeavor ba, of course, been made
to keep those occurrences from tbe knowl­
edge of the public, but tbe fact of the tax
have come to hand through a thoroughly
trustworthy channel. Leeds Mercury.

to its construction and operation. ,
As staled, there was but one main rail; it
was an iron one, although there were two
auxiliary wooden ones. This rail rested on I
strong wooden beams, which were supported
by massive stanchions, strongly braced.
About two feet below the top beam a ere
two wooden rails about eight inches in width
which were securely nailed to the support­
ing stanchions. These wooden rails were
chiefly for balancing-purposes. The height
of this oddity among railroads varied, being
sometimes 25 feet and sometimes less than
half that elevation, according to the "" lay""
of the cruuud in tlm pleasant little valley of
Fo*tsr Brook, through which it ran. There
was method in the apparent madness of
this construction, however, for;without this
elevation the original aud peculiar scheme of
the inventor would not have been possible.
Tne cars fitted on the rail like saddle­
bags, bunging down on each side, aim were
really two-stury cars, the upper portion be­
ing for passengers and the Dig wooden sad­
dle-bags for tlie storage of freight. Tho
stilted rail* and th« peculiarly constructed
cars, which seemed to slide along as if on a
groove, presented a sufficiently grotesque
sight, but the strange appearance of a train
was increase a and iutunsilied by the fact
that practically two engines, or a specie* of
Siamese twin engines, headed the proces­
sion, one being on each sid« of the rail, the
two balancing like the divided cars. When
the hrenjiin ""staked up"" he had to descend
to the tenders by ladders. The engines and
the cars ran on a scries of central wheels,
and as they protruded through the center of
the floors ar ranjiements were made by which
they did not inconvenience passengers. The
cars were narrow, the main rail broad, and
whenever the car tilted there were side
wheels which caught on to Ills wooden rail!

and unexpected dismissal is one of the
most dramatic incidents in political
history.

The central idea in the critical re­
view of Bismarck's career, made by
Dr. Geffcken in this article, is set forth
in the following extract:

The true test of the highest order of
statesmanship is its degree of success
in forming a school. Such statesmen
were Pericles, Csesar, Charlemagne,
Lord Chatham, Washington, Pitt,
Stein, and in our days, Cavour. When
they died they left successors able to
continue their work, and the reason
is that they believe in institu­
tions rather than in men.
With Bismarck in was the reverse
he always adhered to the Csesarian
system—the ""on a who un­
dertakes to think lor the whole people.
To govern was, according to his
idea, not to persuade, but to com­
mand, and representative government
was to command •with a flourish oi
speeches, which should always end in
a subserviency to the ruling minister.
In fact, his opinion was, Empire
c'est moi,"" and enemies ol the Em­
pire were always those who opposed
his policy of the hour, his imperious
nature rebelling against all control.
Such a man could form no school as
soon as he saw a rising talent he press­
ed it into his service or crushed it.
Therefore when he was dismissed,
Germany had able diplomatists and
administrators, but no statesmen.

He represented the corruption as
well as the absolutist tendency of an
order of monarchy at is now every­
where dead except in Russia.

On the other hand, the young
Emperor, as described by Geffcken,
in spite of his strongly military
utterances, recognizes the tact at h«
is a constitutional monarch. An out­
line of the portrait of him, drawn by
his Privy Councillor, is as follows.

William II, is undoubtedly the most
remarkable so^fcreign of the present
tinle. He is a modern man, notwith
standing certain proclivities which still
adhere to him, like pieces of the shell
of an egg from which the bird has is­
sued. With restless activity he seizes
upon all questions A\ Inch agitate oui
time, be they large or small. Today he
speaks on great European affairs,
opens new issues to German commerce,
and proclaims social reform tomor­
row he opens an art exhibition and
takes a personal part the perform­
ance of Wildenbruch's patriotic dra­
ma, ""The New Lord."" presides
over his Council and shows himself a
ready debater, opens a scholastic con­
ference, laying down his educational
plans, and indefatigably travels all
over his country in order to see every­
thing with his own eyes. Much in all
this may be attributed to his activ€
temper, but the moving principle is un­
doubtedly the high conception ol
his duty as ""th first servant
of the state."" This conception is
bound up with a strong consciousness
of his eminent position he feels him­
self to be the pillar of the state called
to carry out a great mission. As be­
fore the dismissal of Bismarck he said
at he would crush any one trying
to obstruct his path, so he declared
in his last speech at Dusseldorf
""Only one is master in this country
I shall suffer no other."" I would be
unjust to see in such utterances,
caused by high consciousness of his
power, absolutist tendencies on the
part of the Emperor! He is a consti­
tutional prince and hasrigidly respect­
ed parliamentary rights. Bu in a
time when the principle of authority
and is undermined in many
ways, the youthful sovereign feels that
he is the centre of monarchical dis­
cipline, without which the State can
neither exist nor progress, and he is
resolved to maintain his authority
against Social Democrats as well as
against interested coalitions of priv­
ileged classes and persons.—The For­

MORSES FOR FARMERS.

Many Seek n flenornl rurpose Horso, Set
Never Obtnln It.
Strictly spealting a general purposa
horse is ono that can do everything
that a horso is called on to do. It is
impossible in tho nature of things for
a horso to bo so constructed that ho
can do everything. A horso to be a
general purpose horso should combine
all tho qualities of a runner, a trotter,
a pacer, a roadster, a coachcr, a sad­
dler, a hunter and a draft horse, also n
ladles' driving horse and children's
pony. Tho greatest value in a horso
comes from his possessing some partic­
ular quality, or combination of qual­
ities in the same line, and the ability
to do ono thing and do it welL The
better adapted a horse is to one thing,
tho more valuable ha is.
Tho view that farmers take of a gen­
eral purpose horse is ono that will bo
heavy and strong enough to do all the
work on tho farm and at tho same
time combine cnouirh soecd to make a
good road horse, both single and
double. No doubt such a horso is val­
uable on a farm. We have seen somo
horses that would worlc with any
horso on the farm, draw two tons singly
on a good road and then, with a rest of
a day or two. get out on tho road and
travel eight miles an hour and a milo
in three minutes or better. Such a
horso is an ideal farm horso for mos'
eastern farmers. Not one farmer in
1,000 owns such a horse and not
one horso in 100,000 can do that. The
general purpose horso as found on
tho farm is nearly worth­
less in tho great markets. They are
too light for any draft work, not fast
enough for roadsters, not large enough
for coaehers and so they are sold for
8100 or $125 to go on the street car or
grocery wagon. Tut 200 pounds more
weight on him and he will do for draft
work and bring twise as much money.
Add two incites more to his height and
draw his head up a little higher by
training when he is a colt and he will
do for a coacher and bring three times
as much. Ube a butter sire and dam
and get your horse to drive well and
easy and go in three minutes or less
and he is worth four times as much for
a roadster.
The majority of farmers on a 100­
ncrc farm keep three or more horses.
For farm horses they should secure
mures that weigh at least 1,100 pounds,
and 1,200 pounds or more is better. If
these marcs are strictly of tho draft
type, they should be bred to a pure­
blooded draft stallion of good weight
and size, and the colts will be worth
something to sell. Or if the mares are
tall and not so blocky they may be
bred to a good coach stallion with a
view of raising coaehers. One or two
horses weighing 1,000 or 1,0.10 pounds
apiece could be kept to do the driving
and at tho same time they would be
useXul in drawing the mowing ma­
chine, hay rake, cultivator and doing
other light farm work. The sooner
farmers get out of the idea of trying
to raise a general purpose horse and
go in for a special purpose the more
money they will make from their farms.

A New Use for a Watch.
St. Lonls Globe-Dcmocrat.3
If you are to sleep in a strange bed and
there is a suspicion of damp about the
sheets lay you watch between them and
either smoke a cigar or read awhile. Then
take out the watch and if there is any film
or mist on the glass, don't go to bed, of if
you do, sleep between the blankets, which
are never damp. Hundreds of drummers, and
especially men past youth or middle age,
take this precaution and profit considerably
thereby.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024546/1891-09-27/ed-1/seq-18,"","",18,"","",1,pst_eisenhower_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Pittsburg dispatch.,"Rook, O'Neil & Co.",Pittsburg [Pa.],"","",6300,24860,2636,2044,18,23560,28896,4,pst_eisenhower_ver01/data/sn84024546/00237282061/1891092701/0289.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pittsburgh,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/pst_eisenhower_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84024546%2F00237282061%2F1891092701%2F0289.jp2/pct:26.740238,86.032669,11.188455,7.073643/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/pst_eisenhower_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn84024546%2F00237282061%2F1891092701%2F0289.jp2/pct:26.740238,86.032669,11.188455,7.073643/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

wonderful is man, aud it might be
added, how ""more so"" is woman.
With her peculiarly delicate aud in­
tense organization, she is the superla­

she excels him, having many that he
has not. She has, however, found
out a grand remedial agent for the
cure of her diseases in Dr. Tierce's
Favorite Prescription, a medicine
suited to her nature, made for the ex­

all weaknesses incidental to mother­

been much advanced, and it is hoped that he­

In view of the reports which bad been re­
ceived as to the dimitiui ion of the seal herds
in Helirin;r se;, I dee ned it wise to propose to
her majesty's uovernnicnt in February last
that an agreement for a closed season should
be made, in-ndint; the negotiations for arbi­
tration which then seemed to lie approaching
a favorable conclusion. After much corre­
s.IMn. Knee, and del ivs for which this govern­
ment was not responsible, an agreement was
reached and signed on the 15th of June, by
which (Ireat Mrituin undertook, from that
date and until May 1, lS'.fJ, to prohibit the
killing by her subjects of seals in the Behring
sea. and thetfoverninent of the United States,
during the same period, to inforce its existing
proidbities against pelagic sealing and to
limit the catch by the fur seal company upon
tlie islands t . 7..D skins.
Concerning ISounriariea.
l'rovision should be made for a joint de­
marcation f the frontier line between Can­
ada and the United States, wherever required
by the increasing border settlements, and es­
pecially for the exact location of the water
boundary in the straits and rivers.
1 should have been ulad to announce some
favorable disposition of the boundary dispute
between (ireat Britain and Venezuela, touch­
ing the western frontier of British Guiana.but
the friendly efforts of the United States in that
direction have thus far been unavailing. This
government will continue to express its con­
cern at any appearance of foreign encroach­
ment on territories long under the adminis­
trative control of American states.

is easily attainable by amicable arbitration,

STARED AT BY THE DEAD.
A TWO DAYS' VIGIL KEPT
BY A CORPSE.
Alone, Unattended, Desolate
—An Experience Possible
to So Many Others.
Early one morning recently the guards on
the elevated road In New York noticed a
middle-aged man apparently kneeling beside
an open window. Although it was a raw
ana cold morning his head was uncovered.
His eyes seemed to be staring Intently across
the street. All day Ion?, as the traius thun­
dered past, the man seemed still to be watch­
ing, and even when night came on a glimpse
of a white face could be seen staring out into
the darkness. The next morulas, the guards
were all on the lookout, a d still the man
could be seen with his chin resting on the
back of his hand. •'■'■

Coroner Donlin, who chanced to be look­
ing out of the ear window during the day.
saw at once that it was no common face
that Blared at him. He left the train, went
to the house, and there found, kneeling by
the window, the stiffened corpse of a man.
For two days he had kept the vigil of the
dead. Awaking in the night alone and
oppressed, he had struggled to the wiudow,
and gasping for breath, had died. The cor­
oner's examination revealed the fact
that death had been caused by Bright's dis­
ease of the kidneys, which came unan­
nounced, sudden and sure.
Sad ! Yes, but bow common have these
sudden deaths become. They give no warn­
ing. There is a Quick paiu, a struggle, and
all is over. Statistics show that 90 per cent
of these sudden deaths are caused by kiduey
disease. Slowly but surely these great organs
have been decomposing, and when the
climax comes it comes without warning.
But there were warnings. The -..range pains,
peculiar sensations and unaccountable feel­
ings were nature's warnings. They may
have been considered only the symptoms of
a cold, but all the while the 'disease was
working and death surely approaching.
Can nothing be done? Yes. exercise care.
Act promptly. Use something to sustain the
kidneys. Do. as so many prominent physi­
cians are advising their patients to do. take
Warner's Safe Cure. If this great prepara­
tion which has saved so many men and
women from death by Bright's disease were
not a well-known household remedy and the
most popular in America we might hesitate
to fo warmly Indorse it, but being the only
absolute specific for this great modern dis­
ease it is commended most unhesitatingly.
This entire page could be filled with state­
ments from prominent physicians in both
Europe and America of what the Safe Cure
has done to lessen Bright's disease, prevent
female complaints and check the great phys­
ical evils of modern life. It is no ordinary
mediciue, but a scientific discovery wnich
has received more commendation than any
other discovery of the","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059522/1892-01-08/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,mnhi_faribault_ver01,"","","",true,ca,St. Paul daily globe.,St. Paul Globe Print.

One of the loveliest dogs ever bred, one
of tho gentlest and most loyal, has ly some
curious misapprehension of bis qualities
fallen into such disrepute that tbe Legisla­
ture of th? 'State of Massachusetts has
enacted a statute which makes it a misde­
meauor for any one td keep a clog of tbi
breediug within tho confines of the com­
monwealth. This is the blood-bound, which
is generally supposed to follow the trail
of men, and, catchincc thorn, to rend their
human victim, limb ffomlimb. If tiiiswere
toe characteristic of the dog, I should not
blame tbusewho have contributed to his
disrepute, lint a a matter of fact, a well­
bred and welMrained blood-hound would
no more think of jumping upon and biting
bis quarry than would a pointer soring
upon the pheasant.' or partridge he had
scented. His business is not to kill game,
bnt to find it. I have seen a man-hunt in
the hills of Vermont, the only place where
tbe pure Knelisb blood-hound is bred, and
when tbe dogs came up with tbe men they
had trailed they only showed delight at
their success, and, by their cessation from
barking, indicated to th huntsman that
they had found their same, i have heard
it said that Mrs. 8towe,ln her ""Uncle Tom's
Cabin."" did much towards bringing upon
the blood-bound his disrepute. To see if
thin were so. I read over Mrs. Ktowe's book
recently, and was surprised to find that she
only once alluded to blood-hounds in all her
highly-colored narrative, and never a
single time brought them on the
scene. She had other objects iu view,
without going out of her way to malign
a family of dogs. lint those who drama­
tized Mrs. Stowc's story nsed the blood­
hound with great realistic eOeot, and cone
of the wandering troupes which have
played this drama nag been so poor that it
has not bad a pack of dogs. Bnt 1 have
never known a troupe to have a pack of
real blood-hounds. Instead, they have
mongrels of various kinds, but always mon­
grels that looked savage and bloodthirsty.
The blood-hound is not only not savage, but
does not look so. On the contrary, he is
amiable in disposition and bas a singularly
dignified and benevolent expression","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015679/1892-01-24/ed-1/seq-6,"","",6,"","",1,in_beveridge_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Indianapolis journal.,Douglass & Conner,Indianapolis [Ind.],"","",16044,27052,4472,9936,6,37000,48448,4,in_beveridge_ver01/data/sn82015679/00295870497/1892012401/0238.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indianapolis,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/in_beveridge_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82015679%2F00295870497%2F1892012401%2F0238.jp2/pct:43.362162,55.837186,12.086486,20.508587/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/in_beveridge_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82015679%2F00295870497%2F1892012401%2F0238.jp2/pct:43.362162,55.837186,12.086486,20.508587/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

Qrders.
Washington, Feb. 16. Although the
verdict of the court martial in the case
of Major Charles B. Throckmorton, who
was tried in New York some weeks ago
on charges of duplicating his pay ac­
counts, will not be officially announced
until the President has formally acted
upon the papers, it has become pretty
generally known throughout the War
Department that the sentence is dis­
missal.It is reported, however, that ' the sen­
tence is accompanied by a recommenda­
tion for mercy signed by all the members
of the court. This circumstance, cou­
pled with the officer's long service and
the trmenduous amount of influence at
work in his behalf, will probably spare
him the loss of his commission.
: It is generally expected the President
will mitigate the sentence to two or three
years' suspension on half orthree-quar-1
ter pay.

How AVIUibet Hcif ConvUled.

One of the theories of the age was that
the devil set his mark upon each of his
iervauts--that witches were all marked,
A jury of the sex of the accused was ap­
pointed to examine the body for such
marks. It often happened that some ex­
crescence of flesh common to old people,
pr one explainable by natural causes, was
found. One such was found on the body
Of Goody Nurse and reported to the
frwrt, all but one of the jury agreeing to
the report. Rebecca Preston and Mary
Tarbell knew that the mark was from
natural causes. The prisoner stated to
the court that the dissenting woman of
the jury of examination was one of the
most ancient, skillful and prudent, and
further declared, ""I there rendered a
sufficient known rejwson of the moving
cause thereof."" She asked for the ap­
pointment of another jury to inquire
into the case and examine the marks
found on her person.

The jury of trials returned a verdict
of not guilty. Thereupon all the ac­
cusers in court ""cried out'' with renewed
vigor and were taken in the most vio­
lent fits, rolling and tumbling about,
creating a scene of the wildest confusion.
The judges told the jurymen that they
had not carefully considered one ex­
pression of the prisoner, namely, that
when one Hobbs, a confessing witch,
was brought in as evidence against her
she said: ""What, do you bring her? She
is one of us."" The jury retired for fur­
ther consultation. Even then they could
not agree upon a verdict of guilty.
They returned to the courtroom and de­
sired that the accused explain the re­
mark. She made no resjkonse, and the
jury returned a verdict of guilty.—New
England Magazine.

Barbarian Dee Communities.

The so called queen bee is really the
mother of the hive. Her functions are
maternal rather than regal. If she may
be said to reign in a certain sense, the
workers rule, deciding all questions and
performing all acts affecting the com­
mon weal. Populous and powerful bee
communities sometimes relapse into
barbarism, renounce the life of peaceful
industry for which they have become
proverbial, acquire predatory habits and
roam about the country as freebooters,
plundering the smaller and weaker
hives and subsisting on the spoils.

Theee brigand bees seldom reform if
they busily ""improve each shining hour""
it is not to ""gather honey all the day
from every opening flower,"" but to
range the fields in looting parties and
ransack the homes of honest honey
makers. Against these marauders of
apian society and other foes the honey
bees often fortify their hives, barricad­
ing the entrance by a thick wall, with
bastions, casemates and deep, narrow
gateways. When there seems to be no
immediate danger hostile attack these
defensive works, which seriously inter­
fere with the ordinary industrial life of
the hive, are removed and not rebuilt
until there is fresh occasion for alarm.

A Departure in Telephaaqr*

The manager of the telephone ex­
change in Lisbon achieved distinction
some time since by connecting the royal
palace with the opera house at a time
when the king was in mourning. The
telephone man also connected his own
house with the transmitters on the stage
of the opera, and had wires with receiv­
ers attached all around his drawing
room. On opera nights he used to in­
vite his friends to enjoy the performance
at his house, and it was a curious sight
when some ten or twelve people were
sitting about the room in comfortable
armchairs with receivers to their ears­
head telephones were used, so that there
was no necessity of holding up one's
hands all the time—and listening atten­
tively without uttering a sound beyond
an occasional exclamation of delight or
surprise.-- Elec«ricity.

Beranger the famous French poet,
whose greatest gift lay in writing little
poems which he called songs, was par­
ticularly dependent upon the chance
visits of the muse.

He was once visited by the author and
academician, Viennet, who said to him:
""You must have written several songs
since I saw you last.""
""I have only begun ana,* answered
Beranger.
""Only one! 1 am astonishedr ac­
claimed Viennet.

Beranger became indignant.
""Humph!"" he shouted. ""Do you think
one can turn oft' a song as one turns off
a tragedy?""—Youth's Companion.

Stage Struck.

Two men met on a train going west,
They had known each other in the six­
ties and resumed acquaintance with a
vim,

‘“An how's that bright boy of yours?
asked the city man of his old time friend.
“Peart, peart as ever, pard. I were
goin to make a minister of him, but he
got stage struck and took to that line as
nat’ral as a duck does to water, an I had
to gin in. And he’s the best shot in
Montany.”
“Took to the stage, eh? And has he
been successful?”’

‘“Successful? Well, I reckon he hez.
Why, their ain't a man can be named
in the same day with Bill. He kin drop
8 grizzly in his tracks without ever
eomin down from his perch,”
“What is his role?”

“Roll? I don't savey, pard.”
“I mean what line is he in?’
“‘Oh, the Mounting an Valley line that
runs to Goochville through Catamount
Grove and Grizzly Hollow. 'Taint fun
all the time either, pard, when bandits
is layin low for yer money or yer life.”
“Ah, he does the semsational on the
boards. Isee. A low comedian.”
“Nothin low abont Bill, ole friend.
He just sits up on the top of the Mon­
tany stage an drives his four-in-hand as
easy as rollin off alog. Ez I said, the
stage wuz right in his line, an he'’s a
thunderin good driver.”--Detroit Free

The Baby and the Savage.
In the bomne caves of the south of
France have been found figures of rein­
deer, mammoths and men cut on horn
‘ or ivory, and evidently executed by art­
‘ ists contemporary with the Elephas
| primigenius. The men are represented
| with short, bent legs, and seem to stand
] or walk in a stooping manner, with the
| body bowed slightly forward from the
| hips,
Now pass your hand down the back of
any infant under ten months old and
feel the spine at the loin or lumbar re­
gion, where in the adult modern man
the back is hollow or concave. You will
observe that in the babe it is convex
like that of a quadruped (a ten-month­
)old baby is practically a quadruped);
and though the child can, perhaps, get
on its legs with the support of a chair,
it does mot straighten its thighs and
stand upright, but is bent forward in the
same posture of the cave dweller, whose
portrait has come down to us from the
age just succeeding the last glacial
epoch. If the support is removed the
child falls forward and again decomes a
pseudo quadruped.—Blackwood’s Maga­","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88085722/1892-06-17/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,wa_heron_ver02,"","","",true,ca,Fairhaven herald.,Fairhaven Pub.

Rule in Ireland.
Chicago, June 22.—The report of the
platform committee was as follows:
Section 1.- The representatives of the
Democratic party of the United States,
in national convention assembled, do re­
affirm their allegiance to the principles
of the party as formulated by Jefferson
and exemplified by the Ion? and illus­
trious line of his successors in Demo­
cratic leadership from Madison to Clove­
land. We believe the public welfare
demands that these principles be ai>­
plied to the conduct of the federal gov­
ernment through tho accession to power
ot the party that advocates them, and
v.. solemnly declare that the need of a
return to these fundamental principles
of a free popular government, based on
home rule and individual liberty, was
never more urgent than now. when the
tendency to centralize all power at the
federal capita! has become a menace to
the reserved rights of the states that
strikes at the very roots of our govern­
ment under the constitution as framed
by the fathers of the republic.
The Force Bill Infamy.
See. 2. We warn the people of our
common country, jealous for the pres­
ervation of their tree institution^, that
the policy of lateral control of elections
to which the Republican party has com­
mitted itself is fraught with the gravest
dangers, scarcely less momentous than
would result from a resolution practi­
cally establishing monarchy on the
ruins of the republic. It strikes at the

Sunstroke Stops of 70 a;ic| gfl.
A marriage was interrupted Thursday
night by the groom becoming suddenly
overcome with the heat and he had to
be taken to his hotel, where he has been
confined to his bed ever since.
The groom in qnes&on is Mr. W. S.
Fowler who boards at the Enterprise
hotel. Until a short while ago he con­
ducted a livery stable on East Market
street, but retired about a year ago with
a comfortable fortune. Mr. Fowler is
a widower, seventy-five years old, and
has several grown children. A short
while ago he met Miss Lillie Townsend,
a young woman twenty-five years of
age, who is employed by J. Bacon & Sons
at the glove counter.
The courtship did not last long till the
engagement was announced. Mr. Fowl­
er's children, it seems, objected strongly
to the marriage and did everything in
their powor to break off the match. They
were unsuccessful, however, and June
15, the day set for the marriage, arrived.
The wedding was to take place where
Miss Townsend has boarded for several
years. Everything was in readiness at
the time appointed—the guests, the min­
ister and the happy couple.
Just before the time for the ceremony
Mr. Fowler bocame very faint and
would have fallen but for the support of
one of the guests. He dfcon lost con­
sciousness and was taken to the Enter­
prise hotel in a carriage, where he was
put to bed and the doctor summoned.
His condition was found not to be seri­
ous, but he was suffering from a slight
case of sunstroke.—Louisville Courier-
Journal.
An Imprisoned Genius.
Alberto Lopaz, who was taken to
Yuma recently to serve a two years'
term for burglary gave his personal ef­
fects to his friends about the jail.
Deputy Barry was presented with a fac­
simile of the Episcopal church made
out of pasteboard. Lopaz could see the
church from one of the jail windows,
and he reproduced it almost perfectly.
He borrowed a knife from Deputy Sheri­
dan with which he cut up the paste­
board, and then mado paste from flour
with which to stick the pieces together.
It is a piece of workmanship to lie proud
of. The greatest production of Lopaz
while confined in jail here is a reproduc­
tion of the magnificent Merchants' ex­
change building in Guadalajara. The
entire affair is constructed of paper.
On tho inside of the building aro the
stairways, etc., each perfect in its con­
struction. The prisoner must be pos­
sessed of a memory much stronger than
moßt men are, to remember every detail
of that large structure for a number of
years. However much genius the man
possessed, he has made bad use of it.—

Troublesome Seals*
The salmon fishermen down the river
and bay are having trouble tips spring
from the seals, as usual. These pests
are multiplying rather than decreasing
and aro causing great losses to the weirs.
While the seals of the arctic regions
have the reputation of being slow,
stupid animals, hunters killing them
with clubs, those on the Maine coast
are the sharpest game to be found.
They will go in and out of the salmon
weirs, either by force or strategy, and
eat all the fish they want. They are
very hard to get a shot at, and when hit
sink to the bottom, the carcass thus
being lost to the gunner. One fisher­
man remarked on a recent Saturday
that there was a small fortune in store
for the man who would invent a trap
that would catch seals and hold them.
The bounty upon them doesn't seem to
do a bit of good.—Bangor (Me.) Com­
mercial.
No Buyer for Riklelgh's Youghall House.
Sir Walter Raleigh's Irish home in
Youghall, County Cork, which belonged
to the late Sir John Pope Henuessy, M.
P., was put up for sale by Messrs. E. &
H. Lumley, in the Auction mart, To­
kenhouse yard. The house is a fine
specimen of Elizabethan architecture.
It was there that Sir Walter smoked
the first pipe of tobacco in Ireland and
received an unexpected bath from a
faithful servant maid, who, on seeing
the blue smoke emerging from her mas­
ter's mouth and curling around his head,
thought Sir Walter was falling a victim
to spontaneous combustion and threw a
pail of cold water oyer him to extinguish
the conflagration. Only £1,250 was bid
for the property, which was according­
ly bought in by the auctioneer, who
said he could not think of selling a his­
torical mansion like it for such a figure.

Telephone from Turin to Rordeoux.
At 8 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
new telephone line between Paris and
Bordeaux was opened. Complimentary
messages were exchanged between the
presidents of the chambers of commerce
of both cities, and the minister of com­
merce, and the mayor of Bordeaux. The

elhO than in New York. Now, when
a man is riding in a street ear a pret
ty faco is always a ""cheering sight

lovely faces to contemplate tho joy
is proportionately Increural.
Sereno enjoyment was depicted on
tho faco of every man in the car
Forgotten were all tho ordinary

cares that infest tne any. no man
wm in a hurry to reacli his dustina
tion. In fact thero was much inward
rejoicing at tho lack of rapid transit.
Into this temporary ulxxle of bli&s
hopped a shrill lunged newsboy
When ho perceived that not a man
on tho car had a newspaper his eyes
lighted with joyous expoi t'icy.

ly and gleefully. ""Full account of

Cut tho men only scowled at him.

""Wot'sdo matter wid tie Mokui""

leaping off tho platform.
""Can't you seo?"" replied tho con
ductor, contemptueusly: dey's tuk

An old woman entered tho car.
She was fat and Blie was homely,
and she waddled rather than walked.
No man rose to givo her a seat.
Each man felt that hii; neighbor

might bo harboring some Rich mten
tion and teared to anticipate him.
Tho old woman waddled to tho end
of tho car, heaved a sigh and caught
on to a strap.
""Pray tako my seat, madam,"" said
ono of the prottiest of tho pretty
girls, rising.
""Oh, thank you, ma'm,"" roplied
tho old woman, gratefully; ""but it's

a shame to deprive you of it. If 1
wasn't so old but perhaps ono of
tho gentlemen will give you a Beat.""
""Indeed,"" said tho pretty girl, smil­
ing, and thoroby making herself look
moro be wi telling than ever, ""1
couldn't think of accepting ono from
any of thorn. They ai o nil so dread

Half of tho dozen men had started
simultaneously to rise. Thoy dropped
back into their soats looking sheep­
ish and dejected. And tho half

dozen that hadn't begun to rise
looked equally unhappy. A chaiiRO

had como o'or tho spirit of their

dreams. A pretty face is not a cheer­
ing sight to seo when you know
that it's owner entertains a very
small opinion of you. And every
man in that car felt that ovory worn
an in tho car, including tho ono who
was old and fat, held a cheap opinion
of him. Instead of seeking tho pret­
ty face opposite, thur eyes fell on
tho door.
Another newsboy boarded the car.
""Extreol extree I"" ho yelled. ""Full
account of do 'orriblo disaster 'u aw
ful loss of lifo.""
Ho didn't havo to yoll a tecond
time. Eveiy uutn was in a hurry to
read that talo of disaster; so much so
that thoy all actually buried thoir
faces bohiud their newspapers.
And tho pretty women all ex­
changed smiles and looked very
much tickled at something.
""Golly I"" Raid tho newsboy to the
conductor, ""1 struck it rich that
timo, didn't I?""
""You hot,"" said tho conductor;

is tho largo and extensive circulating

contains as good a collection of books
as can bo scon on the shelves of a

President Harrison Designates the

24th of November.

Washington, Nov. 4.—The presi­
dent has issued his annual Thanksgiv­
ing proclamation as follows:

By the President of the United States
of America—A Proclamation.

The gifts of God to our people durinir
tin' past year have been so abundant
and so special that the spirit of devout
thanksgiving awaits not a call, but only
the appointment of a day wlien it may
have a common expression. He has
stayed the pestilence at our door. He
has given us more love for the free civil
institutions in the creation of which
His directing providence was so con­
spicuous; lie has awakened a deeper
reverence for law; lie has widened our
philanthropy by a call to succor the dis­
tress in other lands: fie has
blessed our schools, and is bringing
forward a patriotic and God-tear­
ing generation to execute His great and
benevolent designs for our country.
He has given us great increase in ma­
terial wealth, and a wide dillusion of
contentment and comfort in the homes
of our people; He has given His grace
to the sorrowing.
Wherefore, 1, Benjamin Harrison,
president of the United States, do call
upon all our people to observe, sis we have
been wont, Thursday, the 24th day of
this month of November, its a day of
thanksgiving to God for His mercies,
and of supplication for His continued
care and grace.

form bo important a
part of tho dny's cere
monies and services - that it is called
Floral Sunday almost as frequently as
by its ,more special title. As that do­
notes, it is n-day given over to services
by tho children and for tho children, and
that it is the dearest Sunday in tho year
to them is evident to every ono who has
watched thorn from tho morning hours,
when they give their sweetly earnest at­
tention to a Bermon prepared especially
for them, until in tho evening they
proudly march in to tako tho front seats
in""th church and go through their protty
ezc qfo s and songs.
Cnjren always lovo to havo things
that are ""their very own,"" aside from
mere toya und clothes. To possess what
seems to bo tho right of adults fills the
soul of a child with joy. It is nothing
uncommon for a boy or girl to own
books, and to them it is no great treat
because all children havo them. But
givo them little bookcases to keep thoir
books in, and how delighted they arol
A bureau, too largo for a doll, but not
moro than half as largo as grown folks
uso, is perfection to any httlo maiden.
And as soon as a child is given a room
of his own to sleep in, how ho love3 to
keep it nice and accumulate decorations
for it!
It must be this inherent love for what
usually belongs to older peoplo that
makes children regard their special Sun­
day with such affection. They will work
liko beavers bringing flowers -which, to
their regret, they are too small to ar­
range, and will run errands more willing­
ly for those who are trimming tho church
than thoy -would on uny other day in the
year.
On this floral occasion of course many
lessons are drawn from flowers. They
are used to illnstrato many a point in a
sermon and as symbols of many a vir­
tue. But there is ono plan -which,
trange to 6ay, has seldom if ever been
adopted by tho churches, which would
not only do much good when Children's
day comes, lut would teach the children
some practical as well as some moral
lessons. That is to distribute among
the members of a school flower seeds
which they are to plant and care for as
each variety needs, the object being to
bring tho growing plants on tho follow­
ing Children's day to decorate tho church
and afterward to bo distributed where
they will do the most good.
The lessons in floriculture gained in
learning how to pare for the flowers will

sults of one's own labor much more valu-

able. New seeds can bo given each year,
or it may be specified when tho first are
presented that the children will bo ex­
pected to propagate them themselves by
cuttings or seeds, thus continuing year
after year.
The set floral piece, emblematic of
some religions thought, is sometimes
considered an important feature of Chil­
dren's day, though many churches do
not havo it at all. For those that do,
theso suggestions, old and new, may bo
of use. A set design to bo built of flow­
ers is an expensive thing, as it must be
mado to order, and each part so arranged
that, when filled with flowers, it will fit
in its placo easily. A floral harp, its
framo of flowers and its strings of fine
green vines, is a very lovely design. A
miniaturo church is another, also a light­
house, an anchor or a book mado of
flowers.
A ladder, each round bearing some
word or motto significant of an aspiring
or upward climbing life, is a somewhat
newer dovico. Tho ladder uprights may
bo of green and may bo standing in
placo before tho exercises begin. The
topmost round may bo marked ""Love,""
and with its placing may bo sung the
hymn cemmencing:
Saviour, teach me day by day
Love's tv, ect lesson to obey.
A largo bar of music, all of whoso
notes aro mado of flowers, hung in placo
on tho green strings that form tho bar,
is a now and effective design. Almost
any praiso song will bo suitable for this.
A ship of flowers is always a beautiful
sight. If ono is built on the platform, a
cea of green may bo mado around it, or
It, may liavo a platform of flowers on
which to stand, tho platform being con-,
ttructed under it after the ship itself is
done. Tho songs, ""Out on an Ocean All
Boundless Wo Bide"" and ""Jesus, Saviour,
Pilot Me Over Life's Tempestuous Sea,""
are suitable for such an emblom. A
Jargo banner of flowers may bear the in­
scription, ""Hia Banner Over Me Was
Lovo,"" and may bo put together to the
singing of ""Jesus Spreads His Baruw
O'er Us,"" and
Etand up. stand up for Jesus,
Yo soldier of tbe cross;

Children's dayl""
To open founts of learning our church invites
hur youth;
From sin and error turning, sho bids them gain
tho truth!
Then crowd tho school and college, heed wis­
dom's beckoning ray;
Oh, may a thirst for Lnowlcdgo bo roused this
Children's day!
Not songs alone, but giving, will Jesus smile
secure.
In this, like him, we're living who for our sake
was poor.
We o.ter now our treasuro, and on h!s altar lay
Both hearts and gifts with pleasure on this bat
Children's day!
Children.
Como to me, O ye children! i
For I hear you at ) our play.
And the questions that perplexed me
Have vanlshod quite away.
Ye open the eastern windows
That look toward tho sun,
Whero thoughts are singing swallows
And the brooks of morning run.
In your hearts are the birds and the sun­
shine,In your thoughts the brooklets flow.
But in mine is the wind of autumn
And, the first fall ot tho snow.
All! what would the world be to us
If the children were no more?
Wo should dread tho desert behind u
Worse than the dark before.
What the leaves are to the forest,
With light and air for food,
Ero their sweet and tonder Juices
Have lieen hardened into wood,
That to tho world are children;
Through thorn it feels tho glow
Of a brighter and sunnier climate
Than roaches the trunks below.
Come to me, O ye children!
And v. lilspcr In my car
What tho birds and tho winds aro singing
In your sunny atmosphere.
For what are all our contrlvings
And the wisdom of your books
When compared with your caresses
And tho gladness of your looks?
Ye are hotter than all the ballads
That ever were sung or said,
For ye aro living poems,
And all the rest are dead. '
Longfellow,
Children's Jane Song.
Little ones, let u be happy together
In this beautiful world of ours!
Let us be glad tn this sweet June weather,
With the birds and tbe breeres and flowers,
With tho grass and the earth, with the sky
and the sun­
Let us be glad in the summer begun!
There are praises rising, and prayers are
springing
From spirits and bodies today.
Harkl Faith with a chant and a carol Is wing­
ingHer flight up the heavenly way.
Let thought unto thought -with the sweetness
ring!
Little ones, open your hearts and sing!
For a loving life breathes a fragrance dearer
To God than the breath of a rose,
And the song of-the soul has a melody clearer
J han,,tbe jark.or the linnet knows.
And ever he leans from tho silence dim
And walta for tbe music you make to him.
Little ones, let ns be part of the story
Of Joy that the world has to tell!
Let ns bloom In the beauty and sing of the
glory
Of God, who has loved us so well!
Lotus givo him ourselyss, for to, himw be­

The Moral Effect of Children's Pay,
The custom of observing Children's
day with programmes arranged wjth a
view of impressing upon tho tender
mind tho fact of immortality and hop
has obtained for. several years.The-little,
ones look forward with pleasantanticipation-
to the Sabbath whenrjthey
shall bo the attraction and the older
peoplo shall pay tribute. Beautiful dec­
orations and interesting programmes
have their effect upon the undeveloped
minds, and i every child is better when
Children's day with its garlands of
flowers, the string music of a band, tht
march in the bright sunshine, the soft
breath of spring bringing sweet odors
from Cold and wood, all conducing to
happiness, health and purity has come
and gono. .
Tbe White Snnday.
In Switzerland Children's day has
gained tho pootical name, ""Dcr Wcisse
Sontng,"" or White Sunday. Tbe time
set apart is always the first Sunday after
Easter. There appears a pleasing signifi­
cance in this selection. The story of
hopo that Easter brings of the risen
Christ and the awakening spring is in
harmony with the general rojoicing of
human souls standing at the beginning
of lifo's journoy.
Memories of Tooth.
Impressions made on youthful minds
linger, liko the ""scent of the rose,""
through long years of a busy, perhaps
sinful, life. Instances aro not rare of
hardened criminals being brought to a
senso of their degradation through hear­
ing somo long forgotten melody of their
youth. Tho observation of Children's
day can but leavo memories that will
sweeten and purify the later life.
Let Children's Day Ho Joyous.
Children's day should be made a joy­
ous occasion to both old and young.
Beligious training is necessary for chil­
drea, but it should be associated with
the bright and beautiful, as the infantile

BUILDING THE FLORAL WALL.
If desired, a more elaborate oxerciso
may be mado of this by having a floral
xeall built on a framowork made ready
beforehand. Each pupil brings a block
made, of either greens or solid colored
flowers, in the center of which is the
word italicized in his or her speech. The
first speaker may put in placo a row of
blocks of green as a sort of foundation
for tho wall.

Some tijlth massive deeds and great.
Some with ornaments of rhyme.
Nothing useless Is, or Ion ;
Each thing in Its place is best,
And what seems but idle show
Strengthens and supports the rest.
For the structure that we raise
Tlmo is with materials filled;
Our todays and yesterda) s
Are the blocks with which we build.
Truly shape and fashion these;
Leave no yawning gaps between;
Think not, becauso no man sees,
Such things will remain unseen.

A well known Wall stroot hrokor,
whoso otlico is in tho Schormerhorn

place in Ilia private ollico a littlo ploco
ol paper which evon upon tlio ""street""
ia regarded as a groat iimiucial curiosity.
It is a check drawn upon a Now

has been certified.
It is a rulo with all banks that wbon

upon a chock drawn by n depositor,
tliut there are sttfilciont funds in the
bank to meet the check when presented
for payment, ho doos so with the understanding
that the chock, if not used and
returned to tho bank through tho ordinary
channel of business, tho clearing
houso, shall bo re-deposited as though
it wore cash by tho drawoo. If a certified
check fails to lind its way buck to
the bank on which it is drawn the paying
tellor's daily sheet, and eoasequently
the books of' tho bank will not balr
unco.
This four cent dorolict?tho bank accountants
probably have a stronger
name for it?hai now boon ""out"" sevoral

cause of irritation to tho bank peopto,
who must now of necessity take a balanco

Tho toiler would probably hold
it ami givo a ""cashier's check"" for a liko
amount in place of it. If the paity
didn't liko that ho could tako cash?or
do tho other thine.
The bank would most likely pay a
considerable Droniiiitn to sot hold of

Perpetuation of Phyaleal Defects.

Diseases of malnutrition, such as gout,

scrofula, cancer and tuberculosis, re­
quire several generations for their full
evolution, and this evolution may be re

tarded or even wholly arrested by inter­
marriage with healthy persons of an

other nonrelated family. Acquired con

stitutional taints and abnormal habits,

as alcoholism, kleptomania, when once
firmly rooted in an individual organism

tend to propagate themselves lileo fam

ily features and become hereditary for
several generations, even when the origi

nal factors have ceased to act. Thus
the acquired habit of the father may be­
come a natural feature in his son or

daughter, just as the puppies of a well

trained pointer or setter require but very
little training to ""point"" or ""set.""

Deformities, superfluous digits or toes

and malformations in general may be
caused by accident to the mother, by
powerful mental impressions arresting
or altering the development of the un­
born child, and the child born with any
of these defects may become the parent
or grandparent of an infant having an
exactly similar abnormality. Homceo-

The success which attended the use of
the electrio light in fishing off the Cali­
fornia coast has led to the devising of
various improved apparatus for that pur­
pose. One of these consists of a large
iron frame Interlaced with netting, which
can be opened and closed at the will of
the operator. An electrio light incased
in a lantern is lowered into the net, the
electricity beiug furnished by a motor
in the bow of the boat. As the boat
moves along the network is thrown open,
and the bright light of the lamp, which
is seen at a great distance in the clear
water, arouses the curiosity of the fish,
which readily swim into the trap. This
is the modern variant of the old method
of destroying fish from a canoe by torch­
lightExchange","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87078321/1893-07-19/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,pst_hetzel_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The star.,C.A.

"" Te Deum in E Flat"" was rendered by

troduced to the audience President
Cleveland, who spoke as follows:
While I accept with much satisfac?
tion the part assigned to me on this oc?
casion, I caunot escape the sober reflec­
rions which these ceremonies suggest.
Those who suppose that we are simply
engaged in commemorating the begin?
ning of a magnificent structure devoted
to important public uses, have over?
looked the most useful and improving
1 lesson of the hour. We do indeed cele?
brate the laying of a corner stono from
which has sprung the splendid edifice
whose grand proportions arouse the
pride of every American citizen ; but
our celebration is chiefly valuable aud
significant because this edifice was de?
signed and plauned by great and good
men, as a place where the principles of
a free representative government would
be developed in patriotic legislation for
the benefit of a freo people, If repre?
sentatives who here assemble to make
laws for their fellow countrymen forget
the duty of broad and disinterested
patriotism.and legislate in prejudice and
passion or in behalf of sectional
and selfish interests, the time when the
corner stone of our Capitol was laid
and tho circumstances surrounding it,
will uot be worth commemorating. The
sentiment and the traditions connected
with this structure and its uses belong
to all the people of the land. They are
most valuable as reminders of patriot?
ism in the discharge of public duty and
steadfastness in many a struggle for the
public good. They also furnish a
standard by which our people may
measure the conduct of those chosen to
serve them. The inexorablo applica?
tion of this standard will always sup?
ply proof that our countrymen realize
the value of the free institutions which
were designed and built by those
who laid the corner stone of their
Capitol, and that they appreciate the
necessity of constant and jealous watch?
fulness as a condition indispensable to
the preservation of these institutions
in their purity and integrity. I be?
lieve our lellow citizens have no great?
er nor better cause for rejoicing in this
centennial, than is found in the as- 1
surance that their public servants who
assemble in these tails will watch and
guard the sentiment and traditions that
gather around this celebration, and
that in the days to come those who
shall again commemorate the laying
of the corner stone of th< ir nation's
Capitol will lind in tho recital of our
performance of public duty no less
reason for enthusiasm and congratula?
tions than we find in recalling the wis?
dom and virtue of those who have pre­
ceeded us.
After the President's adiress theie
was music. Then the orator of the
day, William Wirt Henry, of Virginia,
delivered an oration which was both
lengthy, learned and ornate. The
""Star Spangled Banner"", sung by the
grand chorus, followed, after which
Vice President Stevenson made an historical
aud interesting address. The presiding offi?
cer of the Senate was followed by Speakir
Crisp.whose remarks were brevity itself.

losing his life. On one occasion he was
nearly frozen to death outside Billy Mc­
Glory's notorious dive. On another oc­
casion he was so brutally beaten in a
Water street dive that he was supposed
to be dead. The morgue wagon was
called by the police, and the bruised and
battered body, apparently dead, wascar­
ried to the morgue. When it, or rather
he, arrived there some of the doctors
made the discovery that Jimmy still
lived, and so he was taken to the hos­
pital, where he remained four months.
His last narrow escape from death was
when he drank a quantity of spirits cf
wine which he found in a cellar. Jim­
my drank so much he went raving mad
and tried to hang himself. He was sent
to prison for three months for attempt­
ing suicide.

ThefirstSaturday afternoon inMarch,
1890, Jimmy started out to have some
amusement, and hearing that the Salva­
tion Army, which had justarrived from
England, was going ""to show"" at Harry
Hill's notorious resort he concluded to
go there and see what kindof peoplethe
soldierswere. Whenhe arrived at Hill's,
he found that there was an admission
fee, and he, with a drunkard's tconomy,
determined to spend the price of admis­
sion in a different manner. Toward
night he strolled into a dive in Water
street, where his Whyo friends painted
his back and served his face the same
way and wound up the performance by
rolling the unfortunate man in the saw­
dust of the dive floor. Jimmy, after sub­
mitting to their treatment, thought they
would let him stay there all night but.
alas, they kicked him out on the street.

Just as Jimmy reached the sidewalk
his cap blew off and fell into an ash bar­
rel which was standing near the door of
the den. Jimmy tried to recover it, bnt
in doing so lost his balance and fell head
first into the barrel. He struggled to
get out, but ail his efforts were in vain.
He seemed to be there to stay.

A short time after Jimmy's acrobatic
feat a policeman came along, and seeing
a man's legs in the barrel set to work to
discover who was the owner of them
and why he had them in such a position
He took out his club and struck the in­
verted man on the soles of his feet.
These means are sometimes resorted to
by policemen to arouse drunken men.

From the depths of the barrel came a
voice which the policeman atoncerecog­
nized. He rapped for assistance, and
when another officer appeared on the
scene an effort was made to get Jimmy

been driven through the barrel. They
pulled until the old rotten shoes gave
way and were left in their hands. The
policemen then threw the barrel down
on its side, and laying holdof the unfor­
tunate man's feet they dragged the bar­
rel and its howling occupant toward the
policestation.

A pitiful sight was poor Jimmy when
he reached the station. His face, which
bad been blackened by the toughs in the
dive, was all battered and bruised, and
the paint on his face, mingled with
blood, was strongly. suggestive of a
scalped Indian. His clothes were all
torn and his shoes gone. How complete
the ruin! How perfect the wreck!

his conversion, since which time he has
served faithfully in its ranks.—Boston

A STRANGE ""WILL
It Brought Fortuno and Happines3
to Two Lovers.
Yen, she wa dcml at last Mnrparpt
Dcmorc&t, of Stony Lodgo nnl tho
shock of her demise had shuken Hello
rue from center to circumference. Kor
years her numerous relatives, each
with an eye to the estate, had watched
her movements from a respectful dis­
tance, which she herself hail interposed
between them, tind their hearts had
(frown sick with hope) deferred
Heart disease, tho doctors said, when
he was found one morning1 with a
smile of peaco frozen on her stern and
withered features. The relatives ac­
cepted the verdict with due resigna­
tion, following tho remains of the ""dear
departed"" to their final resting place,
amid an ostentatious display of crape.
But when the will was read tho excite­
ment of the heirs-at-law rapidly
ascended to fever heat. Always eccen­
tric In life, Miss Demorest had retained
that eccentricity to the end and woven
it into her last will and testament
With the exception of a few bequests
to her servants, tho whole of her prop­
erty, landed and personal, to wit:
Stony Lodge, her present residence,
with its beautiful park, which was a
very Eden of loveliness; Rose Villa, her
winter resort on Lake Helen, Flo., to­
gether with a splendid house in town
and money to the amount of five hun­
dred thousand dollars, was to pass Into
the sole possession of that one among
her kinsfolk who should discover tho
hiding place of the twelve Demorest
rabies.
Should the gems remain undiscov­
ered after the lapse of one year from
the date of death the estate was to be
Bold and a home for old maids founded
with the proceeds.
""The old cat!"" muttered fashionable
Mrs. Meredith, viciously. ""She hid
those rubies herself, the spiteful
thing!""
""It is too provoking!"" pouted her
pretty daughter Maude.
""I shall contest the will,"" said thin­
lipped Reuben Gray. ""It cannot
stand.""
Mrs. Meredith was Miss Dcmorest's
niece and Keuben Gray her nephew.
The two were brother and sister nnd
the nearest akin to the dead woman.
Next catno Marpio Vane, child of a
favorite nephew, who was to have been
the heir had he not displeased his ount
by marrying against her will a pirl of
obscure parentage ""a pauper,"" Miss
Demorest called her.
Harold Vane had died some years
back, closely followed by his wife, and
the one daughter, Margaret, was left
alone in the world and utterly penni­
less.. Mrs. Meredith had taken her for the
old aunt had remained obdurate and
she was now serving in the capacity of
maid to her beautiful cousin Maude.
. Margie Vane was not present at the
reading of the will. Mrs. Meredith con­
sidered it unnecessary, and Margie her­
self had not the faintest hope of being
remembered kindly by her father's
stern old relative. When, therefore,
they returned in anger and disappoint­
ment and gave an account of the word­
ing of the will Margie's hazel eyes
opened wide with wonder.
That afternoon and many ensuing
afternoons Mrs. Meredith, Maude and
Margie walked over to Stony Lodge and
wandered fruitlessly about amid tho
treasuresof bric-a-brac, statuary, books
and rare old china.
On one of these occasions Margie met
Will Demorest a cousin several times
removed of her father. He was a
frank, handsome young fellow, with
dark blue eyes and close, curling, fair
hair. His was the genuine Demorest
face, the index of a strong, noble char­
acter.Ity occupation he was an artist in
glass-blowing, having learned the art
in Venice. He had done considerable
work for Miss Demorest with whom ho
wia:i a prime favorite.
""So you thought you would have a
look for tho rubies with the rest of us,""
said Mrs. Meredith, with a sneer, na
she found the young glassblower exam­
ining the books in the library one
morning. ""Vet I thought you abhorred
mercenary considerations.""
' ""I am not in quest of the gems,"" Will
replied, as his eyes rested in unmistak­
able admiration on Margie's fair, sweet
face.
""Humph! I hope you don't take me
for a lunatic or a fool, Will Demorest,""
was the scathing rejoinder.
""For neither, I assure you,"" said Will,
with a bow. ""Only at present I lira
more interested in pearls than rubies.
Cousin Margie, may I show you the
house? I believe 1 know it moro thor­
oughly than most people,""
Margie shyly acquiesced, and the two
went off together, leaving Mrs. Mere­
dith and Maude to continue their search.
""Are you anxious to find the rubies
also?"" asked Will, as they paused in the
china closet to admire the cut glass.
""I have not even looked for them,""
answered Margie, with a bright smile.

The bulls used for fighting purposes are a
specially-selected, specially-cared-for class.
They are all pedigreed, says the Gentleman’s
Magazine. Andalusia is especially the dis­
trict of the hull. Here, at the age of one
year, the young bulls are separated from the
heifers, branded with the owner's mark, and
turned out loose on the plains to graze with
others of their own age. When a year older,
the young bulls are gathered together, in or­
der that their mettle and fighting qualities
may be tested. One of them is sejiarated
from the herd, and chased by a man ou horse­
back, who, by the skillful use of a blunted
Innee, overthrows the escaping bull, where­
upon another rider comes In front of the ani­
mal with a sharper lance, to w ithstand the
expected attack. If the bull, on regaining his
feet, attacks the rider twice, it is passed as a
fighting animal; hut if he turns tail and
runs off, then it is set aside to be killed, or to be
used In agricultural work. And so with each
animal, until the whole herd of 2-vear-olds
have been tested. Each bull that has stobd
the test successfully Is then entered in the
herd book, with a description of its appear
ance. receives a name—such as Espartero,
Hamenco. and the like. This process of care­
ful selection gees on from year to year until
the bull is 5 years old, when, should its met
tie still prove true, it is ready for the arena,
and flaming posters appear on the walls of
Madrid or Seville announcing that Espartero
(or whatever his name is) will on such and
such a date make his first and final appear­
ance. A good warrantable” 5 year-old j,ull
for the fighting rings costs from £7O to £BO.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86063034/1893-10-27/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,gu_drew_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The morning news.,J.H.

the retreat of the invaders across the
Sutlej and the surrender of Lahore to
the British. By the terms of the peace
Dhuleep Singh, the infant son of
Runjeet, was recoenized as rajah.
The second Sikh war broke out n
1848, but it proved to be short-lived, the
British forces under Lord Gough suc­
ceeding in destroying the Sikh army
and in annexing Punjab to the queen's
possessions. As a result of this war
young Dhuleep Singh received an
allowanceof £50.000fromh is conquerors.
He,with his mother, moved to England,
became a Christian, and on his estate in
Suffolk cultivated the Habits of an Eng­
lish gentleman. He was an intimate
friend of the Prince of Wales, who used
annually to spend part of the snooting
season atDhuleep's country home.
The maharajah's first wife was a
little Syrian maid whom he met in Cairo
in 1863, when on his way back from
Bombay, where he had gone to take
back to its native soil the body of his
mother, that it might be there cremated.
The maharanee died in ISS7, and a
couple of years later—in May, ISB9—he
married in Paris Miss Ada Douglas
Wetherill.

Dhuleep watched closely the advance
of Russia into Asia, and when he
thought the proper lime had come he
renounced Christianity and issued a
manifesto to the Sikh nation claiming
the throne of hia father. But his
renunciation of the creed of Baba
Nanukand his suspected illegitimate
birth—it was asserted by the Sikhs
themselves that he was the son of his
mother through an intrigue with one of
the rajah's water carriers—had lone:
since estranged the feelings of the
people, and if. it had been possible to
a Sikh rebellion in the Land of
the Five Rivers there were other princes
better than this maharaj&h to lead such
an enterprise.
The British made. short work of his
pretensions. He was traveling with
leisurely dignity on his great mission
In a P. and O. steamer,when at Aden he
was informed that a return passage
had been secured for him. and that he
would not be permitted to land in India.
A Sikh rebellion would have been a
serious matter for England, for never
were the British forces more evenly
fought then on the battle fields of
Mooltan, Chillianwallah and Ghuzuee.
; There were at that time about ten regi­
ments of Sikhs in the Indian army, ac­
knowledged by British officers tol)e the
finest in the service, and in most of the
Punjab regiments there was a very
large proportion of Sikh soldiers.
After his abortive astempt to stir up
the Sikhs into rebellion against British
rule, Dhuleep went to Russia, think­
ing to enlist the sympathy of the czar
In his behalf, but his greetißg was not
orer warm. So the king without a
country established himself in cos­
mopolitan Paris, where ne lived up to
toe time of his death. Life on the
continent seemed to unsettle somewhat
the dtmi^stic morals of this Oriental
Christian, and an hereditary predis­
position to polygamy asserted itself.

FINE, RELIABLE CLOTHING

Dhuleep. While he was staying in
1871 at Sandringliam with the Prince of
wales, the maharajah was of the party.
One morning Taylor arose early and
strolled out into the grounds to a* small
summer house in which there was at
Hindoo idol broueht back from India by
the prince. As he came near lie saw
some one, who proved to be Dhuleep,
standing in front of the idol executing
certain movements, evidently of wor­
ship. The truth probably is that Singh
never had abandondea the true faith of
his fathers.
The religion of the Sikhs was founded
by Nanuk, who died A. D. 1535, and
who left for the guidance of his fol­
lowers an Inspired volume bearing the
very uneuphonious title of the
""Grunth."" This book is held in great
reverence-aiul is carried every morning
in solemn state to the Golden Temple of
Immortality at Atnntzsir, where it is
venerated by some 3.000,000 or 4,000,000
people. When Europeans visit the
temple they are required to removed
their shoes. An exception, however,
was made in the case or the Prince of
Wales, for whom a special pair of boots
was manufactured by Sikh shoe­
maker. SiKhism is a form of philosophy­
intended to be a compromise between
Sun Mohammedanism and Hindoo
mysticism. The Sikhs don't worship
idols, but they reverence, if not wor­
ship, their sacred book, portions of
which are read by priests from early
morning till sunset fcr the spiritual In­
struction of the people who visit the
temple.
The tomb of Runjeet Singh, the
father of Dnuleeo, is at Lahore, the
capital of the province of Punjab. It is
a white structure with a dome and five
minarets.Ruujeet's mausoleum is In the
center of the building, under the dome.
Oh the top of the tomb is a white rose
surrounded by five white lilies carved
in stone. The white rose is lv memory
of the great rajah, and the lilies that of
his five wives who threw themselves
on his funeral pyre. The mother of
Dhuleep Singh declined the honor of
being burned alive.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059522/1893-12-03/ed-1/seq-17,"","",17,"","",1,mnhi_mankato_ver01,"","","",true,ca,St. Paul daily globe.,St. Paul Globe Print.

mas services. Standing before the or­

44 The Star of Bethlehem."" Text, Rev­
elation sxii, 16, ""I am the bright and
the morning star.""
This is Christmas eve. Our attention
and the attention of the world is drawn
to the star that pointed down to the car­
nvansary where Christ was born. But
io not let us forget that Christ himself
was a star. To that luminous fact my
text calls us.
It seems as if the natural world were
anxious to make up for the damage it
did our race in furnishing the forbid­
den fruit. If that fruit wrought death
among the nations, now all the natural
product shall become a symbol of bless­
ing. The showering down of the wealth
of the orchard will make us think of
him whom Solomon describes as the ap­
ple tree among the treesof the wood, and
the flowers of tangled glen and cultured
parterre shall be the dew glinted gar­
land for the brow of the Lord Jesus.
Yea, even the night shall be taxed, and
its brightest star shall be set as a gem
in the coronet of our holy religion.
Eavo you ever seen the morning star
advantageously? If it was on your way
home from a night's carousal, you saw
none of its beauty. If you merely turn­
ed over on your pillow in the darkness,
glancing out cf the window, you know
nothing about the cheerful influence of
that star. Bat there are many in thft
house tonight who in great passes of
their life, some of them far out at sea,
have gazed at that star and been thrill­
ed through with indescribable gladness.
That star comes trembling as though
with tho perils of the darkness, and yet
""bright with the anticipations of the day.
It seems emotional with all tenderness,
its eyes filled with the tears of many
sorrows. It is tne gem on the hand of
the morning thrust up to signal its com­
ing. Other stars are dim, like holy can­
dles in a cathedral or silverbeads-counted
in superstitious litany, but this is a
living star, a speaking star, a historic

star, an

star bright and

brilliant and triumphant symbol cf the
great Eedeemer. The telegraphic oper­
ator puts his finger on the silver key of
tho electric instrument, and the tidings
fly across the continent. And so it S3erns
to me that the finger of inspiration is
placed upon this silver point in the
heavens, and its thrill through all the
earth. ""Behold, I bring you good tid­
ings of great joy which shall be to all
people. Behold, I ara the -bright and
morning star."" The meaning of my
text is this: As the morning star pre­
cedes and promises the coming of the
day, so Christ heralds the natural and
spiritual dawn.
In the first place, Christ heralded the
coming cf the creation. There was a
time when there was no order, no sound
or beauty. No wing stiired. No word
was uttered. No light sped. As far as
God .could look up. as far down, as far
out, Ihere was nothing. Irnmeasnreable
solitude. Height and derail and length
and breadth of nothingness. Did Christ
then exist? Oh. yes. ""By 'him were all
things made that are jnr.de: things in
heaven and things in earth and things
under tho earth."" Yes, he .antedated
the creation. He led forth Arcturus and
his sons. He shone before the first morn­
ing. His -voice was heard in the con­
cert when the morning stars serenaded
the advent of our infant earth, when,
wrapped in swaddling clothes of light,
it lay in the arms of the great Jehovah.
He saw the first fountain laid. He saw
the first light kindled. 'That hand which
was afterward crushed upon the cross
was thrust into chaos, .and it brought
out one world and swung it in that or­
bit, and brought out another world and
swung it in another orbit, and brought
out all the worlds and swung them in
their particular .orbits. They came like
sheep at the call of .a shepherd. They
knew his voice, and he called them all
by their names. Oh, it is interesting
thought to me to know that Christ had
something to do with the .creation. I
see now why it was so easy for him to
change water into wine. He first cre­
ated tho water. I see now why it was
so ea3y for him to cure the maniac. Ho
first created the intellect. I see now
why it was so easy for him to hush the
tempest. He sank Oennesaret. I seo
now why it was so easy for him to
swing fish into Simon's net. He made
the fish. I see now why it was so
easy for him to give sight to the
blind man. He created the optic
.nerve. I see now why it was o
.easy for him to raise Lazarus from the
dead. He created the body of Lazarus
and the rock that shut him in. Some
.suppose that Christ came a stranger to
Bethlehem. Oh, no. He created the
shepherds, and tho flocks they watched,
and -the hills on which they pastured,
and the heavens that overarched their
heads, .and the angels that chanted the
chorus on that Christmas night. That
hand .which was afterward nailed to
the cross, was an omnipotent and cre­
ative hand and the whole universe was
poised on tke tip of one of his fingers.
Before the world was Christ was. All
he world came trooping up out of the
fcarkness, .and 3je greeted them, as a fa­
ther greets his children, with a ""good
corning, ""or a -""good night."" Hail,
Lord Jesu3, morning star of the first
creation.
Again, Christ heralds the dawn of
comfort in a Christian seal. Sometimes
we come to passes in lite where all
kinds of tribulations meet us. You are
bniliing up gome gret enterprise, Yon

have built the foundation the wall
you are just about to put on the cap­
stone, when everything is demolished.
You have a harp all strung for sweetest
accord, and some great agony crushes
it. There is a little voice hushed in
the household. Blue eye closed. Color
dashed out of the check. The foot still.
Instead of the quick feet in the hall, the
heavy tread of those who march to the
grave. Oh, what are people to do amid
all these sorrows? Some sit down and
mourn. Some bite their lip until the
blood comes. Some wring their pale
hands. Some fall on their faces. Some
lie on their backs helpless and look up
into what seems to them an unpitying
heaven. Some pull their hair down over
their eyes and look through with a
fiend's glare. Some, with both hands,
press their hot brain and want to die
and cry,""0 God, O God!"" Long night,
bitter night, stupendous night of the
world's suffering! Some know not which
way to turn. But not so tho Christian
man. He looks up toward the heavens.
Ho sees a bright appearance m the heav­
ens. Can it be only a flashing meteor?
Can it be only a falling star? Can it be
only a delusion? Nay, nay. The longer
ho looks tho more distinct it becomes,
until after awhile he cries out, ""A star
a morning star, a star of comfort, a
star of grace, a star of peace, the star of
the Redeemer!"" Peace for all trouble.
Balm for all wounds. Life for all dead.
Now Jesus, the great heart healer,
comes into our home. Peace! Peace
that passeth all understanding. We
look up through our tears. We aro com­
forted. It is the morning star of the
Redeemer. ""Who broke off that flow­
er?"" said one servant in the garden to
another. ""Who broke off that flower?""
And the other servant said, ""The mas­
ter."" Nothing more was said, for if the
master had not a right to break off a
flower to wear over his heart or to set
in tho vase in the mansion, who has a
right to touch the flower? And when
Christ comes down into our garden to
gather lilies, shall we fight him back?
Shall we talk as though he had no right
to come? If any one in all tho universe
has a right to that which is beautiful
in our homes, then our master has, and
he will take it, and he will wear it over
his heart, or he will set it in tho vase of
the palace eternal ""The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away; blessed
be the name of the Lord."" Peace, trou­
bled soul! I put the balm on your
wounded heart tonight. Tho morning
star, the morning star of the Redeemer.
Again, Christ heralds the dawn of
millennial glory. It is night in China,
night in India, night in Siberia, night
for the vast majority of the world's
population. But it seems to me there
are some intimations cf the morning.
All Spain is to be brought under the
influence of tho gospel. What is that
light I seo breaking over the top of the
Pyrenees? The morning! Yea, all Italy
shall receive the gospel. She shall have
her schools and her colleges and her
churches. Her vast population shall
surrender themselves to Christ. What
is that light I see breaking over the top
of the Alps? The morning. All India
shall come to God. Her idols shall be
cast down. Her juggernauts shall bo
broken. Her temples cf iniquity shall
be demolished. What is that light I
see breaking over the top of tho Hima­
layas? The morning. The empurpled
clouds shall gild tho path of tho con

quering day

:he Hottentot will come

out of his mud hovel to look at the
dawn; the Chinaman will come up on
the granite cliffs, the Norwegian will
get up on the rocks, and all the beach
of heaven will be crowded with celes­
tial inhabitants come out to see the sun
rise over the ocean of the world's
agony. Th:y shall come from the east,
and from tJie west, from the north, and
from the south, and sit down in the

I kingdom cf God. These sweltered un

der tropical suns. These shivered un­
der Icelandic temperature. These pluck­
ed the vineyards in Italy. These pack­
ed the teaboxs in China. These were
aborigines lifting up their dusky face3
in the dawn. And the wind shall waft
it, and every mountain shall become a
transfiguration, and the sea will become
the walking idace of him who trod the
wave cliffs of stormy Tiberias, and tho
song of joy shall rise toward heaven,
and the great sky will become a sound­
ing board which shall strike back the
shout of salvation to the earth until it
rebounds again to the throne of the Al­
mighty, and the morning star of Chris­
tian hope will become the full sunburst
of millennial glory.
Again, Christ heralds the dawn of
heaven upon every Christian's dying
pillow. I suppose yon have noticed
that the characteristics ""of people in
their healthy days are very apt to be
their charcteristics in their dying days.
The dying words of ambitious Napoleon
were, ""Head of the army."" The dying
words of poetic Lord Byron were, ""I
must sleep now."" The dying words of
affectionate Lord Nelson were, ""Kiss
me, Hardy."" The dying words of Vol­
taire were, as he saw one whom he sup­
posed to be Jesus in the room, ""Crush
that wretch."" But I have noticed that
the dying words of Christians always
mean peace. Generally the pain is all
gone, and there is great quietude
through the room. As one of these
brothers told me of his mother in the
last moment: ""She looked up and said,
pointing to some supernatural being
that seemed to be in the room, 'Look
at that bright form. Why, they have
come for me now.' ""
The lattice is turned so that the light
is very pleasant. It is peace all around.
You ask yourself: ""Why, can this be a
dying room? It is so different from
anything I ever expected."" And you
walk the floor, and you look out of the
window, and you come back and look
at your watch, and you look at the face
of the patient again, and there is no
change, except that the- face is becom­
ing more, radiant, more illuminated.
The wave of death seems coming up
higher and higher, until it has touched
the ankle, then it comes on up until it
touches the knee, and then it comes on
up until it reaches the girdle, arid then
it oomes on up until it reaches the lip,

and the soul is about to be floated away
into glory, and you roll back tho pa­
tient's sleeve, and you put your finger
or. tire pulse, and it is getting weaker
and weaker, and the pulse stops, and
you hardly know whether the life has
gone or not. Indeed, you cannot tell
when she goes away, she goes away so
calmly. Perhaps it is 4 o'clock in the
morning, and you have the bed wheel­
ed around to the window, and the dy­
ing ore looks out into the night sky,
and she sees something that attracts her
attention, and you wonder what it is.
Why, it is a star. It is a star that
out of its silver rim is pouring a super­
natural light into that dying experi­
ence. And you say, 4 ' SVhat is it that
you are looking at?"" She says, ""It is
a star. "" You say, "" Wh star is it that
seems so well to pigase you?"" ""Oh,""
she says, ""that is the morning star
Jesus!"" I would like to have my death
bed under that evangelistic star I
would like to have my cyo on that star,
so I could be assured of the morning.
Then the dash of the surf of the sea of
death would only be the billowing up
of the promise, ""When thou passest
through the waters, I will be with thee,
and the rivers, they shall not overflow
thee."" All other lights will fail the
light that falls from the scroll of fame,
the light that flashes from the gem in
the beautiful apparel, the light that
flames from the burning lamps of a
banquet but this light bums on and
burns on. Paul kept his eye on that
morning star, until he could say: ""I
am now ready to be offered, and the
time of my departure is at hand. I have
fought tho good fight. I have finished
my course. I have kept the faith.""
Edward Payson kept his eye on that
star until he could say, ""The breezes of
heaven fan me."" Dr. Goodwin kept
his eye on that evangelistic star until
he could say, ""I am swallowed up in
God."" John Tennant kept his eye on
that evangelistic star until he could
say, ""Welcome, sweet Lord Jesus
welcome, eternity."" No other star ever
pointed a mariner into so safe a harbor.
No other star ever sunk its silvered an­
chor into tho waters. No other star
ever pierced such accumulated cloud,

or beckoned with such a holy luster.
With lanterns and torches and a

miles and see no sunlight. It is a stu­
pendous place. Some places the roof of
the cavo a hundred feet high. Tho grot­
toes filled with weird echoes, cascades
falling from invisible height to invisible
depth. Stalagmites rising up from the
floor of the cave stalactites descending

mighty's sculpturing. There are rosettes
of amethyst in halls of gypsum. As

Col. Robert Ingersol may be
unsound theologically, but his po­
litical expressions are worthy of
careful attention. On one oc­
casion, while making a speech a
man in the crowd yelled out:
'What's the matter with the dem­
ocratic party?"" Ingersol dropped
his line of argument, turned
towards his interrogator and re­
plied as follows:
""What is the matter of the
democratic party? I will tell. you,
my friend. Ihe democratic party
was born under the planets that
were in opposition. It lives in the
objective case. Like a mule, 'it
has no pride of its ancestry; no
hope of posterity.' It never origi­
nates anything. It shines by bor­
rowed light. It has never been
united in honest wedlock to a prin­
ciple, but lived, for years in open
adultery with a harlot called slav­
ery; lived with her until she died
of corruption and was buried amid
the sobs and groans of her para
mour.
""The atmosphere that surrounds
democracy is full of noxious vapors
that breed moral pestilence and
death. The sun never shines
through it; vice seeks its shadow,
corruption grows lustily under its
influence. Springs of purity are
never found in democracy. Its
waters are torpid, lifeless covered
with scum with which stagnant
pools and moveless waters always
offend the eye of man. The soil
which democracy has cultivated
has failed to yield harvests of val­
ue to the nation, but has given
crops of worthless weeds and
briars.
""Democracy has no love of
country; believes in states instead
ot a nation; drives loyalty from
its doors and welcomes in treason
to its habitation; holds the deeds
of our . soldiers and sailors as
naught; strives to blacken the
names of our heroes; weeps over
the lost cause; hates the blue and
loves the gray; stabs loyalty in the
back; binds up the wounds of
treason, and speaks words of hope
and comfort to its devotees; ap
plauds when helpless blacks are
stricken down in the south, and
caresses the hands red with inno
cent blood; denies the right of
American citizens to make homes
for themselves in the south; justi
fies the man who shoots them
down or drives them out.
""Democracy is a curse to the
land, the source of our bitterest
woes; the haven where vice finds
friends and crime its apologists
anddefenders. Democracy is orig­
inal sin let loose to rend and
destroy; is the spirit of evil filling
the swine of the land; the incar
nation of uuhohness; the child of
the devil; its home should be in
that outer darkness where there is
weeping and wailing and gnashing
of teeth. Such, faintly pictured
my friend, is what is the matter
with the democratic party.""

After reading the following letters can any
one longer doubt that a trustworthy remedy
for that terribly fatal malady, consumption,
has at last been found? If these letters had
been written by your best known and most
esteemed neighbors they could be no more
worthy of your confidence than they now
are, coming, as they do, from well known,
intelligent and trustworthy citizens, who,
in their several neighborhoods, enjoy the
fullest confidence and respect of all who
know them.
C. McLin, Esq of Kempsville, Princess
Anne Co., Va., whose portrait heads this
article, writes ""When I commenced tak­
ing Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery I
was very low with a cough and at times
spit up much blood. I was not able to do
the least work, but most of the time was in
bed. I was all run-down, very weak, my
head was dizzy and I was extremely despon­
dent. The first bottle I took did not seem
to do me much good, but I had faith in it
and continued using it until I had taken
fifteen bottles and now I do not look nor
feel like the same man I was one year ago.
People are astonished and say, 'well, last
year this time I would not have thought
that you would be living now.' I can thank­
fully say I am entirely cured of a disease
which, but for your wonderful 'Discovery'
would have resulted in my death.""
Even when the predisposition to consump­
tion is inherited, it may be cured, as verified
by the following from a most truthful and
much respected Canadian lady, Mrs. Thomas
Vansickhn, of Brighton, On She writes:
I have long felt it my duty to acknowledge
to you what Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery and his 'Pleasant Pellets' have
done for me. They almost raised me from
the grave. I had three brothers and one
sister die of consumption and I was
speedily following after them. I had severe
cough, pain, copious expectoration and other
alarming symptoms and my friends all
thought I had but a few months to live. A
that tune I was persuaded to try the 'Golden
Medical .Discovery' and the first bottle
acted like magic. Of course, I continued on
with tiie medicine and as a result I gained
rapidly in strength. My friends were aston-

In the earliest times of purchase a woman
was bartered for useful goods or for serv­
ices rendered to her father. In this latter
way Jacob purchased Rachel and her sister
Leah. This was a Beena marriage where
a man , as In Genesis , leaves his father and
his mother and cleaves unto his wife , and
they become ono flesh or kin the woman's.
The price for a bride In British Columbia
and Vancouver Island varies from 20 to 40
worth of articles. In Oregon an Indian gives
for her horses , blankets or buffalo robes ;
In California shell money or horses ; In Af­
rica cattle , A poor Damara will sell a
daughter for a cow ; a richer Kaffir expects
from three to thirty. With the Banyal If
nothing be given her family claim her chil
dren. In Uganda , where no marriage re­
cently existed , she may be obtained for
half a dozen needles , or a coat , or a pair of
shoos.Atfordinary price Is a box of per­
cussion caps. . In other parts a goat or a
couple of buckskins will buy a girl. PassIng -
Ing to Asia wo find her price Is sometimes
5 to 50 roubles , or at others a cartload of
wood or hay. A princess may be purchased
for 3,000 roubles. In Tartary a woman can
bf > obtained for a few pounds of butter ,or
where a rich man gives twenty small oxen a
poor manmay succeed with a pig. In FIJI
her equivalent Is a whalo's tooth or a
musket. These , and similar prices else­
where , are eloquent testimony to the little
value a savage sets on his wife. Her
charms vanish with her girlhood. She is
usually married while a child and through
her cruel slavery and bitter life she often
becomes old and repulsive at 25.

which had been greatly aggravated by
the alkali water of the western country,
and when I had reached that stage
where I could frequently hold nothing
on my stomach, and would even throw
up water as soon as drank, I learned
from a Sioux Indian, who had been on a
visit to the Kickapoo tribe, of a wonder­
ful remedy called ""Sagwa."" I got
him to procure some for me. The effect
was remarkable. I tried to get more
from the Indian, but he would not let
me have more of his. He prized it so
much he would not give it up. I then
learned that Healy & Bigelow, of New
Haven. Conn., had an arrangement with
the Kickapoo tribe, and was putting
their remedies on the market. I sent
and got a bottle of the Kickapoo
Indian Sagwa, and found it to be the
raame&sthat 1 had procured from the
Sioux Indian. I got more, and after the
use of a few bottles, I was not only re­
lieved but entirely cured, and have
stayed cured ever since.

I can eat anything set before me.
Salt bacon, which used to have a most
distressing effeet I can now eat and
relish like an Indian.

I cannot speak too highly of the Kick­
apoo remedies, and cheerfully recom­
mend them to anyone.

Mrs. Alex. Robertson, of Half Rock, Mer­

suffered with womb disease and most of the
time I was in constant pain which rendered
life a great burden, I cannot express what
I suffered. I had eight doctors and all the
medicine I had from them failed—the on*
after the other.

I was nervous, cold hands and feet, palpita­
tion, headache, backache, constipation, leu­
corrhea and no appetite, with bearing down
pains. 1 got so weak I could not walk
around. I nad to keep my bed, thinking I
would never get any better.

One day my husband got one of your little
books ana read it to me. He said there was
nothing doing me any good. I said I would
try Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. I did
try it. After the first few wmbs my appo­
tite was better I was ablo to sit up in bed.
I wrote to the World's Dispensary Medical
Association, at Buffalo, N. Y., and described
my case they sent me a book on woman's
diseases. I read carefully and followed the
directions as near as I could and took the
medicine for two years. With the blessing

SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER.
The doctor said: “She must go out
And take some exercise;
You must not let her mope about
As she does in this wise.""
In vain I coaxed and begged and plead.
Cajoled her and abused;
""I feel too tired."" was all she said;
And still she sat and mused.
And then I had a brilliant thought.
And seized at once upon it;
That day a stunning dress I bought,
Also a cunning bonnet.
And now she goeth forth arrayed
In all her panoply
To sco If there Is wife or maid
Who is well dressed as she.
Her health and color have returned—
Her Interest in life;
But. to this ilay. I've not discern'd
Who't fooled /, or my wife.’

A MIXER’S LUCK-PENNY
The Romance of a Daughter of
the Australian Mines.
11*72.
It is Saturday night on an Austra­
lian gold field. The bar of the ""Jolly
Diggers” is crowded.
News has gone abroad that “Dog”
Kellarey has broken out again, and as
he always takes care to have his little
bouts remembered a crowd soon col­
lects.
On this particular Saturday he has
set himself to try conclusions with
“Kangaroo Jack” of the Midas claim.
It is a gorgeous struggle—even old
“Wall-Eyed Hill,” who is exacting in
such matters, is compelled to admit
that. They fight anyhow and every­
where. under tables and under chairs
—while the lamps flare, the dogs bark
and the crowd expresses its admira­
tion in language full of picturesque
detail.
“Kangaroo Jack” tires after the
twenty-sixth round, an*i his friends
carry him to his tent minus one eye
and plus concussion of the brain.
Then, when “Dog” Kellarey counts
his broken fingers, everyone suddenly
remembers the unguarded state of his
tent and vanishes intt the darkness,
not to reappear until the sound of the
coach horn is heard on Portugee hill.
The arrival of the weekly coach,
bearing her majesty's mails, is an oc­
casion of great importance, and ranks
even before new finds or Warden's de­
cisions.

About eleven o clock the coach
creaks and groans up the street, to
pull up before the flaming1 lights of
the “Jolly Diggers."" It is a curious,
lumbering old construction, riding on
leather springs and drawn by five
strong horses—a sort of badly brought*
up cross between an antique mourn­
ing coach and a dilapidated Indian
gliari.
The driver, to whom is intrusted
the lives and hereafters of the half­
dozen passengers, travels the two hun­
dred and forty miles between the gold
fields and civilization twice weekly,
and is always preternaturnlly thirsty.
Custom, however, forbids his leaving
the box before he has seen his horses
unharnessed anti led away and ex­
changed the usual pleasantries with
his own particular admirers. When in
due time he does descend, passengers,
diggers, loafers and dogs escort him
into the hotel and in half an hour the
excitement is over.
On this occasion, however, it is des­
tined to last longer: “Dog"" Kellarey,
advancing, invites the driver to take
refreshment.
After complying with the request,
that individual gets out to the vehicle,
to return with a bundle. Then, unwrap­
ping the shawls, he places on the table
a baby girl. She cannot be more than
two years old. and is fast asleep, her
little head and its pretty curls pillowed
on one tiny arm.

Every one presses round to iook,
with the exception of •'Dog’” Kellarey,
who has no curiosity in the matter of
babies. Then questions pour in thick
and fast: “Whose is it?” “Where'd
ye get the kiddy, matey?” “Whose
youngster is it, Hill?’ etc.
Any other man would be bewildered
—not so Hill Hums. He says slowly
and solemnly, as if aware of his unique
importance: “For 'Dog' Kellarey!
“What!” shouts that gentleman,
“that’s a lie. you Hill! Who says the
kid’s for me?”
“I do!” replies the driver. “Poll
Wkites of Wild Dog shoved it aboard,
aloud with its duds, for yer. The little
'un’s father pegged out on Saturday
•Flash Dick’ of Wild Dog creek. ’Is
last words was: ‘Sen’ the kid to my
old mate ""Dog"" Kellarey;’ an’ so I
fetched it along, and the passengers
made up the fare among’em, so there's
nothin' to pa)'—there!""
-Old Dick pegged out!” the “Dog”
mumbles slowly—""old Dick pegged out
an' sent ‘is kid to ifir!
The crowd is so tickled with the idea
that it ventures upon a laugh.
’fJij laugh decides him, and, stepping

up alongside the sleeping child, he
sings out: “The kid’s mine, an’ the
inan as laughs agin’ 'er laughs agin’
me. Now let's see 'im as is game to
grin!”
He has evidently gone home, for no
one answers.
Sunday morning, and “Dog” Kell­
arey’s claim is the center of attraction.
The little arrival of the previous
night plays about his tent door. The
“Dog,” fearing harm to her from his
crowd of visitors, carefully defines his
boundary, and threatens dire penal­
ties on the head of any man who
crosses it.
News, news’. — great and glorious
news!
News which runs like wildfire
through tiie Field, which flies from
tent to tent—from the police cell on
the hill to Dutch Joe’s across the flat,
past the Eureka, down to the Day­
dawn—never stopping until everyone
has heard it.

** ‘Dog' kellarey’s proverbial bad
luck has turned at last—be has bot­
tomed on the Lead, the new claim has
turned up trumps with a vengeance.”
It is full of gold—specks, specimens
and nuggets. Not nuggets as small as
peas, but large as teacups. Not here
and there, but in a big deep lead, a for­
tune at every drive of the pick.
The Luck-penny, who has been sleep­
ing in the shadow of the tent, watches
and chuckles at a piece of glittering
mica. In his excitement the “Dog”
sings out:
“Hoys! 'tis 'er 'as done it; there’s the
lass that brought me luck!”
Three p. m. More excitement!
A nugget weighing fifty pounds.
The monster of the Field, a wonder of
the country, and a fortune to its tinder.
l’ioks and shovels are thrown down,
the roar of cradles and sluice-boxes
stops as if by magic, and the excited
crowd starts at a run for the claim.
On their arrival “Dog"" Kellarey says
nothing, but for the second time lie
carefully points out his boundary. He
places his revolver on the cradle, ready
to his hand, and. bless you! the crowd
understands what he means by that.
The Luck-penny sucks her thumb
and crows contentedly; womanlike,
she knows she is the center of attrac­
tion.
When the last visitor has departed
the “Dog"" picks her up, and says, em­
phatically:
“Kinchin! It's you as brought the
luck to the old man Now, look here,
three parts of that claim belongs to
you. it does!”
And he meant it.
1 892.
A bright, fresh morning, with a few
white clouds scattered about the heav­
ens, the better to enhance the blueness
of the sky beyond. A happy spring
breeze dashing round corners, and
playing the very mischief with silk
hats and dainty skirts, whistling
through telegraph wires, and covering
the harbor with a coating of continu­
ous white foam. A morning on which
to feel thankful for existence.
It is easily seen that something un­
usual is affecting the inhabitants of
Potts Point, that fashionable suburb
of luxurious Sydney.
At St. Mary's church door I find a
large crowd assembled, representing
all ranks of society, and, for the first
time, obtained some dim idea of the |
event I am about to witness. In order
to make doubly sure 1 question an
ancient lady, whose dress suggests
connection with some charitable insti­
tution.
At first she seems inclined to treat
ray thirst for information with con­
tempt, but finally a desire for gossip
overcomes her reticence, and she con­
descends to tell me all in one breath
that “This 'ere is to be the weddin’ o’
Miss Athelwood; not but that er name
ain't Athelwood, but Kellarey. ’Er as ,

bein’ that bad, she would curse, only j
she wouldn't. And Miss O’Sullivan, as
lives in No. 9, said as ’ow Miss Athel­
wood was worth well-nigh 'alf million
of money if she was worth a penny—
not but that she shouldn’t be, seein’ as
’ow she had been born on the gold dig- j
gin's, and every one knowed them was ■
good times. And a prettier and better
lady never stepped, beggin’ 'er pardon
for say in’ so.”

The old woman, once started, was |
hard to stop Hut I was interested in
Miss Athelwood, so ventured an in­
quiry as to her parentage.
**Ali! well may yer say that: not but
what yer mightn't understand, seein’
as ow ye're a stranger in these parts.
The poor young dear never ad no fa­
ther to know but Mr. Athelwood, the
lawyer. 1 'eard tell she were just
fetched up from them gold fields by a
feller called ICellarey—a miner chap,
who give her to Mr. Athelwood along
of a fortune which e said was 'ers.

That's twenty year or more now—the
same year as my good man was took
by the perlice fer the Orange bush­
rangin' ease, an' 'im not never so much
as 'avin' a 'alfpenny of the money,
but—""
I stopped the dear old lady's family
history by asking whom Miss Athel­
wood was about to marry. As I put
the question an old and villainously
dirty swaginan placed his roll of
blankets down at the church door and
pushed his way toward us.
“In l>eggin’ yer pardon,” my lady
went on, “Miss Atlielwood’s a-goin’ to
marry, as it’s not in my mind to re­
member—a dook or a hearl, but I can't
say which on ’em. Haide-de-camp to
the governor, they do say 'e is. But
look! look, ""ere they comes!”
Carriage after carriage rolled up to
the church door and set down its load
of fashionables. Then, amidst contin­
uous cheering, Mr. and Miss Athel­
wood arrived. She looked surprising­
ly beautiful, and I noticed that the old
swaginan was so overcome with as­
tonishment that he kept his eyes star­
ing at the door long after she had
passed through it and we had rushed
into tlie church to see the ceremony.
My whole attention was devoted to
watching the bride. 1 could not drive
her romance out of my head. She went
up the aisle a homeless girl, the prod­
uct of a gold field, ami returned to
the music of Mendelssohn's “Wedding
March,"" a countess and a member of
one of the oldest families in Europe.
After all the carriages had rolled
away and 1 was turning to go the old
swagman touched my arm, saying:
“Mister! I'm a-goin’ to get yer to do
me a favor!”

Asking mm wnat it was. he replied:
‘""Let's go somewhere out of this,
where we're alone, an’ I'll tell j’er!""
When we had adjourned to a more
fitting place raj’ companion spoke.
‘""I guess you’d call me a liar if I told
you that I was the man as brought up
that girl as we've just see married?
But I am—I'm ‘Dog' Kellarey, sure
enough, 'im as give 'er into Lawyer
Athelwood's 'amis twenty years ago.
with 'er share of the mine that panned
out so rich.’’
* ""Why don't you go to her. then? I
hear she's been hunting high and low
for you!”
“That’s just It: I know she has. But
d'yer think I’m a-goin' into the com­
pany o' the likes o’ 'er friends? Not
me! I’d be makin* u fool o’ the girl,
and she'd be ashamed o' ’erself. No!
I've tramped close on four hundred
miles to see her married, and now I’m
a-goin’ back into the bush to-night for
good. I want you to write this 'ere in
a letter for me—it ain’t much. Say:
‘From “Dog” Kellarey to ’is Luck­
penny on 'er weddin’ day,’ and put in
the corner, ‘I ain't forgot yer, mind!”’

Odd Isnt It where the heart is concern­

kind are found among the old girls and

gressive sort is confined mostly to those
who have been in society a half dozen

The antique is the kind which has for
its password one life one love The eph­

gressive is one with which we have to
I deal in answering the query Where are

I is most natural that the matured

marks a tree that will shelter her Her
time also Is a consideration She can­
not waste years dallying with an old

These perennials are many of them
good souls nice for escorts but not up
to date enough for Ideal husbands So
the marriageable women those who can
preside with dignity over neat homes
j the belles in short of past seasons
leave the ranks and form new ties
When a young lady becomes indiffer­
ent to parties likes distant friends pro­
tracted visits and cant be located keep

tices The outoftown men secure most
of the home prizes The only chance for
home bachelors is to emulate the exam­
ple of the girls that Is go out of town
too where they are not known as ever
lastings
Suppose however that they cannot
give up the old favorites suppose that
there is a great tugging at the heart
when they think of losing them In such
cases If the men value their happiness
and wish to wager on their chances they
must become specialists in love and ply
their skill increasingly as the summer
season approaches Goodbye sweet­

one more quickly than by the young lady

“I don’t see as this butter we get

than cow’s butter,” said Mrs. Van­
cover, one morning at the breakfast
table.
“What!” ejaculated Mr. Vancover,
excitedly.
“I say I don’t think the creamatory
butter is a bit better than any other.”
“My dear,” replied Mr. Vancover,
trying to calm himself, “do you know
what a crematory is?”
“No; not unless it is where they
make oleomargarine.""
“Well, my love, I will inform you.
A crematory is a place where dead
bodies—""
“O, gracious!”
“A place where dead bodies are
burned to ashes, and the ashes carried

DEBS ON THE STAND.
A. B, U. Leader Telle Hia Story
of the Qrut Strike.
Says the Courts Saved the Rail­
roads from Defeat
Commissioners Call Upon Pullman
to Appear and Taitlfjt
(Dy Associated Press )
CHICAGO, Aug. 20. The Strike Com­
missioners have notified George M.
Pullman to appear and testify,
and will alHo call for several
niemberH of the General Manage' As­
sociation. The dute for Mr. Pullman's
testimony of President E. V. Debs, ot
Is expected that he will appear Tues­
day or Wednesday.
By far the largest audience yet In
attendance upon the Strike Commission
sessions was present to-day to hear tho
testimony of President S. V. Debs, of
the American Railway Union. When
told to tell his story. In his own way,
what he knew of the Pullman strike and
Its results, the tall leader of the great
strike began In a low, clear voloe a
recital which gradually became more
earnest and forcible as he proceeded,
until It developed Into almost an ora­
tion. He told ot having received word
that a strike Iti Pullman was Imminent,
and of his coming to Chicago to Inves­
tigate.""I found,"" he said, ""that the men were
working for the Pullmon Company at
wages upon which they could not live.
I found that salaries had been cut time
and again until skilled mechanics were
working their lives away for wages not
sufficient for a common laborer; that
the town of I'ullman, with Its shops.
Its houses and Its store was so schemed
that every penny the worklngroan made
found Its way back Into the Company's
coffers.
""In fact, I found the worklngmen of
Pullman In a pltlble condition, and de­
termined to do all In my power aa
President of the American Railway
Union, to Improve their condition. The

strike followed, ordered by the men
themselves. Then came the boycott, or­
dered by duly elected delegates to our
Convention, and then followed the rail­
road strikes, ordered by the various
local unions,' each of whom had griev­
ances of its own.
Mr. Debs then told of the strike, his
account differing but little trom that of
the other AmerieanTlallway Union offi­
cials who had preceded him on thewit-nees-stanil
Hivsaid the I'ullman strike
was the prime cause of the railroad
strike, but that the railroad men had
grievances of their own. The General
Managers' Association had been organ­
nixed with the avowed Intention of giv­
ing assistance to railroads In labor
troubles. The evident aim was to drive
organised labor from existence.
No sooner had this Association been
formed than a systematic reduction of
railroad wages all over the country be­
gan. The cuts were made on one road
at a time and In one department at a
time, but the systematic regularity with
which they appeared was sufficiently sig­
nificant. The men were ready to strike,
and felt they had cause. But the trou­
ble would not have come when it did
had It not been for the Pullman matter.
""The time was unpropltlous,"" said Mr.
Debs. ""Business was depressed and
money waa scarce. I did not order the
strikes. I had not the power. The men
did that themselves. But I do not wish
to shirk any responsibility, and am will­
ing to say that I heartily concurred In
and approved of the action taken by the
men. As to violence, I always con­
demned It. I have written and spoken
against It, believing and knowing that a
strike cannot be won by violence. As to
telegrams sent from our' office counsel­
ling violence, I know nothing of any
such epistles.""
""What about the 'buy a gun' tele­
gramT"" asked Commissioner Reman.
""That la easily expl lined. The tele­
gram was sent by a private secretary to
a friend in Butte, and was merely a
playful expression. It was sent as such
uhd was so understood.""
Mr. Debs then said that within live
das after the strike was declared the
Union had the railroads beaten.
""They were paralysed,"" he aald, ""but
Just at that time Injunctions were sown
broadcast, and shortly afterwards the
officials of the American Railway Union
were arrested for contempt of court.
That beat us. It .was not the railroads,
or the army, but the power of the United
States Courts that beat us. About that
time a tblng occurred which I desire to
mention. Gen. Miles came to Chicago,
called on the General Managers' Asso­
ciation, and the next day was quoted In
an Interview- aa saying that he had
broken the backbone ot the strike.
""Now, I consider that call of Gen.
Miles is vulgarly out of place. He had
no more right to consult with the Gen­
eral Managers' Association than he had
to consult with the men of our Union.
I might say, too, that It seems strange
that all of our lettters and telegrams
were made public property, while not a
line of the railroads' correspondence was
published ""
Mr. Debs said that the union had taken
every possible means to prevent rioting
and disorder ""We objected to the pres­
ence of the Federal troops, but nut to
State troop and police If I remember
rightly no serious outbreak occurred un­
til the Federal troops arrived, as their
presence Inflamed the men.""
The witness then told of the trouble
with the railroad brotherhoods.
""The brotherhoods have outlived their

EXODUS FROM WASHINGTON.
President Oleval&nd Is on His Way
to Gray Gables,
Grtsham Will Fish and Morton Will
Go to Europe.
(Rr Associated Tress.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. M.-Presldent
Cleveland left Washington via the Penn­
sylvania llaltroad at 7.W o'clock this
morning for New York on his way to
Gray Gables. His companions on the
trip were Secretary Lamont, who goes
to Join his family ut Hay View, I I.;
Private Secretary Thurber, who Is bound
for Marlon, Mass., where his family are
summering, und a gentleman whose face
was not familiar to the railroad officials.
The party arrived at the station a few
minutes nfter 7 o'clock and proceeded
at onco to tho private car of President
Ttoberls, which was attached to the reg­
ular New York train. The President
took a seat on the rear platform of the
car. and with other members of the
party spent the fifteen minutes before
the train pulled out In watching the ar­
rival of other early travellers. There
was a good-stzed crowd In the station
when the President arrived there, most
of whom were Pythian encampment vis­
itors waiting for the trains to go home.
Few knew that the President .was ex­
pected, and fewer still recognized him
as he passed through. ,
Nearly all the members of the Cabinet
are preparing to take advantage of the
adjournment of Congress to secure va­
cations. Secretary Herbert is away
already, making a tour of insepectlon of
the Government navy-yards and stations
along the North Atlantic coast. All that
prevents Secretary Gresham from ur­
ranglug to temporntlly put aside the
business ot the Stute Department Is,
that there are n few troublesome for­
eign questions demanding his presence
heie for a while at least. He wilt
Mturtly, however, take a vacation which
will be spent in part In tithing.
Attorney-General Olney will spend his
vacation in and abojt Iloston. He has
decided that it Is too lute In the Heaeon
to open ills Summer residence at Fair
mouth, Mas and so with Mrs. olney,
who Is now In Peterboiogli, N. H he
will remain quietly at his Poston home
durlrg the thre or four weeks he ex­
pects to be absent from Washington.
He hopes to be uble to leave here to-duy
or to-morrow.
Secretary Carlisle has made no ar­
rangements for a vacation, und It Is ex­
pected that the administration of the
new Tariff act may keep him here for
some time yet.
Becretury Smith will spend ten days
or a fortnight In Oeorglu. He has Just
returned from u short vacation at Ocean
City, Mil., und will leave again early
next week, prnbablv Monday evening,
for his State. He will visit at both At­
lanta and Athens, where his family re­
turned last Monday. Georgia Demo­
crats expect him to make several
speeches while at Atlanta.
Postmaster-General Ulssell disposed of
a good deal of current business to-day,
and leaves to-night or to-morrow for
Huffalo, to which place Mrs. BIssell
returns from Keunebunkport, Me. He
will spend ull of his vacation In New
York State, and expects to resume his
duties ut the Post-Office DepHrtment
during the tlrst week of October. Dur­
ing most of his ubsence First Asslstunt
Jones will be ActingPostmaster-General.
Secretary Morton, of the Agricultural
Department, will spend his vacation In
Kurope. He has planned to leave In
the middle of September, and his itin­
erary includes n visit to Germany. Eng­
land and France. Ho will he accom­
panied by hl eldest son, and will be
away five or six weeks. Dr. Dabney,
the Assistant Secretary, will be the
Acting Secretary during Mr. Morton's
absence.

BRIDGE PLAN REPORT.
Commission Says aOantilovoraud
Rivor Pier Is Practicable,
But Thinks a Suspension Structure
Mora Desirable.
Plan Submitted for a 3,100-Koot
Span to Cost $80,743,000.
(Br Aiaoclattd Praia )
WASHINGTON. Aug. 31 -The War
Department to-day furnished a synopsis
of the report of the commission ap­
pointed to Investigate and recommend
what length of span, not less that 2,000
feet, would be safe and practicable for
a tallroad bridge over the Hudson Itlver
between New York and Jersey City, It
Is as follows:
The Commission finds that a 1,000-foot
span cantilever bridge, with a pier In
tho centre of the rher, would be safe
and practicable, and that Its cost, In­
cluding viaduct, would be !26,73,000, the
cost of the centre pier being estimated
at 19,710.000.
The depth to rock foundation within
the limits of the bridge location Is 260
feet, nearly 100 feet deeper than any ex­
isting foundation.
A 3,100-foot clear span cantilever from
shore to shore Is found to be possible
but Impracticable on account of Its ex­
pense, (61,128,000.

The Hoard reports that Investigation
satisfies It that a six-track, 3-100-foot,
single span suspension bridge would be
safe and practicable, and would, If cer­
tain constructions were adopted, cost
S36,3b7.r71. fciuch a bridge would carry
six maximum freight trains moving side
by side at full speed.
A plan is worked out and submitted
for a lighter structure suspension bridge,
which the Hoard believes would meet
every possible demand with absolute
snfety, at a cost of 330.743.000
The Board says It ""feels that the con­
contingency attending the construction of
the deep river foundations of the canti­
lever bridge Is enough to balance a part
of the greater coat of the suspension
bridge.'
The report Is Ignored by all the mem­
bers of the Commission, Major C. W.
Raymond, of the United States Kn­
glneer Corqs, O. Dousecaren, C.E.: Prof,
wm. II. Hurr. of Columbia College;
Theodore Cooper, C. C, and George 8.
Morrison, C. K.
Charles H Swan, Secretary of tho New
York and New Jersey Bridge Company,
who returned from Waohlngton last
night, when shown the report of the
Hoard of Engineers on the span lengths,
said to on ""Uvenlng World"" reporter:
""The report Is very Hotlsfactory to the
New York Company. It eliminates on
the score of two great expenses, over
lol ,000,004, the suspension plan Of the
Hoard of Trade's engineer.
""What my Company desires to build Is
a bridge, that Is a rigid structure oved
which six trains can pass at a time at a
speed not less than thirty miles an hour,
to be constructed nt a cost within a limit
where capital can get fnlr Interest.
""There is Just ro much money to he
earned bv the bildge, and one built with­
in a certain cost can pay such Interest.
If the bridge costs more we must either
reduce our expected rate of Interest of S
fer cent., and then we can't get capital
nterested, or else raise our bridge traffic
charges
""The latter we cannot do, for passen­
gers would not submit to an extrava­
gant toll. Therefore, If we build the
bridge It must be within our capital
limit, and we can only do so with a
cantilever plan, ns referred to In the
above repo-t.""
""I trust Secretary Lamont before de­
riding will allow us. as we requested, to
lay before him further details of our
plans, Shoud Secretary I.amont Indorse
our plan, we shall at once proceed to
organise a syndicate to raise the con­
struction capital.
""In all probability our construction
contractors could rommenee actual work
this Kail, but I doubt If ground will be
broken before next Spring.""

TOWING RATE WAR.
Illtal Hudson Hirer Companies Ac
uppt Itntnona I'rlcea,
(Br AnoclaU4 Praia)
ALBANY, N. Y., Aug. 31. The great­
est -ate war which has ever been known
In the towing business Is now In progress
on the Hudson.
When the Cornell Company purchased
the Beverwyck Company's boats It was
said that them would be no reduction In
rates, but, neertheless, a great cut has
been made hy the Honan and Cornell
lines which may, If continued, wreck one
of the companies.
The 11I1I charge for toning a loaded
ranal-boot from Albany to New York
was 123, but now it Is but IS Twele dol­
lars was the old rhargc for towing a
light canul-boat from New York to AI­
.bani. the cut rate Is to. The rate for a
loaded boat from New York to Albany
was tlK. but now Ih 110
The Itonan and Cornell companies hae
""scalpers"" all along the river to catch
trade. If runalers are not satisfied with
the low rates, each Company will offer
""special"" rates rather than let the rlal
Company get the business.
Both companies ure losing money dally,
but It Is a light to the finish, and H
looks as If the fate of one of the two
rompanles will be decided.

BESTTIME TO QUEENSTOWN.
' '
Camnania Mado tho Trip in 5 Days,
10 Hours and 47 Minutes.
Average Speed of 21.50 Knots Has
Only Been Heat en by Lucanla.
i (Ur AaaocUua PreiU
LONDON, Aug. 21 -The Cunard line
steamer Campania, Capt. Halns, which
silled from New York Aug. 25, arrived
at Queenstown to-day, bringing with her
another new transatlantic record of
speed. She passed Daunt's Itock at
6 34 A. M., having made the pussuge to
that point In G davs, 10 hours and 47
minutes.
Heretofore the eastward record has
been t das, 12 houis and 7 minutes,
made In November, 1893, by the Cam­
pania.The passage Just ended to-day there­
fore reduces th time by 1 hour and 20
minutes
The Campania experienced dense fog
on the banks lor nine hours, and was
forced to run at a greatly reduced speed.
It Is calculated that not less than sixty
miles were lost, owing to these unfavor­
able conditions.
According to her log, the steamer's
run was up to noon, Aug. 26, 405 knots,
and dally thereafter 513, 454, Gil, UX and
363 knots to Daunt's Itock.
The average tpeed attained was 21.50
knots, which has only twice been beaten,
on both occasions hy the Lucanla, when
In March, of this year she covered 21.74
knots, and In June of this year, when
the aveiage was 21.69.

On Friday, Aug. 17, the Campania
arrived from Queenstown, making the
voyage In 5 dajs, 9 hours and 29 minutes,
bteaklng all records.
Up to that date her sister ship, the
Lucanla, had held the record, but the
Campania reduced the time 2 hours and
38 minutes.

NEARLY BEAT NORMANNIA.
Her Slater Ship, Knent Bismarck,
Makes n I'nut Trip. f
The Hamburg-American liner Fucrst
Bismarck, Capt. Albers, arrived last
night from Hamburg and Southampton,
after a remarkable fast portiage of six
days, ten hours and fifty-two minutes,
only seven minutes behind the tecord
of her sister ship, Normannla.
The Bismarck, owing to dense fog,
which set In oft Fire Island,
and laated up to her arrival at Sandy
Hook, was obliged to run engines at re­
duced speed, otherwise she would have
broken the Normannla's record by sev­
eral minutes.
The following are the day's runs: 428,
487. 490, 482, 501, 49J and 168 to the Sandy
Hook Lightship, a total distance of 3,048
knots, at an average speed of IB 68 knots
Fine weather was experienced, with
prevailing westerly winds, until she
struck the dense fig on the Banks and
between Fire Island and Sandy Hook,
where she anchored at 8.45 last night.
She had 525 cabin passengers and car­
ried 252 In the steerage.
Oswald Ottendorfer. of the Stmats­
eltung. was one of the passengers. He
h greatly Improved In health and
spirits.
Among the other passengers were
Charlei. Livingstone Acker, Thomas T.
M. S. Byrne, Charles J, P. Balrd, Judge
W. Jackson, Prof, August Nlehaus, Wm.
Rhlnelander Stewart and Mrs. Stewart,
Bishop Walker, of North Dakota, and
Dr. Charles Albert Walker.

DIDN'T SEND PITCH PIECES.
Colombian Government Buss the
Tailors Who Hade Uniforme.
8,000 Yards of Cloth Alleged to Be
Remaining from 4,100 Suits.
Gerald Depallo, Vice-Consul of the Re­
public ot Colombia, In this city, brought
the members of the firm of Weiss &
Klau Brothers, tailors, at 201 Canal
street. Into th Tombs Police Court this
morning.
Mr. Depallo was represented by
Stephen C. Baldwin, of 29 Broadway,
w ho told Justice Ryan that about a year
apo a contract was made with the Smith
Manufacturing Company to make 4.100
uniforms for the Colombian regular
army. The Government was to furnish
five anl three-quarter yards of material
for ench uniform.
Ileforo the work was commenced by
the Smith Company a mini named Silver
went to work foi Weiss Ai Klauw
The unlfoims Wero made and shipped,
hut tho Consul now claims that the
agreement was that all piece left over
shou'd he shipped wlih the goods, to be
used for repairing.
A rew weeks ago Silver was discharged
by Weiss & Klau. nnd Informed the Con­
sul that the makers ot the uniforms had
by n cutting machine saved 3,000 yards
or material, which had not been sent on
with the clothing.
Alfred B. Jaworower, who represented
Weiss & Klau, said that the case was a
civil one. and that the action of Silver
was prompted by spite. He was willing,
he said. In ease a civil action was
brought, to deposit money to the value
of tho material, should Lawyer Baldwin
desire It.
Mr. Baldwin said he should, and asked
that the case gp to the Court of Com­
mon Pleas. This waa satisfactory to
counsel, and Justice It) an dismissed the
case.

whose hue is tho effect produced by looking
at the light through a delicate leaf. Jewelers
say that the peridot Ib a species of olivine, of
tho samo class as Jhe beryl, aqua-marine, and
topaz; and that it is, in fact, tho ancient ""to­
pazlon,"" otherwise known as chrysolite. It
is found In Egypt, Ceylon, and Brazil, good
crystals being exceedingly rare. Of its vari­
ous shades of green-olive, leaf, pistachio, or
leek, the clear lenf green is the most admired.
Of all the precious stones the peridot is the
most difficult to polish. The final touch is
given on a copper wheel moistened with sul­
phuric acid, a process which requires the
greatest care, for, if dipped into the acid tho
stone has tho peculiarity of becoming soluble.
Sometimes it is cut into rose form, or liko a
carbuncle, but it is better and more valuable
when worked in small steps, as tho brilliance
is thus increased.
Owing to the quality of softness the peridot
has been considered of llttlo valuo, but now

charged for the stono. It Is well for tho pos­

at $163,441,000, while the chickens
themselves were worth $142,644,350.

An old newspaper published at Bos­
ton, has a notice of the marriage of
Captain Thomas Baxter, of Quincy, and
Miss Whitman, of Bridgewater, on Dec.

courtship of forty-eight years, which
both sustained with uncommon forti­

Citizens of Centertown, Ky., who
were disgusted by the demoralizing
success two Mormon missionaries were
having among the women of that city,
made a coup de tar, so to speak, add­

the score or more converts they had
niade.

The South contains over 200,000,000
acres^of forest land—over one-half of
the woodland area of the United States.
She has almost every variety, so far
as quality is concerned. There are
nearly 6,000 sawmills in operation, em­
ploying over 78,000 hands. The output
of the planing mills in 1890 was over
$22,000,000.

The president of Hayti gave his war
secretary a thorough thrashing the oth­
er day, and almost without any prelim­
inary remarks. This sort of impromptu
scrapping may do in statesmanship, but
the Talleyrands of the prize ring would
not descend to it before spending three
months in an effort to talk each other
to death.

The death of Baron Mundy, the phil­
anthrophist, of Vienna, has caused
great sorrow to Mme Sarah Bern­
hardt, who considered him one of her
best friends. She never failed to visit
Mundy when in or near Vienna, and
declared that he was one of the noblest
men who ever lived. The baron spent
$20,000 in caring for wounded French­
men in 1870-71.

M. Y. Chung is the diplomat of the
Chinese legation in Washington, whose
thorough knowledge of English makes
him the medium of communication be­
tween the legation and the press and
public. Mr. Chung is a Yale graduate
and a member of the Delta Kappa Up­
silon fraternity. He is one of the first
of the Chinese officials able to speak
English without a trace of foreign ac­
cent.

The attorney general of Jamaica, Con­
stantine Burke, is colored, and there
are four distinguished men of color in
the legislative council. George Stiebel,
a negro, has been knighted, by the queen
for his services in promoting the suc­
cess of the Jamaica exhibition. There
are colored representatives in the judi­
cial and administrative departments of
the government and it is only a ques­

ment of the colony will be in their
hands.

On account of the striking changes
which the great lava lake in Kilauea
has undergone this year appears in the
Hawaiian Gazette. The lava steadily
rose after the last great breakdown
of the floor of the crater in March,
1891, when an area of 2,500 feet long
by 2,000 feet wide fell more than ,500
feet'in one night. Toward the end of
last year the rising and overflowing
of the lake filled the pit thus produced.
Since that time the activity of the lake

!, has been intense, as igany as twenty­
& three overflows of liquid lava having

1,

taken place in a single day, and the
walls surrounding the lake have been

rapidly raised by continued overflows.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88076432/1894-11-15/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,ndhi_europium_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Courier Democrat.,Koehmstedt & McLean,"Langdon, N.D.","","",380,2029,3518,23665,2,18413,27079,3,ndhi_europium_ver01/data/sn88076432/00271740700/1894111501/0327.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Langdon%2C_North_Dakota,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/ndhi_europium_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn88076432%2F00271740700%2F1894111501%2F0327.jp2/pct:2.063759,7.492891,19.106066,87.392444/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/ndhi_europium_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn88076432%2F00271740700%2F1894111501%2F0327.jp2/pct:2.063759,7.492891,19.106066,87.392444/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

That the physical and mental and moral
qualities are inheritable is patent to any

through the generations, and what is more
perceptible in such families may be seen on
a smaller scale in all families. A thousand

FADLEYTS CHRIS .MAS GIFTS. '

BY FRANK B. WELCH.

Young Mr. Fadley was in a worry.
He had some Christmas presents to
buy, and what to get was what wor­
ried him. First and foremast, there
was Miss Damon, upon whom he was
anxious to create an impression—she
must have something appropriate and
elegant, whether anybody else got
anything or not. Then there was his
bosom friend and constant companion
Harvey, a good fellow who had placed
him under obligation times without
number— he could ' not forget.
This being the case, Fadley started out
to rummage the stores.
He overhauled all the leading shops
in town, and by Christmas Eve had col­
lected what he thought was a pretty
sensible lot of presents for an amateur
Santa Claus to get together. For the
lady of his choice he had a handsome
toilet outfit of combs, brushes, powder
puffs and boxes, manicure implements,
hand mirrors, and no end of other ele­
gant articles for feminine use. These
were all inclosed in an elaborately be­
plushed and inlaid case which was
neatly wrapped and all ready to be
sent to the intended recipient. For
his friend -Harvey he had an elegant
shaving set, consisting of razors,
brushes, cups, hones, etc., done up in a
substantial case which was also ready
to be dispatched to the home of his
friend.
Not daring to trust a messenger with
tbe presents for fear of some mistake
Fadley started out himself to deliver
them. First he called at Harvey's
house, timing his call so as not to catch
his friend at home. With his friend's
mother he intrusted the package, she
promising that it should not be tam­
pered with until Harvey should open

""JUST AS IF I WERE IN NEED OF A
SHAVE.""

it himself the next morning. Then he
called _t the abode of Miss Damon.
The ring was answered by a servant,
who said the young lady was out doing
her Christmas shopping. Here was a
piece of good luck. Leaving the pack­
age with explicit instructions as to its
delivery Fadley said he would call,
Christmas night, as per previous ar­
rangement with the young lady.
There was a big job off his hands,
and Fadley mentally patted himself on
the back at having done it up so neatly.
He pictured to himself the glad sur­
prise of Miss Damon when she should
receive the substantial evidence of his
regard, and chuckled over the little
surprise in store for his dear friend
and chum, Harvey. Early Christmas
morning Miss Damon received her
package, upon opening which she ex­
claimed:
""Well, I never! Just as if I were in
need of a shave. Who ever has been
so kind as to furnish me with this ton­
sorial outfit Then her eye caught
the corner of a card sticking out of one
of the compartments of the case. This
she drew forth and read^
""From yours faithfully,
lr H. Ira Fadlet.""
""Oh!"" said the mischievous young
lady; ""Mr. Fadley, eh? Well, just
wait till he comes this evening. I'll
bawl 'Next' at him; see if I don't.""
Of all the mortified swains that ever
got into a pickle Fadley felt the worst
when the idol of his heart flashed the
shaving tools on him. He was utterly
speechless, until it occurred to him
that his friend Harvey had his dear
one's toilet set and one of the sweetest
of little notes that ever a lovesick fel­
low put together.
""Great snakes!"" thought Fadley; ""if
he reads that note I'll never hear the
last of it."" Then he explained the
mistake and begged off long enough to
hasten over to his friend's house to
exchange the packages. He found
Harvey at home, and as that amiable
young man jerked him into the hall he
simper inquired:
""Is my hat on straight, Ira dear, and
how do my bangs look?"" •
""Say!"" fiercely ejaculated Fadley, ""if
you don't shut your head I'll break it
for you!""

But there was no time to be lost, so
Fadley, after duly acknowledging that
the cigars were on him, gathered up
the toilet set and sped back with it to
the one for whom it was intended. 7
That was not""the last of the joke on
him, by any means. The thing leaked
out, as such things invariably do, and
poor Fadley was so annoyed by face­
tious allusions to his Santa Claus ex­
perience that he was compelled to
threaten with consequences dire any­
one who mentioned the subject.
An Absorbing Girl.
""There is no such person as Santa
Claus, is there?"" asked a small girl of
her mother. -
""Some folks say there is not,"" was
the reply. - ,
""Well, I don't care. I don't like folks
who say there isn't any Santa Claus.
They never give any nice presents.""

PROFIT IX APPLE TBSSS. ""
The Rural New Yorker quotes the
following : ""I approve of setting out
apple orchards, for I am persuaded
that the apple crop of the future is
going to be a profitable one, as the
population increases faster than the
applo trees, and many of the orchards
now standing are growing old and go­
ing into decay.""
POINTS OX FARM ACCOUNTS.
Says the National Dairyman: ""If
you would keep an account with your
elds, you would find out that you
can produce corn, oate, hay, or any­
thing cheaper on a well-manured field.
You would find that there are certain
expenses which are exactly the same
whether you Lave a good crop or a
poor one. These are : (1) Interest
on original cost of land, buildings
and fences ; (2) cost of seed, and to a
certain extent (3) cost of cultiva­
tion."" WINTERING PAPSNIT3.
The practice of leaving parsnips in
the ground through the winter is very
general, writes G. A. Woolson, of
Vermont, to the American Agricul­
turist. The prevalent idea that freez­
ing and thawing add materially to tho
flavor of the vegetable is erroneous,
as experience proves. The better way
is to dig them late in the fall and
store in a cool cellar. The advan­
tages to be gained by this process are
the early date at which they can bo
placed in the market and consequent
higher prices obtained, and the
length of time they retain their flavor
and freshness in spring and early sum­
mer. Parsnips thus cared for have
been kept into June with marked suc­
cess. Furthermore it avoids the neces­
sity of hustling around to dig tho
roots in the spring before tho tops
have made much growth ; likewise
worms and rot are unknown.
GLANDERS.
Glanders i3 a contagions malady,
which can bo communicated from one
animal to another by actual contact
only ; therefore, to prevent the disease
from spreading it is necessary only to
isolate all subjects which have been
exposed to the disease until the period
of incubation has expired. The period
of incubation, or, in other words, the
i time of receiving the contagion into
the system and the appearance of the
disease is usually in the acute form
five to ten days, while in the chronic
form it may be two or three months.
All exposed subjects should therefore
be quarantined for from 6ixty to
ninety days. There is no cure for
glanders. In the neighborhood where
the disease has prevailed due precau­
tion should be taken to guard against
the spread of the disease. All diseased
Bubjects should be promptly destroyed
and the carcasses should be burned.
All Buspected animals should be kept
isolated under veterinary supervision
until they can be pronounced sound
or destroyed. The stable where the
diseased subjects have been kept, as
well as all clothing, utensils, harness,
etc., should be thoroughly disinfected.

POULTRY DUST BATII.
Nearly if not quite all species of
fowls use the dust bath, says Albert F.
Firestine. They choose a spot of fine,
dry soil and scrape little holes, where
they pulverizo the dirt until iL is re­
duced to a fine dust. In this they roll
and shake their feathers and allow the
dust to penetrata to the skin. It ap­
pears that in some way this is doleter­
ious to the parasites which infest the
plumage or the skin. It has been
fiaid by some naturalists that as all in­
sects breathe not through the mouth
as warm-blooded animals do, but
through little openings in the skin
situated in rows along the side of the
body the particles of dust close these
openings, so that parasites die of
suffocation as quickly as a quadruped
would if held under water. This has
been denied by some scientists, who
Bay that these holes are defended by a
very delicate but effective apparatus
that makes it impossible for any foreign
matter to enter, no matter how minute
it may be. Be this as it may, I know
that wild birds take dust baths when­
ever the weather and the state of soil
permit. Nature is a good guide, and
whether the dust bath is for the pre­
vention and absorption of effete mat­
ter which has become too odorous, or
whether it acts as an insecticide, it is
certainly advantageous to fowls or they
would not use the dust bath. I say
that the careful poultry-keeper will
provide dust boxes for birds, filled
with fine duet, coal ashes, thoroughly
dried and mixed with insect power.
It makes but little difference which of
these varieties of soil you use ; the
principal part is to have it clean. That
is, not a highly manured eoil, but a
comparatively unfertile one is prefer­
able. The next qualification is that
it must bo perfectly dry. Western

FALL CALVES THE BEST TO RAISE.
There is no longer any use disput­
ing the extra value of fall calves for
raiding. And they constitute one of
the chief sources of profit to the but­
ter dairyman, who has his skim milk
and raises his own cows, finely bred. It
is no wonder that such wise men esti­
mate the value of skim milk at one
cent per quart. Aud they have learned
how to employ it to the best advan­
tage. ""I always feed it with bran,""
says one. But bran atone would not
do, although it is essential to rapid
growth because of its bone-producing
elements. A little flaxseed, properly
prepared, returns to the milk a part
of the fat removed by skimming, and
keeps the bowtls in order. Boil it in
six times its bulk of water f jr twenty
minutes, or until it makes a jelly.
Iwo tablespoonfuls of this jelly placed
in each gallon of milk fed the calves,
with a handful or two of bran, accord­
ing to the age of the calf, will make
large, eleek, choice animals. Too
much bran fed to very young calves
is not desirable. There is no com­
parison between fall calves carefully
reared in the barn ia this way for the
first six months, and spring calves
turned out to battle with flies inside
ui two months after birth. The evi­
dence is wholly in favor of the fall
salves. And it is surpriring how soon
they begin to eat hay. Give them the
best early cut. Many are beginning
to find a similar course satisfactory
for veal production, slightly increas­
ing the jelly with full rations of milk,
but not enough to cloy the appetite.
Some feed a little corn meal in con­
junction with the ration when fatten­
ing veal. This must be used judi

ciously not more than half a pint at
a meal to the oldest, biggest calves.
Such veal at this season and until veal
begins to be low in price will sell as
readily and for as much money as veal
fattened on expensive butter tats.
Look out for well-bred heifer calves.

FARM AND GARDEN NOTES.
Many farmers begin toiling withoat
proper preparations in advance.
Tight horse collars are apt top-o-duce
permanent swelling of the threat.
If any little pigs nre expected on
your farm be sure the sow has warm
quarters.
Use the sprinkler of kerosene at
least once a week an 1 keep the roosts
always saturated.
When fattening an animal puah from
the start gradually at first of course
and save time and feed.
Potash is the chief fertilizer to be
applied to fruit trees, particularly
after they come into bearing.
With proper management medium
weight hogs are the most profitable to
grow for the general market.
Over-feeding is a waste for indiges­
tion is the result and food that ia un­
digested, uuissimilated, is wasted.
If the young stock are not thrifty
when they go iu to winter, it is doubt­
ful if they will come out thrifty in
the spring.
The boys and girls of the farm
ought to be allowed a plot of ground
wherein they can iw something for
themselves.
Give your children good, sound, en­
tertaining and morally heathful read­
ing. Subscribe for tho best magazine
for your wife.
How are the cow stables? Full of
cracks or Avell battened? Winter is
here and you ought to have the stables
in shape now.
Laj ing hens will always give better
results when supplied with plenty of
sharp, gritty material with which to
grind their food.
Never allow a hog to eat or sleep in
the dirh It is naturally a clean ani­
mal, but it does not always have tho
opportunity to be so.
All animals eDjoy a clcau, dry bed
at night. Do you know of anything
better than good straw and plenty of
it to furnish such a bed?
It is a serious mistake to keep tho
teams in almost complete idleness un­
til spring opens, and then force them
suddenly into hard work.
To grow plants iu living rooms i3
not difficult. Success depends upon
choice of plants, and upon the care
and attention given them.
The New Jersey Experiment Station
says that grades, crosses and especially
natives, appear somewhat less subject
to tuberculosis than pure-bred cattle.
There is no money now in big, fat
pork. The market calls for lean
bacon. The weight of the carcass
should not exceed two hundred pounds.
This is the time of the year when
the milk yield is apt to decrease. Un­
less great caro is taken to milk out
every droxi this tendency will becoxo
more pronounced.
Look well to the young calves, that
they do not go into the winter stunted.
Two months' good care through tho
winter will put them ou grass next
spring in good shape.
Tho capacity for work of the horse
depends, in no small uegrce, upon the
condition of his shoulders ; hence by
preventing galls and sores he is able
to do the field work faster.
Apples may be kept in cold storage
for many months if perfect, unbruised
fruit is selected, carefully wrapped in
paper and kept at a temperature of
not over thirty-eight degrees.
The wise farmer looks into the
future. He does not do this because
he is unduly anxious, or because his
faith in farming is weak, but because
it is a precaution which his business
demands.
With present prices for wool and
mutton, as compared with the cost of
fodder, the keeping of old sheep can
not be made profitable. It is a good
time to dispose of all that aro getting
along in years.
Tho fall months aro importaut as
providing a time during which tho
food of tho stock may b9 gradually
changed from the succulent grasses of
summer to the dry, concentrated
foods of winter.
With a large flock of chicks, abun­
dance of milk, a good-sized patch of
strawberries and vegetable garden,
the health of the family may virtually
be assured and the provision dealer's
bill greatly reduced.
Th class who had common breeds
of cows ten years ago, and still haTe
thm, must eventually succumb to the
spiril of the times. They will be
forced to capitulate from necessity if
not from conviction.
The wide-awake dairyman who has
stocked his farm with the best of cows
and feeds them intelligently can pro­
duce milk much more cheaply than
his neighbor, who is still beating
along on the old track.
In pig-keeping the breed is not of
bo much impoitance a3 the type. The
kind wanted is one that will finish off
symmetrically at from six to eight
months old if pushed, as market feed­
ing in general should be, making good
weights without excessive fat.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn91068084/1894-12-07/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,ncu_elk_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Fisherman & farmer.,Fisherman & Farmer Pub.

will not be for want of superier cook­

Charter Oak Cooking range with all
equipmcnti needed in a well regulat­

""Let's see I promised you a gold

of roily. ""The place of all places in

acquitted himself of his promise and
then directed Polly's attention to the
superior stock of silverware carried
by th's .house. ""There is no other
such house in town"" said the old man,
'and.I will guarantee the quality to
to be the very best. Pick, out your

Mr. Patton carries a magnificent line.
'Don't forget another fact"" he con­
'inued, ""If ever you unfortunately
need optical goods, this is the place
to come. He has everything requir­
ed to improve affected eyes and to
determine the required treatment.""

Josh, as they reached the street, ""I
must run over to the Bank of Mary­

with Joe Burger, the cashier, and
his assistant, Tas. A. Goddard for of

You will find them ever ready to
extend any accomodations compati­

""Halt!"" commanded Uncle Josh as
the party came in front of George &
Montgomery's handsome drugstore.
""Walk right in."" Why, Uncle,
we'er not sick, and "" ''Guess I
know that, but I suspect it won't be

enough before leaving she was loaded
down with combs, brushes, face

imported perfumes, and a bountiful
supply of fancy stationary. ""Don't
forget'"" added Uncle Josh, ""to come
here, with your prescriptions ( as
George & Montgomery are competent
pharmacists and use pure and whole­
some drugs. You will find few
handsomer drug stores anywhere than
this.""
At this point Uncle Josh suggested
a resort to some place of refeshment.
At the refreshment table;athe old
man waxed philosophical. ""Never
neglect your larder,"" said he. ""That
important adjunct to house-keeping
controls'masculine temper. To that
end'you'must patronize a grocer on

It is extremely difficult to tell a lie.
Falsifying is as easy as to roll down a
greased plana But a sublime lie, in
which one hand touches the stars and
the other dives down through the eat^h
and comes out the other side, that re?
quires genius. I remember in my ybuth­
ful days having an immense respect for
George because he could not tell a lie. -
As Ladvanced I found that to do so he
would have required the brillianoy of
Hamilton, the astuteness of Robert Mor?
ris and the cleverness of Franklin?
which he did not have?.but was simply
the well shaped marble Washington we
know today.
The difficulty consists in the faot that
truth no longor confines herself to her
proper realm of probability. She takes
to herself such unlimitable bounds that.
tho most brazen cymbaled lie possible
to be conceived, dreamed or manufac?
tured has metaphorically,physically and
spiritually to take a back seat
I am led to these reflections by some
remarks of my friend, Captain Ebenezer
Luffhard. It seems truly Baid that the
world has changed so much that a man
can no longer tell a lie without its be?
ing detected as the truth. .
We wero speakiug of the launching of
ships.
""Do you know,"" said the captain,
""that down in the Caribbee islands peo?
ple build ships up on top of an old vol?
cano? Yes, sir, a thousan feet 'bove sea
leveL Yes, sir, Dutchmen. An they
launch 'em too.""
A smilo went around the circle which
made tho glasses jump on the table. It
was an incredulous smila
""But, by the 'tarnal eels, I've seen
'em. A lot of Dutchmen. Live In a cra?
ter. Thousan feet up. An so steep you
have to go up steps cut in the rock to get
to it An they build ships there in the
crater o' a volcano. An what's more,
not a stick of timber grows on the
blasted place.""
""Now, cap,"" ventured one of his
bearers. ""Fur be it from me to say a
geutl'mau an old skipper like meself
ain't confinin hisself to tho truth. An
I've ho'rd tell of folk 'long the bay of
Fundy buildin ships way off in the
woods noways nigh the water. But thar
tide rises 60 feet an launches them ships
as slick as though they was built in a
shipyard. But, dash my skin, if I ever
ho'rd of a tide risin a thousan feet How
do they launch them ere boats?""
""Lower 'em down the rocks clear into
deep water. I'm a son of a sea cook if I
haven't seen them Dutchmen lower 'em
down?thousan feet""
I chuckled over one of the captain's
best What was my disgust to subse?
quently find in ""Down the Islands,"" by
William Agnew Paton, page 29, that tho
name of this remarkable spot is Saba. a
small Dutch island rising out of the sea
in sheer walls of rock; that the inhab?
itants really live 1,000 feet up in the
air in tho crater of a extinct volcano.
Mr. Paton says in his very interesting
book:
? ? ""Tho people of SaSa are celebrated
oddest places imaginable for a shipyard.
When tho boats are ready to be launched,
they are lowered down the overhanging
precipices into the sea There is no tim?
ber growing on the island, no beaoh
from which to launch a boat when it is
built, no harbor to shelter one when
launched, and yet these Dutch West In?
dians profit by their trade of shipbuild?
ing aud cruise all about the Caribbean
archipelago in the stanch, seaworthy
craft they construct in the hollow of a
crater on the top of their mountain col?
ony.""
Alas, tho captain had but told us the
truth. Let us charitably conclude that
ho thought tho story so improbable that
it would answer as well as a lie.?Phil?

old gentleman said, loud enough for
her to hear: “Poor body! I hope she

Picture of • Bachelor.
Mr. Joseph Tipton was a baohelor of
exceedingly methodical habits. Prim
and neat in appearance, he never affect­
ed any new fashions, but always looked
exactly the same day after day—pepper
and salt colored trousers, with black
ontaway ooat No one had ever seen
him in a different attire. Not even when
he was supposed to be Indulging in a
holiday did be oondesoend to a more
comfortable looking costume. He was
so much the creature of routine that it
would have been no comfort to have
been in any other garments than those
he usually wore. He was short, his fig­
ure had a slight idea of developing into
rotundity, but evidently it was only a
half formed idea, for he remained com­
paratively thin. Ha had a mild, ordina­
ry looking face, which ha tried to make
severe by cultivating his rather thick
eyebrows well over bis eyes, but if you
took the trouble to look underneath them
and behind the gold rimmed glasses
you would have discovered that his eyes
were of dull grayish hue, the reverse
of what he desired to make them ap­
pear. Still the little irritable, narrow
j lines about tho mouth and chin prevent­
ed his face from wearing that benevo­
lent look which would have made chil­
dren know he was their friend. He was
just the man who held children and
dogs at arm’s length, which showed a
certain warp in the little man’s charac­
ter.—London Society.
The Writing of ""Ben-Hnr.""
General Lew Wallace in his lecture
1 on “Ben-Hur” recounts some facts in
connection with the writing of that fa­
-1 znoua novel. At the time he wrote the
1 story General Wallace had never visited
* the Holy Land, and nnder the circum­
stances his accurate piotures are little
1 short of marvelous. AU the information
he had was obtained from personal ac­
' qnaintauces who had traveled through
Palestine and from reading the writings
1■ of other authors. A large map was be­
fore him as be wrote, and he constantly
| had to draw on his Imagination, but in
this respect he was always fortunate
’ and never made a blunder in his descrip­
tions. In fact, the Palestine of “Ben-
Hor” is generally regarded as author! -
| tative, and General Wallace relates with
keen relish how a younger antbor wrote
| a story, the soene of which was laid in
the Holy Land, and stole all his descrip­
tions bodily from “Ben-Hur.” General
Wallaoe says that bis hardest task in
\ writing the book was to find a hero.
His favorite passage in the story is the
soene of Ben-Hur’s house, where he de­
-1 scribes the miracles of Christ. General
Wallaoe believes that more art is dis­
-1 played in this passage than even in the
| famous chariot race, which is generally
regarded as the strongest passage of the
1 book.

Kosebery No Better.
The condition of the health of Lord
Rosebery is not changed, but there is no
question that he is seriously ill and that
tue complications of the political situa­
tion are such as to deprive the premier
of the energy necessary to fight difficult
and delicate questions.
Under these circumstances it is not
astonishing that wild rumors are circu
lated, and that many people are turning
their thoughts toward Mr. Gladstone as
ikely to be the man who will guide the
Liberals once more out of political dark
ness and into the sun-ihine of harmony.
Mr. Gladstone is now on his way to Lon
don and is expected to arrive here to
night
Mr. Wylie Crawford, the well known
Paris correspondent of Truth, this 'week
has drawn a painful picture of Oueen
Victoria as she looked upon her arrival
at Nice.

A LIVING SHADOW.
REMARKABLE TRANSFORMA­
TION OF A NORTH CAROLINA
MAN.
Strange, but True, Story from the
Lumber Regions of a Southern
State—Verified by Personal
Investigation.
{From the Greenville, N. C., Reflector.)
The following interview has just been
given our reporter by Mr. G. A. Baker,
the overseer at the farm of Col, Isaac A.
Sugg, of Greenville, N. C. It will inter­
est anyone who has ever had typhoid fe­
ver, Mr. Baker said in part:
“I wras living in Beaufort County, and
on the 2d day of October, 1893, 1 was
stricken down with typhoid fever. I had
the best physicians to attend me, and on
the 15th day of January, 1894, I was al­
lowed to get up. 1 was emaciated, weak
and had no appetite. I could only drag
along for a short distance and would be
compelled to sit down and rest. This con­
tinued for some time and I began to give
up hope of ever getting well. I lost my
position in Beaufort County, and having
secured one in Pitt County, clerking in a
store, I undertook it, but was so weak I
could not do the work and had to give it
up. The disease settled in my knees, legs
and feet. I was taking first one kind of
medicine and then another, but nothing
did me any good. I was mighty low-spir­
ited. I moved out to Col. Sugg’s about
four or five months ago and commenced
taking Dr. Williams’ Pills. I took three
a day for about three months. I began to
regain my appetite in a week’s time, and
then my weakness began to disappear,
and hope sprung up with a blessedness
that is beyond all telling. At the expira­
tion of the three months I was entirely
cured and could take my ax and go in the
woods and do as good a day’s work as any
man. I was troubled with dyspepsia and
that has disappeared. It is also a splen­
did tonic for weak people. I say, Mr.
Editor, God bless Dr. Williams; may he
live for a long time. I know he will go
up yonder to reap his reward; for he has
done a wonderful lot of good. Tell every­
body that asks you about Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People that if they
will come to me I can certainly satisfy
them as to their merits. I always carry
a box of pills with me, and whenever I
feel bad I take one.”
We were forcibly struck with the earn­
estness of Mr. Baker, and his statements
may be relied on.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills contain, in a
condensed form, all the elements neces­
sary to give new life and richness to the
blood ami restore shattered nerves. They
are an unfailing specific for such diseases
as locomotor ataxia, partial paralysis, St.
Vitus’ dance, sciatica, neuralgia, rheu­
matism, nervous headache, the after ef­
fects of ia grippe, palpitation of the heart,
pale and sallow complexions, all forms of
weakness, either in male or female, and
all diseases resulting from vitiated hu­
mors in the blood. Pink Pills are sold by
all dealers, or will be sent postpaid on re­
ceipt of price (50 cents a box. or six boxes
for $2.50), by addressing Dr. Williams’
Medicine Cos.. Schenectady, N. Y.

An Extraordinary Freak.

A citizen of Tampa, Fla.. is the owner of
a wonderful curiosity in the shape of a pair
of deer's horns, in which one of the prongs
ends in a startling malformation. Four
inches fTom the place where it branches
from the main horn this prong suddenly
enlarges into a bulbous growth nearly as
large as a man's fist, and it is in this ex­
crescence that the wonder lies. The bulb is
in the form of a hound's head, plainly show­
ing ears, mouth, eyes, etc. It was ""taken
in the town."" and were it otherwise it is
impossible that it could be a work of art,
owing to the enlargement necessary for
the freak.—St. Louis Republic.

MIIS. COTTIER SKXTEMED.
Will De Imprlnoned for Not Trlllng
Where Her Child In.
CHICAGO, July 8.?Mrs. Lizzie Cottier of
Washington was today sentenced to six
months In Jail for contempt of court in re­
fusing to disclose the whereabouts of her
daughter Florence. Mrs. Cottier is the
Washington stenographer who, in 1383, af­
ter placing her daughter In hiding, told the
Buffalo police that the child had been
drowned. Her husband. Alzerno Cottier,
who Is a wealthy Chicagoan, had attempted
during the hearing of the divorce case to
regain possession of the child, and Mrs.
Cottier was ordered by the court to tell
where her daughter is hidden. This she
repeatedly refusfed to do. her final and
emphatic refusal to obey the order result­
ing in her sentence today.
Mrs. Cottier was at once placed in charge
of a deputy sherilT. but was not imme­
diately tak^n to jail. Her lawyers asked
timex for preparation of arguments for an
appeal from the decision, and she was al­
lowed to remain in the court room during
the day, pending action on the question of
an appeal.
Mrs. Cottier declared that she could not,
no matter what the penalty, disclose her
daughter's whereabouts, as she believed
that the girl would be both morally and
financially injured should the father find
her.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1895-07-08/ed-1/seq-2,"","",2,"","",1,dlc_greyhound_ver02,"","","",true,ca,Evening star.,W.D.

Chicago, July 16. The field of the
Cloth of gold with all its significance
of chivalry was outrivalled in Chicago
today. In elaborateness of arrangement,
at least, and the celebrity of the com­
batants, the majority of the spectatois
present thia afternoon, were persuaded
rightly or wrongly, that the up-to-date
tournament equalled, if it did not sur­
pass the famous occasion when the
knightly champions of old had a joust
that challenged the attention of chrisien­
doin.Today's affair was strictly modern in
every detail, and if lacking in display of
tinsel and plumes, seemed all the great­
er to the witnesses, who took in all se­
riousness that it was a contest of intel­
lect instead of muscle. Certainly both
sides displayed an earnestness and vigor
worthy of an encounter that it was ap­
parent to them would attract the keenest
national and perhaps international inter­
est.No such ""big talk.""' has ever been
planned before, it is claimed, as this ten
days go-as-you-please match between the
chosen representatives of the opposing
ideas of the mouey question, Roswell G.
Horr and Win. II. Harvey.
It was about 2 p. in. when the witty
ex-Congressman from Michigan, now a
resident of New York, and the sharp
Colorado newspaper man, now a resident
of Chicago, signified to the judges and
the select audience present by invitation
at the Illinois club on Ashland avenue
that all was in readiness for the succes­
sive 1,000 word broadsides that, with
three minute rests, were to last three
hours a day for ten successive days. The
judges were ex-Solicitor General of the
Untied Stated Charles H. Aldrich and
Henry Miller.
MR. HORK'S STATE3IEXT.
Mr. Horr spoke first. He said:

""Judges and Gentlemen: It is
agreed between Mr. Harvey and myself
that previous to entering upon the gen­
eral discussion each of us shall make a
brief statement denning in a general
way the position he proposes to occupy
in this debate.
""The question which we are about to
discuss ia one that is not only receiving
very great attention among the people of
the United States, but it is one that is
also receiving some attention from the
nations of the old world. The question
iuvolves the kind of money that shall be
used by the people of the United States,
and has to do with laws which will affect
the great business interests of this na­
tion.""The question of finance is a very com­
plicated one, and there are some features
of it about which the ablest meu of the
world have been differing for years. The
foundation of the discussion upon which
we are about to enter is a small book
published by Mr. Harvey, and entitled
'Coin's Financial School. '
""The real main object of that book is
to convince the people of the United
States that this government alone should
mt once enter upon the free and unlim­
ited coinage of silver, upon the old ra­
tio of 16 to 1. The wisd .m of such a
course I dispute. Mr. Harvey will still
maintain the affirmative of that issue. I
will state in the outset that from the be­
ginning to the end of the book there ia
hardly a proposition made to which I
give my assent.
""I propose to controvert many things
which are stated as facts and shall at­
tempt to prove that the entire theorv set
forth by this author if adopted by the
people of this country would lead only to
business disaster and financial ruin. I
do not remember now ever to have exam
ined a book carefully in which I found
Bo few statements that I consider worthy
of belief, and I certainly never saw so
many absolute errors crammed into so
few pages.
""I am not here as an opponent of bi­
metallism. I believe in the use of gold
and silver as money to the fullest extent
that can be done on sound business
principles. My position upon this
question has been too frequently
stated within the last five years
to be misunderstood by any one. I be­
lieve that both gold and silver are the
natural money of the world; that in all
the larger transactions, gold is the better
adapted to the needs of the people than
silver; that all the smaller business
transactions of the human family for
many years have been and always should
be conducted with silver.
""I also believe that in all transactions
of the nations of the world between
themselves, the two metal3 should be
used in the settling of balances, bat
only at their commercial value. I also
believe that in the business of our
nation the people should never attempt
to use either metal except at its actual
value, only in cases where one metal may
be used as token money and be made re­
deemable in metal at its commercial
value.
""I have always entertained the hope
that the business men of the world would
yet come together in an international
convention and agree upon some basis
whereby gold and silver can both be used
bb the money of final settlement among
the people of the entire world. I am
very clear in my idea that until some
bucu arrangement snail do made, it
would be simply suicide for ""this
nation to adopt a system of the free
coinage of silver upon the old ratio a

He Had Been Camping
A well-dressed, middle-aged man sat at
a table in a Grant avenue rotisserie last
evening, industriously picking the bones
of a small bird. He held a leg in his lin­
gers, and after he had stripped the bone
carcessly tossed it off the table on the
floor. The other diners sitting near wire
properly shocked, and a sjrpriscd waiter
picked up the bone and carried it out.
The man seemed abstracted,and did not
observe that he had created a sensation
as he picked ihe other leg. He nibbled
iat it, surveyed it critically, and nibbled
it again till it was bare, and then tossed
it over his sboulder. It landed on the
plate of nn elderly gentleman who was
dining at the next table,
""What in thunder!"" he roared, and
two waiters hurried to remove the offend­
ing bone. ""Who did it"" he demanded in­
dignantly.
""This gentleman here, sir,"" whispered
the waiter, shaking his napkin toward)
tho man. who was calmly picking an­
other bone.

""Wha-wha-what is the matter?' he
stammered.
""Matter? What ao you mean by throw­
ing your old bones ovor hereon my table,

A WIDOW’S LOVE.
It was “steamer day” at Sitka, and
amid all the joyous stir and excitement
that the monthly boat brought was one
forlorn, unhappy man. Tom Douglas
watched his friends as they eagerly
opened their letters and listened with
assumed interest to the bits of news they
were anxious to share, for at Sitka the
population throngs to the wharf when
the steamer’s whistle is heard and waits
the coming of the ship and tho distribu­
tion of the mails. Tho people crowd in­
to the tiny postoffice on tho dock and
watch impatiently for the longed for
home letters.
But Tom’s home letter was not a
comfort to him. “Well, she is really
coming,” he thought, “a month from
today, if the steamer is on time. I will
be a married man ; worse luck. How
can I ever tell Natalia, dear little girl!
I wouldn’t willingly hurt her tender
feelings for $1,000,000, as hard up as I
am. ” And Tom whistled ruefully.
Tom Douglas was a naval officer and
before being stationed at Sitka lie had
been on duty a winter in Washington,
where he plunged into society with that
gay abandon that only a sailor knows,
for after three years at sea a young fel­
low is quite ready for the rash and
whirl of the gay capital. All houses
were open to the handsome lieutenant,
but there was one where he was espe­
cially welcome. The hostess was a pret­
ty widow of some 26 or 27 years of age.
Her husband, who had died soon after
their marriage, seemed not to have had
a very strong hold on her affections, for
after mourning him decorously for a
year she blossomed into the gayest of
the gay, and her house became a center
for the young officers who had been the
friends of her husband.
It was there that Tom spent most of
his time. Ho dropped in during the
morning and discussed the newest gos­
sip or the latest magazines and came in
for a cup of tea in the afternoon and re­
mained till her cozv parlor was empty
save for himself anc{ her.
,rAre you going to the assembly to­
night?” he would ask.
“Will yon be there, Tom?” Mrs. Deer­
ing had such a good fellowship way of
nsing her friends’ first names.
“ Yes, I presume so. ”
“Well, then, I am going,” the little
widow would reply.
And that was the way tho winter
passed, Tom running in at all hours,
privileged to smoke or read, to talk or
listen, the most indulged of all her
callers. When Ins orders came for his
immediate removal to Alaska, he put
the document in his pocket and went as
nsnal to the cheery home of Mrs. Deer­
injj. Hq fcojq her the news and was real­
ly surprised and flattered by Lef recep
tion of it. She took both his hands in
hers, and the tears gathered in her bright
eyes.
“Oh, Tom,” shosaid, “Ihate M> have
yon go.”
Now, it never occurred to Lieutenant
Douglas before, but at this moment the
idea did come to him that he Was in
love with the widow. Ho drew her to
him and kissed away her tears, And be­
fore he knew it he was engaged ft) Alice
Deering.
He left soon after arranging to have
Alice join him later in the summer, but
owing to the loss of a distant relative,
the heir of whose modest estate she was,
her coming had been great ly delayed. It
was now more than a year since Tom
and she had parted in Washington. In
the meantime Tom had whiled away his
leisure hours in the somewhat narrow
cirole of Sitka society, but in that nar­
row bound he had found a fair Russian
flower that ho know bloomed for him.
Though Tom had not made love to Na­
talia—he was too honorable for that—
they had been together constantly, and
each knew instinctively what was in the
other’s heart.
“I believe I’ll go and tell Natalia
all,” Tom continued to muse, “right
now, for of course as a gentleman and
officer I am bound to keep my word,
and my word is given to marry Alice—
hang it! I wish I had never been bom.
She, too, poor girl, may discover that my
love has somewhat cooled. If it ever

was love, it never was the same feeling
I have for dear little Natalia, bless her
loving heart. ”
So Tom went to Natalia and told her
that he was ougaged, and that another
month would see him married.
Her delicate face whitened, but con­
trolling herself she said:
""I congratulate you, Mr. Douglas.”
Then, bursting into tears, she turned
away. The sight of her tears was too
much for Tom. Embracing her tender­
ly, ho said: “I love but you, Natalia,
darling. Oh, that I had met you first!
My fondness for Alice was but a fleet­
ing thing, and my love for you will
last forever. ’ ’
Pressing warm kisses on her lips,
he held her close.
‘‘Leave me, Tom. It is right for you
to keep your word, but you should have
told me of your engagement before. We
Lad best part now. Goodby. ”
“But can’t I come to see you, Na­
talia, as usual?”
“Why, certainly not, Mr. Douglas.

.t would only be painful, for we can i
Bever, from this time forward, be any- I
| thing but the most formal of friends. ”
Tom was touched by the simple dig­
■ nity of the young Russian girl, wb<f.;e
I quiet life had beeu spent by the sea­
| shore under the shadow of the moun­
tains, far from the noise of city or
town, so he bowed to her will Their
j parting was a heartbreaking one to
! both.
j “Natalia, I can’t bear to leave you.
[ I must have you, dearest. ’ ’
“There, go now. This is only fool­
’ lsh.”
“Well, then, let me kiss yon for the
last time, darling,” pleaded Tom.
Natalia put tip her little tear stained
face, and Tom silently kissed her and

went away.
That month passed only too quickly
for poor Tom, who looked with dread
toward the coming of the steamer. He
Studiously avoided Natalia, denying
himself the regular afternoon walk to
the Indian river, which is the event of
the day to all the white people at Sitka.
He kept close to his rooms when not on
board ship, cursing the mistake of his
life which was so soon to make an un­
willing bridegroom of him.
To Natalia, whose soft, brown eyes
were red with weeping, life seemed a
dreary blank now that the daily visits
of Tom lmd ceased There appeared in
her mental horizon nothing for which to
live. She wondered how she had exist­
; ed before ho came to Sitka. But then
| she had beeu busy with her lessons, and
! nowT, in the idea of her old fashioned
j father, her simple education was com­
S plete, and it was time for her to marry
! one of the Russian lads who sought her
hand.
The next “steamer day” Tom Douglas
was seen rushing madly to Natalia's
home. The neighbors, who of course had
noted his long absence, were greatly sur­
prised.
“Natalia, Natalia,” he cried as soon
as she came into the quaint drawing
room to receive him. ""I’ve come to ask
you to be my wife. Dearest, say yes at
once. ’ ’
“Why, Toni, are yon crazy? What has
become of Alice?”
“Well, by George, Natalia, she is
married! Just think of it—married!
And I am the happiest man on earth.
A pardoned convict’s feelings of relief
are not to be compared to mine. You
see, soon after she left Washington she
met an old sweetheart whom sho had
cast off to many Mr. Deering, whose
position and prospects seemed better. In
the meantime this fellow had made a
fortune, and as he was on his way to
Alaska for a pleasure trip they decided
to make it also a wedding trip and break
the news to me in person. Rather awk­
ward, you might think, but I congratu­
lated them with all my heart and thank­
ed my stars for my freedom. Come, lit­
tle girl, put on your hat, and I’ll take
you down to the steamer to see the
bride, and I’ll introduce to her my
fiancee, because you say, ‘Yes,’ don’t
you, dear?”
!iI StnifSose so, Tom, but it’s all so
sudden. Shall I wear my leghorn hat?”

Scandinavian Wood Pulp.
The amount of wood pulp now pro­
duced in Scandinavia is reported to bo
enormous, and besides the many wood
pulp mills there are a large number of
native cellulose and sulphite works, the
former supplying more than one-half the
wood pulp production. Next to these
come the sulphite mills, the wood pulp
mills exporting barely half their pro­
duction, or considerably less in quantity
than the sulphite and cellulose. Almost
all fee papqr exported frqa gvedpn is
said to be made from wood pulp. A re­
cently published account of this industry
show a total of some 95 establishments,
and for 65 of those the aggregate power,
usually water, is reported to equal about
18,000 horsepower. The most important
of these are thus enumerated: Those of
Omon, Tralliatton, 2,460 horsepower,
with 24 horizontal and 2 vertical mills;
that of Munkidal, Uddevalia, 1,250
horsepower, -with 10 horizontal and 1
vertical mill, and Tossefors, Ottebal,900
horsepower, with 17 horizontal mills.
There are 12 patron cellulose works and
17 sulphite establishments.—New York
Sun.
What Makes Niagara Falls’ Power?
What makes Niagara falls’ power pos­
sible is the fact that Lake Superior,
Lake Michigan, Lake (luron and Lake
Erie, with a combined area of 90,000
square miles, representing the reservoirs
of some 250,000 square miles of water­
shed, are situated 000 feet above the sea
level. The great volume of water fall­
ing over the vast territory flows on its
natural course to the Atlantio ocean
with but a slight descent, until it is
brought into the narrow Niagara river,
when, in the rapids just above the falls,
it declines 55 feet and then, with a sin­
gle plunge, drops into the abyss, 165 feet
below. Eminent engineers have com­
puted that 275,000 cubic feet of water
pass over the falls every second, repre­
senting in theoretical energy over 6,000,­
000 horsepower.—Cassier’s Magazine.
Improving on Nature.
“Horrors!” exclaimed the beautiful
society woman. ' ‘ Do you mean to try to
soli me that picture as an artistic pres­
entation of a group of horses?”
Tho great artist paused a moment be­
wildered. Then a light broke in upon
him, and with a few rapid strokes he
painted out all the long, graceful tails
on the horses and substituted for each a
docked tuft that stuck out straight like
a pump handle.
“Ah,” said the society woman, clap­
ping her hands with pleasure, “now that
is a picture worth having. ’ ’—Chicago

Dh! Mother Toil, stepmother true and sweet,
L*ad in the narrow path, my wandering feet,
And though I miss the milder Joys of life.
Teach me to gird my heart for noble strife
While I was still a wayward, fretful child,
Uow didst thou lure me to thy bosom mild;
With what quaint qulbs and with what Jocund
ways
Thou didst beguile me in those far off days.
Holding a mask before thy solemn face.
And hiding years beneath a youthful grace
Now drop thy mask: I know thee as thou art,
3rave and severe, teaching tha harder part,
With worn and knotted hands, and weary eyes.
Vet thou alone canst teach where Heaven lies

A HOLIDAY TRAGEDY.
All my life I have been—well, not
exactly a woman hater, but a firm be­
liever in the idea that man is the lord
of creation, and that woman is not an
absolute necessity. For many years it
was my proud boast that I was able to
dispense with feminine aid and yet live
a very eujoya ble life, as, with clockwork
regularity, I went from my bachelor
lodgings to business each morning, re­
turning in the afternoon, and spend­
ing the evening at the club or some
place of amusement. The idea of hav­
ing a lady companion in my rambles
never entered my head.
True, my landlady (good old soul!)
prepared my meals and cleaned my
rooms, but that was because I had not
time to do it myself, and a man-serv­
ant was beyond iny means. But in all
else I dispensed with woman's aid.
Boot cleaning, sewing buttons on,
lighting the fire, etc., were all done
with my own hands—nay, at a pinch,
1 have even washed a pocket handker­
chief.

I desired to stand forth as a living
example of the original Adam, and a
proof of the superfluity of the modern
Eve. But my misguided companions
refused to profit by my teachings or to
follow my example. One by one they
fell under female influence, one by one
they married, and then—I cut them
dead. Ah, me! Those free Bohemian
days were happy ones, as year after
year I pursued my adopted course, in
spite of the continual falling off of
my comrades. Then came a time when
my circle of acquaintances had de­
creased so considerably that I began
to feel lonely. Bachelor chums were
more difficult to find than ever. To
loneliness succeeded melancholy, and
I grew miserable and pessimistic.
One friend, to whom I laid bare my
woes, said:
""You keep to yourself too much.
What you ought to do is to lodge with
some family where there are two or
three grown-up daughters. They
would wake you up a bit.*’
This, to me, the hitherto ideal ad­
vocate of an Eveless Eden! And yet,
after the advice had been tendered
several times, I began to think that
such a change might be beneficial.
Such a course need not involve the ren­
dering up of my tenets; but, as woman
still formed a part of the world, she
might at least contribute to my
amusement. So, after very serious
consideration, I decided to seek fresh
apartments, with light society thrown
in.
Now m3* troubles commenced. I
could not make the direct inquiry:
""Have you an3’ grown up daughters?”
80 I generally viewed the rooms, listen­
ing to the landlad3r's verbiage, settled
the rent, and then casual^' asked:
""Have 3’ou any children?*’ and the re­
ply would lie: ""Yes, ‘four,’ ‘five’ or
‘six’” (as the case might be); “the
eldest is ten 3’ears old and the young­
est two months. But they are as good
as gold, and never make a bit of
noise.”

The numberless journeys I made
and the many desultory conversations
I listened to were all to no purpose.
No one appeared to possess grown-up
daughters—the eldest was always ten.
Just when I was about to abandon my
search fortuue—or was it fate?—led
me to Myrtle Villa, Paradise Hardens,
Upper Dulwich. The door was opened
by a vision of loveliness, faultlessly
dressed, and with bright blue eyes
and golden hair. “Newly married,”
thought I. “Well, here at least, the
oldest won't be ten!"" She invited me
in and then disappeared; a middle­
aged lady entering directly after, we
proceeded to discuss terms. Then
came the inevitable inquiry as to chil­
dren.
“I have two grown-up daughters,
the younger of whom opened the door
to you.”
At last! Need I say that within a
we$k I was installed in Myrtle Villa?
The landlady (a widow) was a genial,
homely woman, and the youngest
daughter, Annie, aged twenty-five. I
have already described, but the other
daughter, Julia, did not impress me fa­
vorably. bbe was neither good looking

nor pleasing, and, without being ex­
actly bad-tempered, always insisted
upon having her own way.
I now seemed to be in a new world.
My boots bore a brilliant luster each
morning without my aid, and my slip­
pers were laid ready for me in the
evening, and, as for lending me a nee­
dle and cotton—the idea!—if 1 would
only leave them outside they would ^
only be too happy.
I no longer needed to seek relaxa­
tion at the club after the labors of the •
day. Julia played the piano well (her |
only accomplishment), while Annie I
sang divinely, and thus the evenings i
passed altogether too quickly. Male
acquaintances they did not seem to
possess—yet, stay, there was one—a
Mr. Malcolm, whose name I frequently
heard mentioned, but as his calls were
alwaj's made in the daj-time I never
saw him. 1 had rapidly passed into
that condition of mind which raised a
feeling of jealousy on his account, so
one day I questioned my landlady on
the subject.
“Oh, he’s a very old friend of ours.
Once we thought he would have pro­
posed to Julia, but nothing came of
it.”
What a relief! Only Julia!
So time went pleasantly on. and
then—how can I can confess it?—my
lifelong creed was thrown to the
winds, my proud ambition humbled in
the dust, and I became a willing slave
to the sex I had so long despised and
ignored. My only thought now was
how and in what words I should be­
seech my darling Annie to become my
wife. Time after time I was on the
point of speaking, but Julia always
turned up at the critical moment
One evening Julia announced that a
week thence she had an engagement
to play at a concert. Then burst upon i
me a brilliant inspiration. I pur- !
chased two stall tickets for the Ly­
ceum for that same evening; and,
making pretense that I had them
given to me, 1 persuaded Annie to
promise to accompany me. This time
Julia would not be able to intrude,
and I should know my fate. In two
months' time I should l>e taking my
summer holiday, which would tit in
jtus nicely for the honeymoon.
On the eventful day 1 hastened home­
ward with a queer fluttering in my
heart and a flower-spray for Annie in
my hat. Julia opened the door, and
hardly permitted me to enter before
she informed me that Annie had been
out in the hot sun and had been
obliged to go to bed with a very bad
sick headache. My fluttering heart
gave one huge bound and then seemed
to stand still. However, to disguise
my feelings I said:
“I am sorry; and you have to play at
the concert?”

“No,” she replied, “the concert has j
been postponed.”
“Then may I beg the pleasure of
your company? I did not ask you be­
fore because of the concert engage­
ment.”
“Thanks. I shall enjoy it immense­
ly”
What a miserable failure that even­
ing proved to be. I do not even know
what the play was called. I was think­
ingall the time of my poor sick darling,
and not of the acting or the woman
who sat by my side wearing the flower­
spray that was meant for Annie.
The words were still unspoken when
my holidays arrived, and tearing my­
self away from the two sisters, who
stood at the gate and waved their
handkerchiefs as long as I remained in
sight, it was with no feelings of joyful
anticipation that I betook myself to
Hastings for rest and recreation.
Rest! Where could I find it? Not
on the parade or pier, amid hundreds
of couples promenading, as I had pic­
tured Annie and myself doing; not on
the beach, where the Ethiopian musi­
cians were eternally playing “Annie
Laurie,” “Sweet Annie Rooney"" and
“Annie. Dear, I’m Called Away.”

For a whole week I wandered aim­
lessly hither and thither. Then I could
stand it no longer. So I wrote a long
letter commencing “Darling.” and
pouring out the impassioned, pent-up
love that comes but once in a man’s
lifetime. I besought and beseeehed
her to take pity upon me, or my life­
less body should surge in the billows
•hat beat relentlessly on ihe rocks of
.Beaehy Head.
When I had finished I happened to
catch sight of a photograph which I
had purchased the previous day, repre­
senting one of the .yachts preparing to
start on her morning trip, with my own
figure in a prominent position in the
bows.
“Ah!” thought I, ""I’ll send that to
Julia.”
If it were possible I had now less
rest than before, night or day, while
waiting for the answer. Rising in the
morning with haggard looks and burn- !
ing brow, the other boarders would i
remark that the sea air did not seem to
agree with me, while under the mask i

of assumed indifference there rag*
within me the fiercest volcano tha
ever burned in the heart of man.
At last the reply came, and bound­
ing up to the privacy of my own room
with trembling fingers 1 tore open the
envelope which hid from me—life or
death?
“Dearest, I am yours forever. I
cannot say your proposal was unex­
pected, for 1 have felt that you could
mean nothing less, ever since that
evening when you so openly expressed 1
your preference by taking me to the
theater—”
What! whew!! where!!! I looked at
the signature—“Julia.” Oh. heavens!
I saw it all. I had placed them in the i
wrong envelopes, and sent the letter
to Julia and the photograph to Annie!
How I raged and fumed and tore my
hair, until at last, in sheer exhaustion,
I sank into a chair and endeavored to
finish reading the letter.
“Annie thanks you very much for
the photo., and she desires me to tell
you that yesterday Mr. Malcolm pro­
posed to her and was accepted. We
will have the two weddings on the
same day. Won’t that be nice, dear?”
Nice? This was the last straw. Nice,
indeed, for me to be married to a wom­
an 1 did not care for, and at the same
time to see the one I loved given to
another man. I cannot remember what
I did for the next hour or two beyond
cursing my foolishness, and swearing I
wouldn’t marry Julia. Then, when I
became calmer, I saw an action for
breach of promise looming. I thought
of all my hard-earned savings of years
being swept away by a sympathetic
jury to heal Julia’s broken hgart.
There was no escape for me.
She had my letter which simply
commenced: “Darling,” and as no name
was mentioned in it from beginning to
end, was it possible that any body of
intelligent men could be brought to
believe that I intended it for Annie
when I addressed the envelope to
Julia? No, no. I must go through
with it—I would marry Julia. Yes,
and I would teach her that man ia
the lord of creation, and that woman
is but a helpmate but not an equal, and
so, in my married life, triumphantly
assert those principles which I had
held so long.

Julia married me at the same time
and place as Annie became Mrs. Mal­
colm. I now spend my evenings en­
deavoring to solve a difficult problem,
and that is—why do they call woman
the weaker sex?—Tit-liits.

THE LEGATION RETICENT
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 5.-Chinatown
Is in a turmoil aqd a boycott war is fiercely
waging. The Chinese Six Companies.
which for so many years have controlled
matters in the Chinese quarter, no longer
work in harmony and will probably never
again he united. The quarrel has spread
all over the couatry among Chinese, from
here to New York.
The trouble originated in the murder of
Chang Wai, a member of the Sam Yup
Company. Mok Tal, a Cay Zee Yup man,
was arrested for this murder, but his com­
pany believed him innocent and asked the
Sam Yups to call off the prosecution. This
they refused to do, and the Chinese con­
sul sided with the Sam Yups. Then a
boycott was declared against the Sam
Tups by the See Yups.
The Sam Yups comprise the wealthier
classes of Chinese, who do a big business
as hut-hers, while the See Yups are com­
posed of the laboring classes, mainly cus­
tomers of the Sam Yups. The See Yups
have started rival shops and a strict
boycott is being waged against the Sam
Yups, greatly to their discomfiture and
financial loss. Three of the companies
have sided with the See Yups, twi.
against the Sam Yups, but the fifth, the
Yeong Wo Company, composed of the bet­
ter class of merchants, hold aloof from tl1
tray.
They, too, are threatened with war if
they do not come over into the camp of the
enemies of the hated Sam Yups.
Jaw Men Sang, president of the Weong,
wio tried to be diplomatic and not become
invelved in the quarrel, has as a result lost
ids position and has been succeeded by
Bow Yee, a rival, from China. Bow Yee
is studying the situation, and it is believed
he is awaiting the arrival of instructons
from the Chinese minister at Washington.
The Chinesa consul here, generally a than
of great influence among his countrymen,
Is tow treated with contempt by all ex­
cept the Sam Yups, and he will probably
Icse his position if the wishes of the ma­
it-rity of the Chinese count for anything.
No matter what decision may be reached,
the Sam Yups are ruined, for enmities have
been engendered that cannot be removed
except by their financial ruin.

may eat what he likes and as much as he

people who are troubled with indigestion.
Particularly for those in whom it manifests
itself in the form of constipation. The
“Pellets” are quick and easy in their action.
They are in perfect harmony with Nature.
They effect a permanent cure. You need
take them regularly only a little while.
After that, use them occasionally when you

NO GOOSEBERRY PIE FOR HER.
The Old iAdy Had a Dinner That BaN
prised the l&owiag Gamblers.
Tho old lady entered a restaurant
which, rightly or wrongly, is known as
the resort of the gay and careless. She
was typically countrified in appearance,
her spectacles resting on the bridge of
her nose, her ""hat being old fashioned
and her gait and general attitude those
cf one fresh from the little farmhouse.
Without, however, any sign of halt­
ing confidence that was to be expected
of a stranger to city ways, she sat down
at the most conspicuous table in the
room. A surly looking short card play­
er, who, although it was 6 o'clock in
the afternoon, was just getting his break­
fast, stared at her with curiosity. Two
dejected turf gamblers, prevented from
attending the races on that day by bad
luck cn the day before, who were solac­
ing themselves with strong waters and
who hadn't spoken to each other for
half an hour, observed her with slight
smiles.
""Well, now,"" said one, ""that's a
funny old girl to see in here. I remem­
ber seeing her kind in country towns
when I was in the show business. I'll
gamble on what she'll order. She'll
have gooseberry pie and milk, and she '11
eat tho pie with her knife. They don't
have no forks where she comes from.""
But the other would not bet. He said
merely and not unkindly, ""She doesn't
seem to fit this place. ""
They could not hoar what she ordered,
but they could see that there was noth­
ing flippant in tho attitude of the wait­
er who went to her. She ate with delib­
eration and then departed. One of the
two unsuccessful patrons of the turf
called the waiter and asked, ""What did
that old lady order?""
""Why, le's see,"" answered the wait­
er, ""I think she had pigeon and a pint
of fizz. She's very fond of both.""
The gamblers looked surprised.
""Who is she?"" asked one.
''Why, don't you know her?"" queried
tho waiter. ""That's Mile. Lanconi, the
head dancer in this new burlesque at

It is said that tho saying, ""Much may
be deno with a Scotchman if ho be
caught young,"" which has passed into a
historical, witticism, Was first spoken by
Dr. Johnson in reference to Lord Mans
field. An amusing little incident is said
to have given rise to tho remark.
Lord Mansfield, having received his
education entirely in England, always
considered himself an Englishman, but
the fact that he was born in Scotland
was once referred to with great effeefc.
General Sabine, governor of Gibraltar
at tho time, having failed in his at­
tempts to oxtort money from a Jew
sent him back by force to Tetuan, in
Marocco, from whence he had como to
Gibraltar. The Jew afterward went to
England and sued the governor for
damages.
Lord Mansfield, -who was then known
as Mr. Murray, was counsel for the gov­
ernor. In tho courso of his defense be­
fore the jury ha said :
""True, the Jew was banished. But
where? Why, to the place of his na­
tivity ! Whero is tho cruelty, where the
hardship, where the injustice of banish­
ing a man to his cwu country?""
Mr. Kowell, counsel for the Jew, re­
torted: ""Since my learned friend thinks
so lightly of tho matter, I ask him to
suppose the case his own. Would he like
to bo banished to his native load?""
Tho court rang with peals of laugh­
ter, in which, Murray himself joined
with a right good will.- YoutshM Cora

Follows Bloodlessness and Nervous
Prostration.
From the Press, New York City.
For more than fifteen years Mrs. A. Mather, who
lives at No. 43 East 112th street, New Tork, was
a sufferer from anaemia, whieh, in spite of the
treatment of physicians, gradually developed into
nerous peettration until Inally marked symptoms
of peralysis set In. Mrs. Mather gladly gave the
reporter her experience.
""For many years,"" Mrs. Mather said, ""I was a
constant sufferer from nervousness. It was about
fifteen yesrs ago that my condition began to grow
worse. Soon I became. so affected that I was
prostrated and, until about two years ago, was a
part of the time unable to leave my bed. I em­
p ed- several physicians from time to time, my
I at the drug store for prescriptions some­
times meinting to as much as $50 a omonth, but
all the dotters did for me did not seem to help
me at all. My blood became greatly impoverished
and after years of suffering I was ""threatened
with paralysis.
""When I walked I could scarcely drag my feet
along and at times my knees Would give way so
that i would almost fall down. Feeling that doc­
tors could not help me I had little hope of recov­
ery, until one day I read In a newspaper how a
rson, afflicted almost the same as I was, had
n cured by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale
Peoiple. I purchased a box and began taking the
pills. The effect of this first box pleased me so
much that I bought another. Before I had .taken
all the pills In the first box I began to experience
relief, and, after the third box had been used, I
was practically cured. It was really surprising
what a speedy and pronounced effect the medicine
had upon ne.
'I always keep Dr. Williams' Pink Pills in the
house now, and when I feel any symptoms of nerv­
ousness And that they give me certain relief.""
Mben Mrs. Bather talked with the reporter she
was dressed for the street, intending to go out for
a walk. She locked the picture of health, far
different than she did before taking the Pink Pills.
Mrs. Mather's daughter corroborated her mother's
ac' ount, and told how she herself had been cured
of chronic indigestion by these pills, and, too, how
bet cousin had been cured of anaemia in same
way.

sent by Emperor Charles V., in 1541,
lost 140 vessels on tho rocks of Moroc­
co, 8,800 men losing their lives.
Of the fleet that sailed in 1502, under
Gen. Mcndoza, to deliver Oran from
the Mussulmans, twenty ships, includ­
ing the flagship, with tho above-named
general on board, never returned.
A year later, in the fall of 15G3, a
cyclono In the bay of Cadiz sent fifteen
of the government's best caravals to
the bottom.
In 1584 tho famous Armada, believed
to bo invincible, met her doom in the
English channel, eighty-one out of 13C
vessels sinking with most of their
crews. The loss of men is estimated
at 14,000.
Fourteen of Admiral Don Antonio
Navarro's vessels foundered in a storm
off tho Mexican coast near San Juan
de Ulloa in 1590.
Six years later a fearful storm In the
niscayan bay caused the loss of forty­
ono vessels belonging to the fleet of
Admiral Martin do l'adilla.
Not long after this Admiral Marquis
de Santa Cruz lost ten vessels, with 2,­
300 men, on the Corslcan coast
After a long pauso Gen. Jose Pizarro
lost five men-of-war in an engagement
with the English In 1741.
Within the last 125 years tho records
aro much easier of access and the
figures can be given absolutely correct.
In this time tho Spaniards lost twelv
large battleships under steam and
twenty-one first-class sailers, with
1,570 guns; twenty-tree frigates, with
BOO guns, and morn than 100 gunboats,
torpedo boats, brigs, galeotes, etc. The
loss of life in this period is conserva­
tively estimated at 20,500 men.
Thus the worst enemy of Spanish
supremacy on tho Rcas seems to be
other than man. More than double
the number of ships havo been lost by
the inclemency of tho elements than
were lost in battle. Philadelphia

Paris, Oct. 29. The newspapers this
morning express appreciation of the dif­
ficulties which are confronting President
Faure as a result of the resignation yes­
terday of the Kibot ministry.
Tho moderate Republican journals de­
plore the fact that the chamber of depu­
ties W88 not satisfied with the explana­
tions of the ministry regarding the fail­
ure of the government to prosecute those
whose names had been mentioned in con­
nection with the south of France rail­
road scandals.
The Radical and Socialist newspapers
hail the defeat of the Ribot ministry as
revenge for their own discomfiture in the
matter of the Carmaux strike, while the
Conservative organs state that the minis­
try has fallen on a question of public
morals and ""under a blow given by the
majority exasperated at repeated at­
tempts to hush flagrant scandals."",
Mo9t of the newspapers' opinion of the
circumstances point to tho formation of
a radical cabinet headed by M. Bour­
geois, whose last office was that of min­
ister of justice in the former Xtibot cab­
inet in 1S92, and who tried unsuccess­
fully to form a cabinet after the fall of
the Dupuy ministry.
Several newspapers however say that
they anticipate thai a dissolution of par­
liament must occur if the ""present state
of anarchy continues.""","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016014/1895-10-29/ed-1/seq-6,"","",6,"","",1,khi_inge_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Topeka state journal.,"","Topeka, Kansas","","",3796,20068,2696,4436,6,21488,25960,4,khi_inge_ver01/data/sn82016014/00295871295/1895102901/0219.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Topeka%2C_Kansas,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/khi_inge_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82016014%2F00295871295%2F1895102901%2F0219.jp2/pct:17.665674,77.303544,12.546538,17.087827/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/khi_inge_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82016014%2F00295871295%2F1895102901%2F0219.jp2/pct:17.665674,77.303544,12.546538,17.087827/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

entirely to a feeling of apprehension in the
public mind, which Increased in intensity
fiom day to day until It nearly reached the
proportions of a panic, and it was evident
to all who were familiar with the situation
that unless effectual steps were promptly
taken to check the growing distrust the
government would be compelled within a
few days to suspend gold payments and
drop to a depreciated silver and paper
standard. More than $43,000,000 of the
amount withdrawn during the brief period
last mentioned was not demanded for ex­
port, but was taken out by the people who
had become alarmed on account of the
critical condition of the treasury in its re­
lations to the currency of the country.
""The purchase of 3,500,000 ounces of gold
followed, it being in the contract that not
less than one-half of the gold was to be
procured abroad, but after a large part of
the gold had been furnished from abroad
the Secretary, in order to prevent disturb­
ance in the rates of foreign exchange at a
critical period, and avoid a condition which
would force gold exports and consequent
withdrawals from the treasury, acquiesced
in a departure from the literal terms of the
contract, that one-half of the coin should
be procured abroad, and accepted deposits
of gold then held in this country to com­
plete the delivery. Ordinary prudence de­
manded that the success of the plan io
protect the treasury against withdrawals
should not be endangered by insisting upon
a strict compliance with all the details of
the contract, especially as the government
could sustain no loss, and the whole
amount of gold stipulated for was secured.
The Bond Ittnnen.
""The amount of bonds issued under this
contract was $02,315,400, and the amount
of gold received was $65,116,244.0*2. The
beneficial effects of this transaction, the
Secretary says, were felt Immediately, not
enly in this country, but in every other
having* commercial relations with us.
""Confidence in our securities,"" he con­
tinues, ""was at once restored, and these
encouraging indications of increasing pros­
perity still continue, and it is reasonal^y

THE MINUET DANCER.

80, my enchantress in the flowered brocade.
Yon call an elder fashion to your aid,
Step forth from Gainsborough's canvas and
advance,
A powdered Galatea, to the dance.
Abont yon clings a faded, old world air,^
As though the link boys crowded round your
'chair,
As though the Macaronis thronged the Mall,
And the French hornswere sounding at Vaux­
hall.

They tread the stately measure to its close,
The silver buckles and the silken hose,
Ladies and exquisites, that bend and sway.
Brilliant as poppies on an August day.

You dance the minuet, and we admire,
We dullards in our black and white attire,
Whose russet idyl seems a mere burlesque,
Set in a frame so far less picturesque.

Yet I take heart: for Love, the eoatless rogue,
Can scarcely heed what raiment be in vogue,
Since in good sooth his negligence is known
As something scandalous anent his own.

And so he whispers. Eyes were bright and
brown
Long ere the powder tax dismayed the town,
And faithful shepherds still shall babble on,
Although the rapiers and the frills be gone.
—Alfred Cochrane in Spectator.

ODD FACTS ABOUT MADAGASCAR.

The Policemen Sleep on Their Beats—The
Curfew I so Ancient Use.

Probably the sleepiest policemen in
the world are those of Madagascar. At
Antananarivo, the capital, there is lit­
tle evidence of the force by day, for its
members are all peacefully wrapped in
slumber. At night, too, the guardian of
property is seldom to be seen, and that
he is actually guarding is only to be
told by the half hourly cry that is sent
up to police post No. 1 alongside the
royal palace.
""Watchman, what of the night?""
""We are wide awake, keeping a sharp
lookout, and all's well.""

Antananarivo has no lamps and no
streets. It is simply a great collection
of houses tumbled together. There is a
big force of night police, known as the
""watch."" The men gather themselves
together into groups, and choosing snug
corners, wrapping themselves in straw
mats, they drop into long and profound
slumber. One member of each group re­
mains awake to respond to the half
hourly call from the palace. As he calls
back, the others, half awake, mechan­
ically shout back the response. It makes
little difference, however, that the police
continually sleep, for robbery is rare.

Curfew, though popularly supposed
to be purely an early English and Nor­
man-French custom, has been estab­
lished in Madagascar for centuries. In
every town and village between 9 and
10 the watchmen go around shouting out
in the Malagasy dialect, ""Lights out!""
and they see that all is in darkness in
every house. After these hours no one
is allowed to travel around without a
special pass.

There is no criminal code of any ac­
count, and when a man is caught in the
act of stealing the populace is apt to
ignore the police and surround him and
stone him to death. The Madagascans
have no ""swear words"" in their lan­
guage, and when their feelings are over­
wrought against a man the only thing
they can do is to execute summary
vengeance on him.—New York World.

How Fast the Earth Moves.

Everybody knows that the earth makes
one complete revolution on its axis once
in each 24 hours. But few, however,
have any idea of the high rate of speed
at which such an immense ball must
turn in order to accomplish the feat of
making one revolution in a day and a
night. A graphic idea of the terrific
pace which the old earth keeps up year
after year may be had by comparing its
speed to that of a cannon ball fired from
a modern high pressure gun. The high­
est velocity ever attained by such a mis­
sile has been estimated at 1,626 feet per
second, which is equal to a mile in
3 2-10 seconds. The earth, in making
one complete revolution in the short
space of 24 hours, must turn with a
velocity almost exactly equal to that of
the cannon ball. In short, its rate of
speed at the equator is exactly 1,507
feet per second. This is equal to a mile
every 3 C-10 seconds, 17 miles a min­
ute.—St. Louis Republic.

Why Everybody Smiled.

An amusing scene was witnessed by
many pedestrians one day at the corner
of Thirty-seventh street and Broadway.
A fence, about 30 feet high, covered
with theatrical lithographs, incloses a
lot on that corner, where the founda­
tions of anew building are being laid.
It was the noon hour, and six brawny
sons of Erin were seated, on a slightly
raised platform, resting against the
fence. They were eating their luncheon
and were joking and laughing to their
hearts'content. Those who stopped to
look at the group could not withhold a
smile, for directly above this jolly group
of Irishmen, in bold, lurid letters,
were the words ""The Gay Parisians.""
Here indeed was a pleasant satire, the
result of accident. No wonder the work­
ingmen wondered why people smiled at
them so much.—New York Herald.

The Inquisitive Small Boy.

""Father,""said the little boy, looking
up from his picture book, ""if I ask you
a question, will you answer it?""
""Certainly,"" was the affable reply.
""And not get angry?""
""Of course not.""
""Nor say it's time I was in bed?""

I won't do any of those things.""
""Well, what I want to know is where
does a snake begin when it wags it*
tail?""—Washington Star.

A bright girl in Maine recently began
a composition thus: ""The Puritans
found a lunatic asylum in the wilds of
America."" She had read in a book that
the Puritans found an asylum in this
country, and to make the statement more
vivid she added the word ""lunatic.""

Fast Work and Fast Eating Make Three
Score Years and Ten a Ripe Old
Age in Tbese Days. : -
(From the Cincinnati Enquirer.)
Tbe American people live too fast, eat
too fast and drink too fast. This has
brought upon many of ns a train of nervous
and stomach disorders that are very diffi­
cult to manage. Investigation and chemical
analysis to discover such compounds as will
help those suffering from such ills has re­
sulted in the discovery of Dr. Williams
Pink Pills for Pale People, which has taken
very high rank as a specific remedy. -
H. P. Owens, a traveling man thirty
years of age, who is well known in this
community and generally liked because he
is a bright, energetic young fellow, resides
with his mother at 835 Central Avenue,
Cincinnati, Ohio. He has been a victim of
dyspepsia which took the form'of continu­
ous constipation, and, strangely enough,
his mother suffered from the same trouble.
Mr. OweDs testified to the merits of Pink
Pills in a most enthusiastic way, and said
to the Enquirer reporter:
' ""I am glad to say anything r can for Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills, because they did me
great good, and other people ought to know
of their virtues as a medicine in stomach
troubles. It was some, time ago when I
felt a heavy feeling in my stomach, and I
grew very constipated. I did not consult a
doctor, but having heard of the Pink Pills I
bought a box of them. In two or three
days the heavy feeling in my stomach dis­
appeared and my bowels were regular. I
did not have to use more than a box of
them before I was well. Since that time I
have only occasionally been troubled with
constipation, and I never get worried, be­
cause I know just what to do. Mother was
also troubled with indigestion and the
Pink Pills did the sumo for her they did
for me cured her, didn't they, mother.""
When appealed to Mrs. Owens answered:
'That is right. I found it was a great
med icioc, so easy to take and so quick and
lasting in its results.""
Mr. Owens continued:' ""I believe that
these pills are also good for nervousness.
When I had my stomach trouble I was also
quite nervous and that disappeared with
the dyspepsia. The Pink Pills were all that
is claimed for them. You can make any
use of this testimonial you 6ee lit.""
H. P. Owens has occupied several posi­
tions of trust in this city. Ho was for a
time an employe of the Commercial-Gazette.
He will go on the road in a few days for a
prominent business liouse hero. Mrs.
Owens is quite as enthusiastic as her son
about the Pink Pills and her host of lady
friends can verify her good opinion of this
wonderful remedy if they feel disposed to
do so at any time. Where the. testimony
is so general and unanimous as to the ex-
cellcncies of Pink Pills as tho Enquirer has
found it to be there is certainly good reason
to believe all the good things said about
the safe and simple remedy.

Climatic Perfection.
For an Inhabitant of the north tem
perate none the most nearly correct
climate would probably be the island
of Tasmania, which enjoys warmth
without heat and freahnese without
cold, and moreover possesses a climate
so equable that the average tempera­
ture ranges from 44 to S3 degrees, giv
ing a mean of about 62. In addition
to this, or possibly in consequence of it,
and the purifying effect of the aea
breezes, there is practically no disease
Mve what the Inhabitant are responsi
ble for. There are many groups of la­
lands in the South Pacific which fully
deserve the name of earthly paradise,
but they have the fault of being too
much like paradise. The valley of Caah­
mere In northern India and of Quito
in Ecquador poaaeas climates which
are almost perfect, but they suffer the
disadvantage of a great distance from
the aea. Australia is too dry and New
Zealand too damp to approach perfec­
tion ; but Tasmania poaaesaea the happy
mean which affords health and comfort
without the danger of degeneration
which is the penalty of more luxurious
clime. Of places near home, the lale
of Man probably moat nearly fulfills
the conditions of the question. Al­
though so much farther north, IU aver­
age temperature Is almost aa high and
quite as equable as that of the Isle of
Wight, but It poeaessea the additional
advantage of freedom from the fogs.

TESTING CHRONOMETERS.
The Interesting Process of Adjusting
Watches for Temperature.
Before a first-claBS watch is sold it
has to go through a variety of testa or
""adjustments,"" and one of the most
Important la the adjustment for tem­
perature.Chronometers are adjusted for tem­
peratures varying from 50 degrees to
90 degrees, as a rule, but some makers
esecially in France cool them down
to aero, and often they are heated to
120 degrees. Beyond this point It Is
dangerous to heat them, aa the oil
would be liable to Injury, and even the
works might suffer.
Pocket watches are adjusted for tem­
peratures varying from 35 degrees to 95
degrees. The process consists in put­
ting the watch in a close-fitting case,
and placing this in a cold room, or a
refrigerator with Ice, and leaving It
there for some time, altering the works
so as to make it keep regular time.
Then it is very gradually heated, great
care being taken not to let the moisture
in the warm air condense upon it.
Next it la put In a specially con­
structed oven, and heated to 90 or 100
or 120 degrees, the machinery being
again ad justed to go regularly. Chron­
ometers are usually kept a week in the
cold chamber, then a week in the hot,
and again a week in the cold chamber.
After that they are ready to make voy­
ages to any port between the equator

the contract, and as the season for gar­

he is daily besieged by congressmen
clamoring for their quotas. The deal­

so the congressmen have ordered the
entlro lot forwarded to Washington bo
that they can; give it their personal at­

A SINGLE DAY AT THE HOME OF THE NATION'S CANDIDATE

""This is the year when people all want
to vote. They are ready now to vote.
(Cries of 'We are, anyhow,' followed by
roat applause.) They know on which

side they mean to vote. (Cries of 'The

Republican ticket.') Why do they want
to vote that ticket this year? Because
they believe that involved in a Repub­
lican triumph is public confidence ami
the restoration of better times. They
have had some experience in the last
three years and a half and that experi­
ence has been most costly. Not a single
interest in the country but has suffered.
The government has suffered in its rev­
enues and the jeople iu their wages and
the prices of their products. In fact,
everything has suffered but the glorious
principles of the Republican party.
(Great cheering.)
""Protection, honest money, public mor­
als, reciprocity, the national honor, the
public credit—all emblazoned on the ban­
ner of Republicanism this year, and ral­
lying around that standard are men of ail
parties, all races, all sections, all creeds.
The white man, the black man, the
wage-earner and the employer, the pro­
fessional man and the business man. ail
have united and stand upon a common
platform, which platform is for our coun­
try and its honor. (Great, applause and
cries of 'Good!') I have heard from vour
spokesman today that West Virginia's
electoral vote this year will be for the
Republican ticket. (Cries of 'Right you
are.'^ This assurance gratifies my heart.

VASTNESS OP ST. PETERS.
It Produces Almost the Effect o 1 Terror on
the Mind.
The building is so far beyond any fa­
miliar proportions that at first sight all |
details are lost upon Its broad front. The I
mind and judgment are dazed and stag­
gcTed. The earth should not be able to
bear Buch weight up its crust without
cracking and bending like an overloaded
table. On each side the colonades run
curving otft like giant arms, always open
to receive the nations that go up there to
worship. The dome, broods over all, like
a giant's head motionless In meditation.
The vastness of the structure takes hold
of a man as he issues from the street by
which he has come from Sant' Angelo.
In the open space in the square and In
the ellipse between the colonades and on
the steps, 200.000 men could be drawn up
In rank and file, horse and foot and guns.
Excepting It be on some special occasion,
there are rarely more than 200 or 300 per­
sons in sight. The paved emptiness

maxes one draw a ore ait n or surprise, ana
human eyes seem too small to take In all
the flatness below, all the breadth before,
and all the height above.
Taken together, the picture Is too big
for convenient sight. The impression
itself moves unwleldlly In 'the cramped
brain. A building almost 500 feet high
produces a monstrous effect upon the
mind. Set down In words, a description
of it conveys no clear conception; seen
for the first time, the Impression pro­
duced by it cannot be put into language.
It is something like a shock to the Intelli­
gence, perhaps, and not altogether a
pleasant one. Carried beyond the limits
of a mere mistake, exaggeration becomes
caricature; but when it Is magnified be^
yond humanity's common measures, it
may acquire an element approaching to
terror. The awe-striking giants of my­
thology were hut magnified men. The
first sight of St. Peter's affects one as
though, in the every-day streets, walking
among one's fellows, one should meet
wMh a man 40 feet high.—“St. Peter’s,”

The Only Way.
Mr. William Spark in his ""Musical
Memoirs"" tells a story of the famous
Wesley which was related to him by
Mr. Bishop, tho London organ builder.
Wesley was a great extemporaneous
fugue player, and on the occasion to
which Mr. Bishop referred had been
asked to show off a new organ by play­
ing a voluntary at tho afternoon service
previous to the reading of the first les­
son. Before going to the organ ho asked
the vicar, who was an amateur organ­
ist, how long the voluntary should last.
""Oh,"" replied the vicar, ""please
yourself, Mr. Wesley. Say five or ten
minutes, but we should like to hear as
much of the different stops as you can
oblige ns with.''
When the time came, after a few pre­
liminary chords, Wesley started a fugal
subject, which, he worked out in a mas­
terly way in about a quarter of an horn-,
and tho vicar was about to commence
reading the lesson when the inexhausti­
te organist started a second subject,
id this ho developed in the same ab­
ruse, elaborate manner as the first.
The congregation at the end of half
hour began to show signs of weari­
ss. The vioar beckoned to Mr. Bish­
and begged.him to stop the too prolix
organist
""Oh, ""replied the organ builder, ""I
can soon stop him if yon give me au­
thority and will take the consequences.""
He approached the organ blower, and
holding up half a crown he said hur­
riedly: "" Come arad take this. I am just
going.""
The blower pumped the bellows full
and made for the half crown. Bishop
detained him until the wind went out
with a suck and a grunt, and poor Wes­
ley was left high and dry in tho middle
of his double fugue.
Qualifications Needed For Consulship,
Anybody at all familiar with the du­
ties of an American consul, anybody
who knows what is expected of him by
the department of state and what he is
called upon to do by the public, will
agree that ho should neither be (he prod­
uct nor the victim of capricious politi­
cal partisanship. He should be appoint­
ed upon has merits after careful, exami­
nation and retained upon tho same ba­
sis. There should be a career for the
consul. Th;re should be reward for
merit, and lie shoulel suffer for inccm-
Primariry the consul should be a gen­
tleman, meaning thereby an honorable
and educated man, familiar with the
amenities suid graces of good society.
The next and absolutely necessary re­
quirennnt should be an intelligent
knowledge of the language of the post
to which ho is assigned. He need not
be a professor of German or French or
Spanish or Italian, but he should be
»ble to speak and write intelligently
the language of the country to which
ho is commissioned.—Scribner's.

Nothing perhaps is more striking as
one becow-cs better acquainted with St.
Peter's than tho constant variety of de­
tail. The ast building produces at first
sight an impression of harmony, and
thcro appears to bo a remarkable uni­
formity of stylo in all the objects one
sees.
Thero aro no oil paintings to speak of
in the church :md but few frescoes. Tho
great altar pieces are almost exclusively
fine moraic copies cf famous pictures
which are preserved elsewhere. Of these
reproductions the best is generally con­
sidered to be that of Guercino's ""St.
Pctronilla"" at the end of the right aislo
of tho tribune. Desbrosscs praises theso
mosaic altar pieces extravagantly, and
even expresses the cpinicn that they are
probably superior in point of color to
the originals, from which they aro cop
ied. In execution they are certainly
wonderful, and many a stranger looks
at them and passes on believing them
to bo oil paintings.
They passers the quality of being im­
perishable and beyond all influence of
climate or dampness, and they aro mas­
terpieces of mechanical workmanship.
Bnt many will think them hard and
unsympathetic in outline and decidedly
crude in color. Much wit has been man­
ufactured by the critics at the cxpenso
of Guido Beni's ""Michael,"" for in­
stance, and as many sharp things could
bo said about a good many other works
of the same kind in the church. Yet,
on the whole, they do not destroy the
general harmony. Big as they are, when
they are seen from a little distance, they
pink into mcro insignificant patches of
color, all but lest in the deep richness
of tho whole. Marion Crawford in

Disrupted Democracy.
New York, July 17. A dispatch to
the Herald from Geneva, says: Col.
Henry Waterson, who is sojourning
with his family at Geneva, was inter­
viewed today by a correspondent of
the Herald, touching the Democratic
crisis in the United States. Col Wat­
terson has sought the seclusion of the
Swiss mountains, not merely for recre­
ation and rest, but for the purpose of
completing the life of Abraham Lin­
coln, on which he has been engaged for
some time.
""For more than a year,"" said Col.
Watterson, ""I have been out of active
politics, and on that account, I have
declined to be drawn into the discus­
sion of public matters and into expos­
ing myself to criticisms and responsi­
bilities which could not be met. You
see, I am not used to taking blows
without giving them, in controversial
combat, and I am loath to put myself
at a disadvantage in this regard. But
the condition of affairs at home is too
serious to justify the silence of any
man whose opinions may be desired.""
""What is it you particularly wish me
to speak of?""
""First, the ticket nominated at Chi­
cago.""""Personally, it is an unexceptionable
ticket. Mr. Bryan is a most worthy
and well educated young man, with a
talent for what passes for oratory. He
is fervid, sincere, poor and honest. Mr.
Sewall Is a Democrat of long standing
and credit. He is a millionaire from
Maine who, having nothing to lose po­
litically, thinks he can afford to grati­
fy caprice and amuse himself by play­
ing with Populism. It is a ticket that
may be made to arouse a good deal of
enthusiasm, both real and artificial.""
""And, the plat firm?""
""Monstrous. It not only means na­
tional repudiation and spoliation, but
is an open door to revolution. If the
leaders of this movement could come
into power those of them who have any
sense of accountability and conception
of orderly government would be quick­
ly set aside by the wild elements be­
hind. In this way civil war, as lore­
shadowed by the Chicago outbreaks
last year, could be precipitated upon
the country. Then the strong band of
the federal power was interoosed. but
If this were withheld the rei-n of the
mob would be easy enough.""
-''What of the proposal to put anoth­
er Democratic ticket in the field?""
""You will observe."" said Col. Wat­
terson, slowly weighing and measur­
ing what he said, ""that those who are
so quick to urge concentration of all
sound money men upon McKinley are
either Republicans who naturally seek
to swell their party ranks by such an
unexpected accession, or those Demo­
crats who, from a sense of sheer out­
rage and disgust, leap at conclusions,
not caring to take two bites at a
cherry.
""But there are considerations which
neither class takes into account. There
are from two to four millions of
staunch Democrats who may not be
so easily transferred from one party "".c
the other, yet whose votes can be made
just as effectual in suppressing an­
archy as the votes of those Republicans
who directly support McKinley. These
Democrats must have some abiding
place. They cannot find it under a flag
of which one-half is for sound money
and the other half for protection.
""Mr. McKinley cannot compromise
an issue which he has made the cor­
ner stone of his political belief. It is
true the money issue, not the tariff
issue, is in the ascendant now, but
there must be logical consistency in
all things, and neither Mr. McKinley
nor his party can ignore tariff pledges
without self stultification. Hence a
new Democratic convention with an­
other Democratic ticket and directed
by wise counsels, is the sole hope of
the Democratic future and would be
the one refuge for these Democrats
who have nowhere else to go.
""Failure to respect the convictions
and exigencies of these Democrats
would be in the highest degree un­
safe. As between Mr. McKinley and
Mr. Bryan, in the final outcome, Mr.
Bryan would probably get as many of
these votes as Mr. McKinley. while
many would refuse to go to the polls,
but a sound Democratic ticket would
get them all. Thus, after the election,
the opposition may be organized on a
sound basis and not relegated to the
wild horses of Populism for three years
more of ruinous agitation with another
life or death struggle at the end of
them.
""It Is not certain that a ticket headed
by Carlisle or Whitney and placed up­
on a real Democratic platform would
not get more votes than the ticket
headed by Mr. Bryan. Such a tickft
would not imperil the result, but would
assure it. The. complete disintegration
of the Democratic party is an event to
be contemplated by thoughtful per­
sons only with forebodings of evil.""

gin the day. Unueed to the services of
a maid at home, the girl experiences a
sense of luxury in having her stock­
ings put on for her even though one is
suro to he Inside out She also begins
to realize a sense of her own Impor­
tance, for in India she is distinctly a
personage and women are probably
at a higher premium there than in any
other civilized country. The arrival of
a new ""spin"" (as the unmarried girl is
colloquially termed) Is the cause of
much excitement in an Indian station,
aitd everybody Is on the alert to see
the latest addition to feminine society.
The day usually begins with a visit
to the badminton courts and there the
girl will run the gauntlet of critlcisni
from a large portion of her neighbors,
for it is a favorite meeting place. The
ladles eagerly scan every detail of her
dress; being fresh from home she
must, of course, have the newest fash
ions, and later on they will ask for
blouse, etc., as patterns. There are
also plenty of candidates of the oppo­
site sex eager to teach her badminton
and everyone's racket is at her dis­
posal. At 9 o'clock it is too hot for
further play and they drive home for
bath .and breakfast The bath, with
its water cooled in large earthenware
jars, is delightfully refreshing and the
tin mug wherewith to bale it over one's
person is a distinct novelty. Breakfast
is a meal of many courses, commencing
with porridge and ending with fruit
After breakfast the housekeeping has
to be seen to and this seems an easy
matter to the girl accustomed to that
duty at home, for it simply consists of
giving orders to the numerous servants
and dealing out the tinned ""Europe""
stores. Then there are flowers to be
arranged and at 12 o'clock callers he­
gin to arrive. The servant in the ve­
randa inquires If the mem sahib be
""at home"" and brings up a pile of
cards on a salver. Carriage follows
carriage in quick succession, for every­
body In the station is anxious to make
the new arrival's acquaintance. Only
the governor's wife and the general's
do not come, for it will be the girl's
duty to leave cards upon these impor­
tant personages. The bachelors of the
station arrive in groups of twos and
threes, thereby lending each other their
moral support should they feel nervous,
but they are all eager to meet and con­
verse on current topics with the ""spin.""
They Inquire whether she dances or is
fond of riding, and if the answer be
affirmative beg for a place on her card
at the first ball and put their ponies at
her disposal. By 2 o'clock tiffin, a rep­
etition of breakfast, is ready, and after
this meal people retire to their rooms
to read and a siesta is generally in­
dulged in.
After tea everybody goes out They
drive to the band-stand, where the regi­
mental band plays; there Is lawn ten­
nis for the energetic, or garden parties
at the club or meeshouse, and the new
arrival will be struck by theall-pervading
air of luxury. Servants are in
constant attendance, the carriages are
filled with comfortable cushions and
every tennis player has a email dark
boy at his elbow ready to hand him
balls. At 8 o'clock dinner takes place
and when there are no dances or even­
ing entertainments everyone goes to
bed early.
Certainly the daughter in India has a
really good time. Invitations to dances,
dinners and entertainments come rap­
idly for acceptance and if she can sing
or act she will be in great demand.
Everywhere the preponderance of men
strikes her and they vie with each other
in providing her with amusements. At
the races and shooting matches they
ask her to ""nominate"" them, when, if
her nominee wins, she will receive the
prize. The constant balls and dances
are rendered gay by innumerable uni­
forms, and the large proportion of men
makes that hardy perennial, the wall­
flower, an impossibility, and every girl
with the faintest idea of dancing has
her card filled to the twentieth extra.
Before the hot season, with its scorch­
ing winds, makes an exodus to the hills
general, she will have had several pro­
posals to exchange her position of
daughter for that of wife, for though
""spins"" on their first season are plenti­
ful, those In their second are rarer, and
those in their third are hardly to be
met with. Marriage Is a thriving in­
stitution in India, in spite of the van­
ishing rupee.
Although the lire of a girl in India is
frequently a round of pleasures and lit­
tle else, it need not be so, and though
there be not much in housekeeping to
occupy her energies, there is a vast
amount of other work to be done. She
will win the heartfelt gratitude of the
chaplain's wife by interesting herself
In the Sunday school for soldiers' chil­
dren and visiting their mothers in the
regimental liiye. Then, again, if she
takes the trouble to study the language
carefully ana learn more than the few
sentences required for ordering serv­
ants It opens up a world of interest too
little known to Europeans. Hidden
away behind the purdah in houses of
well-to-do natives are women whose
lives arc spent inclosed between four
walls and they gladly welcome anyone
who will dtvete a little of her time to


visiting them aai taking an Interest ta
their affairs, and the daughter will lad
the gratltnde of her Indian sister weU
worth the sacrif ca at an occasional tif­
fin party or plcnk. , ,

The largest and meet wmarkable
wedding since the world began task
place at Susa. When the great Alex­
ander had conquered Persia, wishing to
unito victors and vanquished by the
strongest ties possible, he decreed a
wedding festival. Now, guess how
many people he ordered to be married.
You -could never do It Well, Alexander
himself was to marry Statlra, the
daughter of Darius; 100 of his chief fl­
eers were to be united to ladles front
the noblest Persian and Median fami­
lies, and 10,000 of his Greek soldiers
I were to marry 19.090 Asiatic women
ZZ.20Z people were married at once.
I don't see how they managed to
get up a feast for so many, but they did,
and for a vast multitude of guests be­
sides. They had the most splendid ar­
rangements. On a plain near the city
a vast pavilion was erected on pillars
sixty feet high. It was hung and
spread with the richest tissues, while
the gold and precious stones orna­
mented it would have made your eyes
blink.
Adjoining this building were 100 gor
geous chamberj for the 100 bridegrooms.
Wblle for the remaining 10.000 an outer
court was inclosed and hung with costly
Vipestry, and tables were spread out
side for the multitude, a separate seat
was assigned each pair, and all were ar­
ranged In a semi-circle on either hand
of the royal throne. Each bridegroom
had received a golden vessel for his li­
bation, and when the last of these had
been announced by trumpets to the
multitudes without, the brides entered
the banquet hall and took their places.
And now don't you think each bride­
groom stood up separately and vowed:
""With this ring I now thee wed."" and
so on. No, the ceremony was very .sim­
ple; the king gave his hand to Statira
and kissed her as his wife, and the
other bridegrooms followed his exam­
pleCincinnati Tribune.

Famous old Gov. Henry A. Wise, of
Virginia, was directly or indirectly the
source of many a good story. Here is
ono that 1 do not think has found its
way into print: One day at a political
gathering he was approached by a well­
dressed individual, who shook hands
warmly with htm. The governor was a
bit bothered, and confessed he could
not recall the handshaker's 'name.
""Why, you must remember me. gov­
ernor,"" said the latter, ""I'm from Rich­

""Why, of course,"" said the governor,

A STUPENDOUS REPUDIA­
TION OF POPULISM.
Republicans Are in It.

Augusta, Me., Sept. 14.—Chairman
Manley of the Republican State com­
mittee sent the following telegram:
To the Hon. M. A. Hanna, Chair­
man Republican National Committee
—The Republican party has achieved
this day the most sweeping and mag­
nificent victory ever accorded to any
part> in the history of Maine.
We have carried every county in the
state; elected every state senator; at
least 140 out of 151 members Of the
house of representatives; secured
every county officer; given each mem­
ber of our magnificent delegation in
tlie house of representatives the largest
majority they ever received; elected
our candidate for governor by the
greatest majority ever given a candi­
date for that high ottiice; endorsed
the St. Louis platform and declared
for EcKinley and Hobart by 50,000
majority.

The Republican vote will exceed by
several thousands the largest Republi­
can vote • heretofore given, and the

Lincoln, Neb., Sept 9. The contin­
uous welcome Lincoln people and large
contingents from other part3 of Ne­
braska gave William J. Bryan on his
home-coming culminated yesterday
evening in a grand demonstration in
honor of his formal notification of hi3
nomination for the presidency by the
national silver party. Norris Hum­
phrey presided at the meeting and in­
troduced George A. Groot, of Ohio,
chairman of the notification commit­
tee, who made the liotification address.
Mr. Eryaa was immediately presented
and accepted the nomination of the
feilver party in the following words:
Mr. Groot, Chairman, and Other Members of
the Notification Committee of the Silver Party:
I beg to reply at this time without the formal­
ity of a letter. The platform adopted by the
sliver party contains but one plank, and that
plank, the plank upon the sliver question, la
identical la substance with the silver plank of
the Chicago platform.
As I have already discussed that plank at
length, it will not be necessary to enter into
any extended discussion at this time. I beg to
answer the committee that I accept the nomi­
nation tendered by them on behalf of the sil­
ver party In the spirit in which the nomination
was presented. lean appreciate the feeling
which animated those who assembled in that
convention. I can appreciate the hesitation
with which those assembled there turned their
backs upon the party with which they had
been associated. I know something of the
strength of party ties, and because I was in a
position where I looked forward.to a possibility
of like action on my own part, I can appreciate
the depth of the conviction that led them to
place the interests of their country above the
welfare of their party.
More than a year ago, when we were engaged
In a struggle to bring the democratic party to
an indorsement of iree coinage, the question
was put to me, whether, in case of failure, I
would support the democratic nominee if he
were a gold standard advocate, running upon a
gold standard platform. I never believed that
auca action was probable in the democratic
party then, but when thoe who questioned me
were not content with probabilities, and asked
again whether, In that event. I would support
the nominee, I said, as you will remember,
that under no circumstances would my vote be
given to a man who would, in the executive of­
fice, use his influence to fasten the gold stand­
ard upon the American people.
In 1831, on February in Memorial hall, at
Toledo, 0., at the Lincoln day banquet, the
present candidate for president upon the re­
. publican ticket used the words which I shall
Dow read to you. I have found those words
published in a Toledo paper, and they have
been published so long without correction that
vre may safely assume that they were correctly
reported. If he hereafter denies the correct­
ness of this report, I shall hasten to do him
Justice by retracting these words. These are
words which he is said to have used:
""During all of Grover Cleveland's years at
the head of the government he wa9 dishonor­
ing ene of our prescious metals, one of our own
great products, discrediting silver and enhan­
cing the price of gold. He endeavored even be­
fore his inauguration to office to stop the coin­
age of silver dollars, and afterward, and to the
end of his administration, persistently used
his power to that end. He was determined to
contract the circulating medium and demone­
tize one of the coins of commerce, limit the
volume of money among the people, make
money scarce and therefore dear. He would
have increased the value of money and dimin­
ished the value of everything else, money the
master, everything else the servant.""
Following these lines the republican conven­
tion in 1892 declared at Minneapolis that the
American people from tradition and interest
were in favor of bimetallism. Have traditions
changed In four years? Have interests changed
in four years? No, my friends, and yet forget­
ting the platform of 1838, forgetting the denun­
ciation uttered by this distinguished leader in
1331, forgetting the platform of 1892, the repub­
lican party in convention assembled declared
that the American people must forego the ad­
vantages of the bimetallic system, to which
tradition and Interest endeared them, until
foreign nations should bring those advantages
to them. It is not strange that men who had
looked for bimetallism in the republican party
should have given up hope and turned else­
where for relief. The republicans cannot be
criticised for leaving the republican party.
They have done what every American citizen
has a right to da
They have done better than our democratic
advocates of the gold standard have done, be­
cause the republicans, when they left the
party, joined with those who had. a chance to
succeed, while our democratic advocates of the
gold standard sought to secure the election of
republican candidates by nominating a demo­
cratic candidate. To show you that the action
Of the republicans is defended by experlenca
and by example let me carry you back to the
period just preceding the war. If you wiil turn
to a book recently published, entitled ""John
Sherman's Eecolections,"" you find on page 112
of the first volume a portion of a speech which
he delivered in congress in 18i6. Let me read
this extract:
""I am willing to stand by the compromises
of 1S2Q and'IS.iO, but when our white brethren
of the south alio-.v this administration to lead
them off from their principles, when they
baadon the position which Henry Clay would
have taken, forget his name a,nd achievements,
and decline any longer to carry his banner,
they lose all claims on me. And I say now
that until this wrong is righted, until Kansas
Is admitted as a free state, I cannot act in
party association with them.""
There was the distinguished senator from
Ohio asserting to the people of this country
tpon the floor of congress that he was willing
to accept compromise after compromise, but
the time had at last come when he could go
with them no longer, that until certain things
were accomplished he could not act with them.
The situation to-dsy is but a repetition of his­
tory.The chairman of the notification committee
has told you that we have to meet to-day a
great money trust He is right We are con­
fronted to-day by the most gigantic trust that
has ever been formed among mea. Talk about
trusts in various artkies which we produce.
My friends, all these trusts together fall into

trust which has its hands upon our country.

Men pouetsed of other trusts are not at apt to

itual gifts, wo are all loud to claim are con­
ferred for the good of humanity. We stnnd
ready to condemn relentlessly the men who, en.

their own advantage. But great wealth, espe­
cially If a man bas himself won It Is less apt to
be consldared a trust. The greed for It Is great
It Is often sought not for Itsolf. but for
the supposed distinction it confers. When
the young man of energy and ambition
looks forward to the attainment of It as the end

nobler desire of winning distinction and im­

Aa electrical engineer has been ex­
hibiting in London the model of his
proposed single-rail electric line for
speeds of 150 miles an hour. The rail
Is fixed on a Y-shaped trestle, and runs
up Into the body of the car, which, as
It ""were, runs astride on It .-The car
runs on twelve bearing wheels and
•eats 135 passengers with space for
their baggage. One of the difficulties
-net with in schemes for excessive high­
speed travel Is the tendency of the car
to run off the track. By running the
tail within tbe car the lateral.tendency
of the train is overcome. But in this
late scheme the great difficulty seems
to be the passenger. What would hap­
pen to the passenger when the train
took a sharp curve while going at 150
miles an hour Is not explained.

from his cose and handed it to his com­
panion.
""Let me introduce myself,"" he said.
""I just got in last night, and you may
be able to tell me what I want to know.""
""I am entirely at your service, Mr.
Thorndyke.""

The reply was prompt and courteous,
and Philip read ""Kobert Protheroe, C.
E."" on the card which was handed him.
""My physician has sent me here,"" he
explained, ""and he tells me I must live
out of doors. How shall I go about it?""
""How do you want to go about it?""

Philip laughed. ""I'll have to confess
that my plans are a trifle indefinite. I
had ah fdea that perhaps I might go
into the woods with the lumbermen or
the turpentine gatherers.""
""You're still too fax north for that

""Yes pulmonary.""

for consumptives—on better authority
than that of our friends of the pros­
pectus, I mean—and if 3r°u

""Yes please go on.""
""I shouid say that you might find out

""What is that?""
""Farmhouses where you can get any­
thing to eat besides bacon and com­
pone are not plentiful in this part of the
country.""

Having his recent experience with the
railway eating houses before him,
Philip shuddered. ""I'm willing to
rough it,"" he said, ""but I'm not anxious
to add dyspepsia to my other ailments.
Don't you suppose I could find a place
where the bill of fare wouldn't be quite
so limited?""
.""You'll find very few of them in

VI.

A RELUCTANT SAMARITAN.
Kobert Protheroe was not the man to
let a good resolution Warp in the cool­
ing. He was self-made, in the sense
that lie owed his parents little beyond
the fact of existence and the world,
after .its wont with waifs, human or
otherwise, had tempered him in a salt­
ish bath of adversity and sharpened
him upon the grindstone of experience.
Having mdde shift to climb some, in­
considerable distance up tho sJippery
hill of knowledge by -his own unaided
exertions, he fell easily into the habit
of thinking, himself more capable than
other men. The demonstration waa
simple and conclusive. He had proved
his ability to wring a measure of suc­
cess out of adverse circumstances where
others, with all the advantages of pre­
paratory training, had failed. He was
too kind-hearted to be cynical, but he
could not help making comparisons
and they wea-e usually unfavorable to
those who inspired them.'

In the short conversation on the ho­
tel veranda, Protheroe bad taken
Thorndylce's measure with a consider­
able degree of accuracy, and but for
the enlistment of his sympathies he
might have been inclined to look upon
the New Yorker afi a person who would
probably 8ferVe, upon better acquaint­
Since, to point the moral of another
comparison. As it was, however, crit­
icism was swallowed up in charity,
and 15 minutes after leaving Thorn­
dyke's room Protheroe was galloping
out one of the prospective streets,
which, tiirning abruptly around the
shoulder of John's mountain, became
a country, road leading up the valley

Valnable Information Supplied by the De­
partment of Agriculture.
The report of Secretary Morton, ol
the agricultural bureau, gives some
valuable information to growers who
intend shipping apples to Europe, and
especially to English markets. The sea­
son begins in August, when the domes­
tic crops come into the market, and ap­
ples bring comparatively low prices.
An occasional large crop in Spain or
Portugal may result in shipments to
England in August and September, but
usually the supplies are confined to the
home product. The bulk of English
apples, an average year, bring about
$1 to $1.75 per 112 pounds, but superior
kinds fetch much higher prices. Or­
dinarily, they are seen in the market
up to the end of January. This year
the crop was deficient, and was prac­
tically used up early in October, and the
market left clear for American and
Canadian fruit, which is practically all
that is available. Our early shipments
did not fairly represent us, and brought
low prices. Our European agent has
heard eomplaint of a decrease in the
size of the barrel, which usually netted
rather less than 100 pounds each; this
Ehould not be, it is a mistake which
must be avoided. Canadian barrels
weigh from 130 to 140 pounds. When
our shippers see Canadian Baldwins
quoted at from $2 to $2.50 per barrel,
this difference in weight will account
for it, and is no evidence of superior
quality on the part of Canadian fruit.
The bulk of the shipment consists of
Baldwins.Xorthern Spy and Greenings;
our Baldwins are finer than Cana­
dian, but are not such ""good keepers.'
They range from $2.50 to $3.50 for
Canadian barrels, and $2 to $2.75 for
American barrels, but it is thought that
these prices can hardly be maintained
on account of the large Canadian and
American crops. Greenings must be
large, as they are used for ""dumplings;
small samples would easily fall off a
dollar a barrel, aud make the shipment
unremunerative. Northern Spys bring
about the same price as Baldwins.
Freights to London, Liverpool, Glas­
gow or Bristol (all of them good apple
markets) are approximately $1 a bar­
rel, and all charges, including salesman,
commission, would be covered by 25
cents. Apples are sold at auction, cash
on delivery; if the auctioneer gives
credit, it is at his own risk. The ad-

dressesof responsible consignees in the
principal shipping ports in England
can be obtained through the agricul­
tural department, at Washington.
Any apples of good color and size
will sell in England, but it costs no
more to send the best than the medium
quality, nnd the return is better. ""If
you discard a shilling's worth in pack­
ing, you may better your price two
shillings,"" is the saying of a London
broker. Fruit should be packed so that
it cannot rattle; if itdoes, it will reduce
value considerably, even though it
might be uninjured.
FROST-PROOF CELLARS.
To Be Secured at a Small Kxpense of
Time and Money.
Many old cellars are not so proof
against frosts as to make the storingof
fruit in them an entirely safe matter.
A low temperature is certainly needed
to keep fruit in the best condition, but
the possibility of the mercury falling
MAKING CELLARS FROST PROOF.
below the safety point during a cold
snap is a factor to be guarded against.
A cellar can be made frost-proof by lay­
ing a single wall of brick inside the
underpinning, leaving an air space be­
tween the bricks and the outer wall, but
this is somewhat expensive. An easier
and cheaper way is to put up some short
studs just inside the underpinning, and
to nail upon these thin matched boards,
down to a point a little below the
ground on the outside of the cellar
wall, leaving an air space as shown in
the illustration. Fruit will then be out
of danger from low temperature out­
side. American Gardening.
ORCHARD AND GARDEN.
Young fruit trees must have good
tare to grow well.
When crops are grown in the orchard
be sure to manure it.
Thorough pruning is a prerequisite
to successful spraying.
Do not allow too many new plants
among the blackberries and raspber­
ries.Khubarb, asparagus, strawberries,
gooseberries and currants should be in
every garden.
If the vines or canes are too thick in
the rows the fruit will be small and of
an inferior quality.
Thick planting of trees is as much
against production as is crowding ol
plants in the garden.
The best remedy for an orange rust
on raspberries is to dig out every
affected cane and burn it.
During the winter is a good time to
plant out the small fruit plot and the
orchard.
If shrubs require pruning, the best
lime t do the work is just after the
flowering is over.
It is not too late to mulch the fall
planted onion sets if the work has not
been done before.
Apples in the cellar will keep much
better if care is taken to keep t he tem
perature even.
Whatever tends to produce or build
the treneral health and thrift of the
trees will also help to keep them free
from dise3.se.
So far as possible leave nothing on
the ground m the orchard that will
afford a harboring place for insect peft
4arig the winter. St. Louis EepubVs.

the traffic In the eggs of the seabirds of
the island must cease.
The mandate of the lighthouse board
will bring to a close a unique industry of
this city. The eggs of the Murre, or fool­
ish guillemot, have been shipped to the
markets of the city in great quantity
ever since 1S49. at which date they were
almost the only fresh eggs to be had,
bringing over l a dozen. The birds were
present In the breeding season from May
until August on the islands in such count­
less thousands that although persistently
robbed, their numbers seemed to show no
appreciable diminuation. In recent years,
however, naturalists have noticed the ef­
fect of the annual persecution of the vast
colonies, and several had fears that they
might become extinct. As a result of the
investigation, the prohibitive measure has
been enacted.
As high as 20.000 dozen of the eggs were
annually brought to market by the Greek
and Italian fishermen. They are twice
the size of an ordinary hen's egg, for
which they are said to be an excellent
substitute, and they sold at retail from
15 to 25 cents per dozen. During the past
four or five seasons the Greeks have been
driven off and the egg industry has been
carried on by the lighthouse keeper on
the Farrallones.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016014/1897-03-01/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,khi_inge_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The Topeka state journal.,"","Topeka, Kansas","","",3732,14372,2832,3396,4,22744,26300,4,khi_inge_ver01/data/sn82016014/00295871349/1897030101/0419.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Topeka%2C_Kansas,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/khi_inge_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82016014%2F00295871349%2F1897030101%2F0419.jp2/pct:16.408723,54.646388,12.451636,12.912548/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/khi_inge_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn82016014%2F00295871349%2F1897030101%2F0419.jp2/pct:16.408723,54.646388,12.451636,12.912548/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

President McKinley's political pro­

It can not be said of a bicycle rider
that he begins the way he should go,
It is a wise cyclometer that can show
ite master an extraordinary day's run.
As the handle bar is bent so shall the
spina! column of the rider be inclined.
A soft answer turneth away wrath,
but a soft tire filleth a man with evil
thoughts.
The man who looketh behind him in
crowded path would better be a pillar
of salt.
The bicycle hath wisdom which sub- !
I
:
milteth to the charge that it is at fault,
and not its master, for running two
days alike during the week.
The rider whopursueth his way with
his head bowed runneth to his own des­
truction.
As the spoke is bent, so shall the
path «if the bicycle deviate from the
straight and narrow way.
The oil cup that goeth too long
Covered will become possessed of it« j
much grit as the rider of the bicycle
thereof.

It is not mete that bicycles should
greet each other with clasping of hand.
Rather let them pay a formal, distant
greeting.

Negro Taken From the Court
and Hanged in Alabama.
Montgomery, Ala., July 16. Yester­
day Major Terrill, a negro, criminally
assaulted Mrs. Martin Thomas, a white
woman, living in the country five miles
from Elba, Ala.
She was alone in the house with her
six months old baby. After the assault
the woman was struck in the head and
thrown on the bed beside her sleeping
infant. Fagots of pine wood were then
placed upon her by the brute and set
on fire.
The flames attracted some passersby
and they rescued the woman in time to
get her dying statement. The baby was
saved. Terrill was arrested and was
being given a preliminary trial when
the mob broke up the court and took
him out and hanged him.

But is there such a thing as rabies,
and such a thing as a mad dog?
Undoubtedly there is, though I have
never seen one. In the thirty years
since The American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
was established, our officers and
agents have been constantly on the
outlook, but no undoubted case baa
ever fallen undor their observation,
or within their knowledge ; and, of
over 180,000 dogs and other small
animals which have been cared for
at our shelter during the past three
years, not one singlo case of rabies
has been found. These facts suffi
ciontiy prove tnat rabies is rare in
this city and in this state ; but there
is such a disease, and it is import.
ant lor tne public, as well as your
self, that you should know whether
a sick dog is or is not rabid. If you
will note the following fact, you
will have no difficulty. You will
probably find them to bo quite dif
ferent from the popular fancies by
which most persons are misled.
1. It is supposed that a mad dog
dreads water. It is not so. Tho
mad dog is very likely to plunge bis
head tothe eyes in water, though he
cannot swallow it and laps It with
difficulty. m
2. It is supposed that a mad dog
runs about with evidences of intense
excitment. It is not so. The mad
dog never runs about in agitation;
he never gallops ; he is alway s alone
usually in a strange place, where he
jogi along slowly. If he is ap­
proached by dog or man, no shows
nu sign of excitement, but when the
dog or man is near enough, he snaps
and resumes his solitary trot
3. If a dog barks, yelps, whines,
or growls, that dog is not mad. The
only sound a mad dog is ever known
to emit is a hoarse howl, and that
but seldom. Even blows will not
extort an outcry from a mad dog.
Therefore, if any dog, under any
circumstances, utters ' any fother
sound than that of a hoarso howl,
that dog is not mod.
4- It is supposed that the mad
dog froths at the mouth. It is not
so. If a dog's jaws are covered or
flecked with white froth, that dog
is not mad. The surest of ull sigps
that a dog Is mad is a thick and ropy
brown mucus clinging to his lips,
which he often tries vainly to tear
awuy with his paws or to wash
away with water.
S. If your1 own dog is bitten by

any other dog, watch him carefully.
If ho is infected by rabies, you will
discover signs of it possibly in from
six to ten days. Then ho will be
restless, often getting np only to lie

down again, changing his position
impatiently, turning from sido to
side, and constantly licking or
scratching somo particular part of
his head, limbs, or body. He will
be irritable and inclined to dash at
other animals, and he will some­
times snap at objects which he
imagines to be near him. He will
be excessively thirsty, lapping water
eagerly anil often. Then there will
bo glandular swollings about his
jaws and throat, and ho will vainly
endeavor te rid himself of a thick,
ropy, muoous discharge from his
mouth and throat. If ho can. ho
will probably stray away from home
and trot slowly and mournfully
along the highwoy or cross country,
meddling with neither man or
beast, unless they approach him,
and then giving a singlo snap. Tho
only exception to this behavior oc
curs in ferocious dogs which during
tho earlier sta go of excitment, may
attack any living object in sight.
These symptons of rabies are con
densed from valuable information
rocoived from physicians of undoubt
ed authority.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87080417/1897-07-16/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,pst_jordan_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Pike County press.,J.H.

her husband was robbed of S6OO on the
night when he was murdered, and she
has the numbers of the notes. They
were found on George when he was ar­
rested in New York.”
We were hurrying toward the court­
house, but my friend spoke rapidly.
""Nlrs. Hartley swears that Theresas
some noise in the lower part of the
house that aroused her and she went
down. When she returned the window
had been forced open, the money stolen
and the husband lay on the floor dead,
with a horrible wound on the back of
his head. George ran away that night
on the midnight train to New York.”
We were at the courthouse by this
time and pressed our way through the
crowd, who were listening to the evi­
dence that threatened to hang George
Hartley for murder. I made my way to
tlu seat w here the lawyer who was de­
fending him was gravely listening to
the witness on the stand. The prisoner
was looking down as I bent over and
whispered to his lawyer, but suddenly
looking up he saw me. One great shout
broke from his pale lips:
""Heaven has sent you! lam saved!”
and fell senseless on the floor. Had he
studied the effect for months he could
not have made it more convincing. Not
a man in that crowded room doubted his
innocence then.
My evidence was taken, and being a
man well known in Holton, it was suffi­
cient to prove George Hartley guiltless.
As 1 told the true story of the money,
I could see that the sympathy of ail was
with the prisoner. All Bolton knew how*
hard a parent his father had been.
The jury were out but a few moments
to return with the verdict: ""Not
guilty!” and George and 1 left the court
room arm in arm, followed by the cheer­
ing of the crowd. We found Elsie w hite
and trembling in the parlor, waiting
tor us.
""You are not angry because I came
back?” she pleaded, clinging to me. ""I
heard the news in Boston and auntie
came home with me. I knew George
was innocent, even before I saw him,
and it comforted him to sec me,” she
said, turning to her lover.
I did not doubt that, as I saw them
dinging together, their faces still pale
with recent sorrow, but a glad light
shining in their eyes.
’Hie mystery' of John Hartley’s death
lias never been solved. His son thinks
he w as not murdered but fell and struck
his head. Ilis stepmother’s hatred of
him and the fact that his death would
make her the heiress of her husband’s
wealth were sufficient motives for her
accusation.
By life father’s will, George Hartley
inherited his entire estate, with a life
income to Mrs. John Hartley that is
punctually paid. He was a far wealthiei
man than was supposed and George
Hartley is to-day one of the richest men
in Bolton and the happiest of husbands
and fathers. Eh, Elsie?
""He is here to answer for himself,”
she answered, as we saw a tall figure
come up the garden path, the figure of
tne man w hose innocence I had proved
just in time, ten years before.—N. Y

""You can't de­
pend on women,
they get ill too
often."" That was
the explanation of
a business man,
who, contrary to the
prevailing custom,
employed male ste
nographers and type-writers. If every
young woman would take the right care of
her distinctly maidenly self, this complaint
would never be heard. The woman who
suffers from weakness and disease of the
delicate feminine organs is unfitted for her
duties, either in the house or in the office.
Young unmarried women, especially, do
not like to confide their troubles of this
nature to their home doctor. They shudder
at the thought of the examinations and
local applications to which they may have
to submit. These are entirely unnecessary!
and all letters addressed to Dr. R. V. Pierce.
Buffalo, N. Y., are held in the most sacred
confidence. Dr. Pierce ha9 been for thirty
yeare chief consulting physician to the In­
valids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, at
Buffalo, N. Y., one of the greatest medical
institutions in the world. His neighbors
made him congressman and he was a per.
sonal friend of the martyr-president. Dr.
Pierce's Favorite Prescription cures all
weakness and disease of the delicate and
important organs of femininity, upon which
depend a young woman's health. Honest
druggists don't substitute.
' I have recommended your ' Favorite Prescrip­
tion ' to a great many of my friends, and there
has not been a single lady who used it, but was
cured by it. It is the best medicine for females I
have ever taken, I tried ftmr doctors and they
did me no good. Thev said I was bound to die ; ""

The word “toast” used for describing
the proposal of a health in an after-din­
ner speech dates back to mediaeval times,
when the loving cup was still regarded as
an indispensable feature of every ban­
quet. The cup tfould be filled to the brim
with wine or mead, in the center of which
would be floating a piece of toasted bread.
After putting his lips thereto the host
would pass the cup to the guest of honor
seated on his right hand, and the latter
would in turn pass it on to his right-hand
neighbor. In this planner the cup would
circulate round the table, each one pres­
ent taking a sip while drinking toward his
right-hand neighbor, until finally the cup
would come back to the host, who would
drain what remained and swallow the
piece of toast in honor of all the friends
assembled at his table.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86063034/1897-09-26/ed-1/seq-20,"","",20,"","",1,gu_fletcher_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The morning news.,J.H.

LONDON, Oct. 15, 1897.—Colonel Jose
Zayas, who says he is accredited by the
Pklma Cuban Junta of New York as
Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain
from the Cuban Republic, in an interview
is quoted as expressing the belief that the
war in Cuba will not last another year.
Spain, he adds, cannot finance the cam­
paign, and should have accepted the in­
surgents' offer of $150,000,000 under the
guarantee of the United States.
Colonel Zayas does not anticipate as­
sistance from the United 'States,, claiming
that all the Cubans desire is fair play and
the recognition of belligerent rights, so
that they can secure the necessary sup­
plies for their troops. In conclusion the
Cuban Mnister is quoted as saying:—
“There is no truth whatever in the opin­
ion expressed in England that the Cubans
desire annexation to the United States.
We are fighting for independence and do
not hanker after annexation, which will
not be the outcome of the struggle. There
s not the least likelihood of the Cubans
accepting autonomy. ‘Independence or
death,’ is our motto.”

Pullman was born in Chautauqua coun­
ty. New York. March 3, 1S31. At 14 he
began life as a clerk in a country store,
later associating himself with an older
brother in the cabinet making business
at Albion. He came to Chicago in 1S59.
and at first engaged in the business of
raising buildings, elevating entire
blocks a number of feet to bring them
up to new street grades. .
While riding in an old-fashioned
sleeping car from Buffalo to Westfield.
N. Y., it occurred to him that there
was a field for building comfortable
sleeping coaches. From 1859 to 18U3 he
made a series of experiments on the
Chicago & Alton and Galena roads.
Prom these experiments he worked out
detailed plans. A workshop was rent­
ed, skilled mechanics employed and Mr.
Pullman threw himself into the task
with the ardor of a man who moves
from settled convictions. Although
without mechanical training himself.he
personally directed the work of others
in all the minor details of putting the
idea he had originated into material
form. The first car, the ""Pioneer"" was
completed early in 1SC5, and immediate­
ly took rank as the most perfect rail­
way vehicle the world had ever seen.
This was the beginning of the Pullman
system, which has grown to the pres­
ent enormous proportions.
Mr. Pullman was identified with al­
most every public enterprise in Chi­
cago.The industrial town of Pullman,
within the city limits of Chicago, now
contains over 11,000 inhabitants. Mr.
Puiiman was a brother of the Rev. Dr.
J. M. Pullman, of New York, former ed­
itor of the Christian Leader.

The first political campaign of the
Greater New York is fully described
in the American Monthly Revew
of Reviews for N vember. The
story is worth reading. No such
contest as this has ever been known
before in municipal politics. The
issues .involved are tremendousi
and the personnel of the leaders
has a unique interest. The editori
al comment in the Review's ""Pm
gress of the World"" illumines the
situation, and the subject is further
enlivened by a selection of the
most striking cartoons from the
daily press.

GLASGOW'S FAMILY HOMES. '
Among the many new things recently
started by the Blasgow Corporation is

a ""family home."" It is intended main.

ly for widowers and widows who go

out to work. There are a hundred bed­
rooms, each of which contains a good
bed for the father or mother and a
broad cot for the younger children
For these rooms the parents pay 5s. 6d

a week, and that sum includes the
lighting, heating and cleaning of them
Clean linen is supplied once a week
In the home also there are dining, re­
creation and nursery rooms. The chil­
dren are looked after and cared for
while the parents are at work for an in­
finitesimal sum. The cooking, washing
and bathing arrangements are excel­
lent; and as the thing is done on a
large scale and economically arranged
the establishment is expected to pay
for itself. Glasgow benevolence i

nothing if not practical, and this new
home seems a most admirable institu­
tion.

THE COURT JESTER.'""
A Practical Joke That Will Sommers
Played on Cardinal Wolsey.
Amelia Wofford t£lls of “The Court
Jesters of England” in St. Nicholas.
The following is related of King Henry
VIII'h jester:
Sommers, like Scogan, liked a prac­
tical joke, and one that he played on
Cardinal Wolsey is thus quaintly told
by Arm in:
“Of a time appointed the king dined
at Windsor, in the chappel yard at Car­
dinall Wolsey’s at the same time when
he was building that admirable work
of his tombe, at whose gate stood a
number of poore people, to be served
with alms when dinner was done with­
in, and as Will passed by they saluted
him, taking him for a worthy person­
age, which pleased him. In he comes,
and finding the king at dinner and the
cardinall by attending, to disgrace him
that he never loved, Harry, sayes hee,
lend me £10. What to doe? saies the
king. To pay three or foure of the car­
dinally creditors, quoth hee, to whom
my word is past, and they are now come
for the money. That thou shaft, Will,
quoth hee. Creditors of mine? saies the
cardinall. lie give your grace my head
if any man can justly aske me a penny.
No, saies Will. Lend me £10. If I pay
it not where thou owest it, lie give thee
£20 for it. Doe so, saies the king. That
I will, my liege, saies thee cardinall,
though I owe none. With that he lends
Will £10. Will goes to the gate, dis­
tributes it to the poore and brought the
empty bag. There is thy bag againe,
saies hee. Thy creditors are satisfied,
and my word out of danger. Who re­
ceived, saies the king, the brewer or
the baker? Neyther, Harry, saies Will
Sommers. But, cardinall, answer me in
one thing, to whom dost thou owe thy
soule? To God, quoth hee. To whom
thy wealth? To the poore, saies hee.
Take thy forfeit, Harry, saies the foole.
Open confession, open pennance. His
head is thine, for to the poore at the
gate I paid his debt, which hee yields
is due, or if thy stony heart will hot
yield it so, save thy head by denying
thy word and lend it.mee. Thou know­
est I am poore and have neyther wealth
nor wit, and what thou lendest to the
poore God will pay thee tenfold. * * *
The king laught at the jest, and so did
the cardinall for a shew, but it grieved
him to jest away £10 so.”

A Poser For Bradlaugh
When the late Mr. Bradlaugh was once
engaged in a discussion with a dissenting
minister, the former insisted on the latter
answering a question he had asked him by
a simple “Yes’ or “No,” without any more
circumlocution, asserting that every ques- ,
tion could be replied to in that manner.
The reverend gentleman rose and in a
quiet manner said: “Mr. Bradlaugh, will
you allow me to ask you a question on
those terms?”
“Certainly,” said Bradlaugh.
""Then, may I ask, have you given up
beating your wife?”
This was a poser, for if answered by
“Yes” it would imply he had previously
beaten her, and if by “No” that he con­
tinued to do so.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn86072192/1897-12-24/ed-1/seq-4,"","",4,"","",1,au_abernethy_ver01,"","","",true,ca,The age-herald.,Age-Herald,"Birmingham, Ala.","","",12140,7284,2777,2705,4,18624,26560,0,au_abernethy_ver01/data/sn86072192/00340583267/1897122401/0691.jp2,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Birmingham%2C_Alabama,en,"","","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/au_abernethy_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn86072192%2F00340583267%2F1897122401%2F0691.jp2/pct:65.184708,27.424699,14.910868,10.184488/full/0/default.jpg","https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/iiif/2/au_abernethy_ver01%2Fdata%2Fsn86072192%2F00340583267%2F1897122401%2F0691.jp2/pct:65.184708,27.424699,14.910868,10.184488/!80,100/0/default.jpg"

CHICAGO, Dec. 24.—A fire tonight

Sixty-third street and Stony island

The fire was one of the quickest ever

Coliseum was a pile of twisted Iron and
hct bricks, was not more than twenty
minutes. The building had been rent­

The House committee on commerce to­
day voted to report the antl-tieket scalp­
ing bill in the form of a substitute pre­
pared by Mr. Sherman of New York. The
sulis-itute follows the general lines of the
original bill, with some additional fea­
tures. It places a penalty on railroad offi­
cers who deal with scalpers. Heretofore
the plan has been to hold the cori?oration
liable, but the new provision extends the
liability to officials, making them subject
to a misdemeanor, with line or imprison­
ment on conviction. A new paragraph Is
Inserted in section 2, making it unlawful
for general passenger agents to supply
tickets to other than authorized ticket
agents. . ,
Another clause provides that unused
tickets shall be redeemed at any time
within one year. Any company failing to
redeem a ticket is made liable in a civil
action to a penalty of $100 in excess of the
redemption money on the ticket. Mr.
Sherman will write the report and present
it tomorrow.

A bot fomentation is sometimes need­

not necessary to wait for water to be
heated in the usual way. Soak the flan­
nel m cold water, wring as dry as de­
sired, fold in a newspaper and lay upon
the store or wrap it about the stove­
pipe. In a few minutes it will be as
warm as the patient can bear. The pa­
per keeps the pipe from becoming
moistened by the wet flannel and at
tho same time prevents tbe flannel from
being soiled by contact With the pipe.
Fomentations thoroughly applied will
relieve most of the local pains for which
liniments, lotions and poultices are gen­
erally applied and are greatly to be pre­
ferred to these remedies since they are
cleaner and aid name more effectually
in restoring the injured parts to a sound
condition.
The fomentation may be changed fre­
quently, and after it has been removed
massage may be given either by the per­
son himself or another, so as to

KITTIES IN A JUNKSHOP.
Tlier Are Maehluee That Are
Trltitxght For $l.
“Got any kitties?” •
The junk dealer looked startled, for
the question betokened an intimate
knowledge of tbe jargon of his kind.
“Why, yes, I guess so."" he responded
when he could got his breath. What
the buyer meant was an old sewing ma­
chine which could be turned in to the
sewing machine company as part pay­
ment on anew machine. Tho company
allows |6 on an old machine, and some­
times the agent or canvasser allows #5
more out of his commission on tbe sale.
The public £gagines that in some
way these old machines are valuable to
•tfie company, bnt, in truth, they are of
use only as arguments in forcing a sale.
In the standard makes of machines there
is supposed to be absolutely no out in
prices, and the only way that a seeming
reduction can be made is by taking in
an old machine and allowing for it.
Tbe company does this not for the suke
of getting the machine, but for the sake
of making a trade. Once the old timer
is in, their possession it is broken up and
sold to ""a junk dealer.
The companies know, of course, that
a large number of the families who
turn in old machines said to have been
bought by them before tbe flood really
come from the secondhand stores and
cost only ft. At this rate the buyer gets
an allowance of #lO, which, deducting
the $l, leaves net $9. If there docs hap­
pen to be an old one In the possession of
the family, the whole #lO is realized.—

ty when he met a poor man with a
poorer horse that bad fallen under his
load. They were both in distress, and
Mr. Herbert pulled off his coat and
helped the man to unload his horse, e
tbun gave him some money and left
him. At his arriving at Salisbury his
friends wondered at his coining into
their company so soiled and discom­
posed. He. explained the cause, and
when one remarked that he had dis­
paraged himself by so dirty an employ­
ment he answered that the thought of
what he had done would prove musio to
him at midnight and that tbe omission
of it would have upbraided and made
discord in his conscience. ""For if lam

were going round freely, and when one
of. the ""boys' turned down bis glass
there was considerable remonstrance on
the part of his companions at his refus

Tbe white haired man quietly cut the
discussion short by saying, ""That re­

Tbe old drummer flicked tbe ashes
from bis cigar and settled back in bis
chair. ""It was a long time ago,"" said
be, ""and it was in the old American
House in this city. There were five
young men seated in a room, just as we
are here tonight, only they were all feel
ing 'pretty good,' and there wasn't, any
old man around to bore them with a
story. But along about midnight one of
the party turned down his glass just as
my young friend hero has done. He said
be bad had enough, and goodness knows
he bad. His determination was greeted
most hilariously as a good joke. He
6teadily declined,' however, though the
wine was brousht and set before him,
but the taunts and innuendoes of his
comrades finally exasperated him so that
ho exclaimed rather petulantly, but half
in fun, 'Well, boys, 1 11 30m you once
more if you will drink to an early grave

iously and drank standing. But some-
bow after that the fun was not so furi

seemed to half realize that to drink to a
man's death wasn't such a good joke
after all, and one by one they made ex
cuses and went off to bed.""
Here tbe old man paused.
""Did the man die?"" queried he who
bad refused to ""have another"" with

""No,"" was the reply. ""Ho is the only

THE SANCY DIAMOND.
This Magnificent Jewel Will Be Owned by
Pauline Aator.
In tho ordinary course of events Miss
Pauline Astor will some day become
possessor of tbe most famous and mag
nificent diamond owned outside of
crown treasure. The gem in question is
the world famous Sancy diamond, owned
by her father, and were it to appear
among the jewels worn at any court
function or royal drawing room it would
entirely throw into the shade every oth
er gem there except the Kohmoor,
which tbe queen always wears on state
occasions as a ""brooch.
Tbe Sancy is a stone which is pos
sessed of a remarkable history. Weigh
ing about 54 carats, it at one time
formed part of tbe crown jewels of
Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy,
and on bis death in battle m Switzer
land was found set cither in his helmet
or sword hilt."" Tho Swiss sold it to the
French' king of the day, and from that
time forth it became one of tbe crown
jewels of France.
It disappeared at the time of the revo­
lution, reappeared at the restoration
and at the time of the second revolu­
tion in. 18 80 passed by purchase into
the possession of Anatole Demidoff, the
Muscovite millionaire. It was worp for
a time by Demidoff's wife, Princess
Mathilde Bonaparte, but be took' it
from her before their separation and
then bequeathed it to his nephew, Paul
Demidoff. Tbe latter sold it in the six­
ties for the sum of. $200,000, a ridicu­
lously 6mall price, to the late Sir
Jamsetjee Jejeehobboy, the Parsee mil­
lionaire and philanthropist of Bombay.
After bis demise his heirs put it once
more in the market, and it was pur­
chased by William Waldorf Astor by
private contract, no mention being made
of the price paid. Philadelphia Times.

At an anniversary of a deaf and dumb
asylum, one of the children wrote upon
the blackboard words as sublime as the
Iliad, the Odyssey, and the “Divina Corn­
media,"" all compressed in one paragraph
The examiner, in the signs of the mute
language, asked her: ""Who made the
world?” The deaf ttnd dumb girl wrote
upon the blackboard, “In the beginning
God created the heaven and the earth.”
The examiner asked her, ""For what pur­
pose did Christ come into the world?”
The deaf and dumb girl wrote ui>on the
blackboard: “This is a faithful saying
and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sin­
ners.” The examiner said to her, “Why
were you born deaf and dumb, while I
hear and speak?” She wrote upon the
blackboard: ""Even so. Father; for so it
seemeth good In thy sight.” Oh. that we
might lie baptized with a contented spirit.
The spider draws poison out of a flower,

\ isitors to the dead letter office who turn
the leaves of the Immense photograph al­
bums to examine the soldiers' picture*
saved time In war and gazed down at
the long table where a dozen men are open­
ing letters never realize the amount of
work It takes to produce order in the chaos
of letters and parcels gone astray. Hanged
along the sides of the great room where
the openers are. and also in se veral rooms
near by. are the bookkeepers or recorders.
Their labor is seldom appreciated because
its results only are seen. Without them
it would be impossible to answer the many
inquiries for missing: mail, or to locate any
article which the office has received. I'ncle
Sam's business methods are often criticised
as intricate and laborious, but the neces­
sity of a system of records of this kind
cannot be doubted.
Al?out fifteen per cent of the seven mill­
ion pieces received yearly contain valuables.
An accurate record of each article is made,
giving its aidnc* and disposition. 0(X s? ts
of books are used for this purpose, one for
money one for paj?ers which have a money
value, as notes and mortgages; one for
other valuable papers such as receipts and
certificates; one for stamps, one for photo­
graphs. and one for property or miscel­
laneous articles received In packages.
These are all returned to the sen ler if
the address is given. If there is no address,
but a legible postmark, they are sent to the
postmaster at the matting office for deliv­
ery to the sender. If there is BO
and 110 postmark, or if the postmaster fails
to deliver the article and returns it to the
department, it is filed.
HlM|?OMlnK of (he \rlielew.
In the case of property the articles filed
are kept two years and then sold at public
auction, excepting such books as are se­
lected for the department library. Several
hundred l?ooks are added each year to the
library, which is for the use cf the officials
and clerks exclusively. They comprise
largely works of liction and poetry intend­
ed for gifts.
The rngney, which cannot be returned to
the owner, is kept for three months and
then deposited in the I'r.ited States treas­
ury. It may be reclaimeJ within four
years. In these l>ooks one cent receives as
much attention as Sail, a receipt being
signed by each clerk through whose hands
it passes. No red tape is si>ared on account
of small values.
The stamps are the most numerous of all
valuables received. Ever> time th depart­
ment issues a fraud order aga.5nst any
swindling concern that concern is not al­
lowed to receive Its mail. Its letters are
stamped ""fraudulent"" and sent to tlie dead
letter office. Thousands of dollars yearly
are thus saved by the department and r?v
stored to the people In money and stamps
alone. The stamps which cannot Ue de­
livered are destroyed each month.
The photographs and valuable papers
which had been kept on file were allowed
to accumulate until the summer of lWU,
when the oldest files were destroyed, ex­
cepting only such papers as marriage cer­
tificates, wills and others of exceptional
value. At present, only those photographs
and papers filed within the last three years
are kept Intact. The rest are destroyed.
I nole Smii (he (iniuer.
Thus, TTncle Sam, with Yankee practi­
cality, utilizes everything that comes in
his way. He realizes a neat little sum each
year from the auction sale of packages,
from the deposit of lost money, and alpo
from the destroyed matter sold as waste
paper.
In addition to these records is a book
which gives the postal history of lost
manuscripts, which numl>er a!?out one
thousand yearly.
There is also a record of inquiries for
missing mail, and a record of registered
matter. The registered articles received
are not distributed among the six desks
named, but a separate record is kept of
them, so that these are the largest of the
record books and the articles kept on file
here are miscellaneous in character.
Every month the periodicals which have
gone astray in the mails and ret.-hod the
dead letter office are distributed among the
charitable institutions of the Pistrict. They
are the department missionaries that cheer
the sick and bless the lonely.
It is expected that the recent order to
IK*?tmasters in regard to the plainer stamp­
ing of letters will facilitate the work of
this office to a large degree. Postmasters
are now or-1. red t"" .?:* h le ter .li­
tinctly with the name ol' the mailing office.
It sometimes requires half a dozen clerks
with magnifying lens and every facility for
""blind reaiing"" to decipher a single |?os:­
mark. This kind of stamping is usually
done in the smaller offices. The letters
from large cities almost always have a
legible i>ostmark. When this ruling is en­
forced the percentage of matter returned
will be largely increased.
Amount Deerettslnif.
The amount of matter received a* the
dead letter office has decreased in the last
few years. This is probably due to the ef­
ficiency of the ""Don't"" circulars, which are
sent to all postmasters for the dis*emina­
tion of ordinary rules of precaution to be
observed by patron* of the mails.
This office mig""ht be called the headquar­
ters of Santa Claus. At any rate it fs where
his mail Is received. Every autumn his let­
ters come in by hundreds and later by thou­
sands. There is every variety of spelling
and childish chirographv. Th?-re is also a
variety of places assigned as his abiding
place, such as the North Pole, Fairyland
and other places not within reach of the
ix>^tal service.
But the little folks are not the onjv ones
who send indefinitely addressed letters.
Two examples will serve to show the rare
discriminating powers assigned to the
postal employe by the public mind:
""Please deliver to a physician who is a
native of either Nova Scotia, New Bruns­
wick or Prince Edward's Island.""
Evidently the area Involved was too wide
and the authorities,pave up the search.
""Forward or give* to a widow, age thirty­
two or over, with cfrark brown hair and
eyes; heipht, five feet two inches; name

Tho following incident was described to
me by a friend who heard it from the lips
of the man who saw it. My friend’s in­
formant, a laboring man. passed on his
way to work every morning a pond on
which were swans. One morning he saw
a swan with its head under water—no
unusual thing, so he thought nothing of
it. The next morning it was in exactly
the same place and position. Still, that
was not remarkable, and he passed on.
ln the third morning, seeing the swan in
precisely the sain*? position, he called the
attention of the keeper to it. The keeper
proceeded to examine, and found that the
swan’s head had been swallowed by a
large pike. Both, of course, were dead.—

has learned something about shoes and
how they should be cared for.
'I do not buy the most expensive
footwear,"" he said, ""because I consider
it to be a waste of money, but a pair of
shoes will last me two years before
they show a sign of break. They have
to be reheeled always and sometimes
half-soled, but the uppers are good gen­
erally when I get tired of them and
throw them away. It is all a matter
of supplying the leather with the oil
that it got from the animal in a nat­
ural way when it was hide and un­
tanned. If you will remember, tan­
nic acid is used on the hide in prepar­
ing it for commerce, and that is very
drying. Instead, leather in which too
much of it has been used can never be
made durable. It cracks and breaks
in a little while. I am talking now of
black shoes. I do not wear tans or
greens. I am not so foolish as that.
""insist always that your bootblack
shnil use a slight quantity of oil when
giving you a shine. Rubbing a little of
it on with a rag will do. It sinks in
readily, and, as it prepares the surface,
you get a better and more lasting shine.
Xo bootblack will do this unless you
tell him, because the bootblack is about
the most trifling human being that
lives. It is his idea always to get
through the world with as little trouble
as possible to him. He has an easy and
lucrative way erf making a living, and
j he eloes not propose to change it in
Hny way unless you make him.
""After the oil and blacking have been
put on, see that fhe final polishing is
done with a piece of canton flannel.
Brushes have a tendency to roughen
the leather, and the cloth works the
oil into ihe shoe more perfectly. A
shine cf this kind obtained from a com­
petent man will last two days, and
icok well at the end of the second
in dry weather. Never all.iw anyone
nf the prepared polishes. They are all
injurious. Three oil shines a week, and

as mine do. It is a big saving in the
course of a year or two."" Chicago

Potatoes Attain a Good Size.
Recently Tom Mallory, of Spokane,
returned from Dawson and to a Chrran­
icle reporter he submitted to an inter­
view upon the agricultural capabilities
of that country.
""It isn't."" he said, ""a very good place
to raise oranges, but some kinds of
farming are all right. Potatoes attain
a good size for table use on Forty-Mile
Creek, and about the old trading post
at Fort Selkirk. It is believed the early
varieties may be cultivated through a
sue-cession of seasons of experimenta­
tion into an early hardy variety that
will mature in the country. Turnips
grow on Forty-Mile and in the vicinity,
attaining to an enormous size.
""The ground is prepared for cultiva­
tion by removing the moss growth and
turning up the soil to a depth of 18 or
20 inches, from which the warm rays of
the sua soon thaw the frost. Hut th
frost extends down an indefinite dis­
tance below this.
""Are there any fruits?""
""Both high and low bush cranberries
grow abundantly in the Klondike re­
gion and throughout the Yukon valley,
so far as explored by whites. They are
extensively used, being for the moft
part supplied by the Indians. Huckle­
berries, currants and red raspberries
also grow in the more sheltered sec­
tions. Strawberries, maturing rapidly
under a hot sun, and being hardy, it is
believed they can be successfully culti­
vated in all the lower valleys of the
Yukon. The strawberry plant is a na­
tive of the country, but only found in
sheltered places. Spokane Chronicle.

T'S only Bessie Ra­
ven,"" said Mrs. Lid­
dington to her
niece, Mrs. Enfield,
a blooming city
matron, who had
brought her two
boys to the country
for the summer, ""I
wouldn't let Hal
and Felix associate
with her on any ac
count, if I were you. There'3 no good
in any of those Ravens a vile, low
set""
Mrs. Enfield looked pityingly at the
brown-faced, bare-legged little gypsy,
who had slunk around the back door,
a basket of late luscious blackberries
on her arm, and the deep flush that be­
tokened how plainly she had over­
beard Mrs. Liddington's careless words,
still dyeing her cheeks.
""Only Bessie Raven!"" How often
she had heard that phrase. How bit­
ter a meaning did it convey to her
ears.
""There are no trout there! You
might throw a bait and wait a year,
and you wouldn't get a bite!""
It was a deep, solitary ravine, where,
in attitudes of intense eagerness, Hal
Enfield and his brother Felix were
holding their fishing rods, awaiting the
expected bite, while Bessie Raven's
brown face and big, black eyes looked
out at them from a natural oval frame
of bushes and vines, as she held a
basket in one hand, and her tattered
sun bonnet in the other.
Hal Enfield, a self-sufficient little
aristocrat, by nature as well as by
education, drew himself haughtily up.
""I don't know that we asked any
Information from you,"" said he,
haughtily. ""Have the goodness to be
about your business.""
""I won't!"" retorted Bessie Raven,
with an ominous flash in her dark
eyes. ""It's a free country, ain't it?
And I've as much right here as you
have!""
""Very well,"" said Hal, rising and
gathering together his tackle. ""I'll
go, then. Come, Felix.""
But Felix, the younger brother, had
no idea of leaving his cool, shady nook,
for a whim of Hal's.
Hal stalked away in high dudgeon;
Felix remained behind to cultivate the
acquaintance of Bessie Raven.
""If there are no trout here,"" said he,
composedly eyeing the brown gypsy
face among the leaves, ""where do they
hide?""
""I'll show you,"" said Bessie, with
alacrity. ""Just a piece further on.
There's lots of 'em only everybody
don't know it. Come on!""
And the two children spent a long
summer's morning together under the
green trees.
Until just as Felix Enfield was turn­
ing to go home, half apprehensive that
he had missed the farm-house dinner,
he did not perceive that the little gold
cross he wore attached to his watch­
chain was gone.
""Oh!"" cried he, ""where is my ""
He stopped abruptly. For in the very
moment In which he spoke, he per­
ceived, half-hidden in the folds of the
bosom of Bessie's tattered dress, the
gleam of some golden ornament. In­
voluntarily he caught at it it was his
own.
""You little thief!"" cried he, ""you
must have stolen it!""
Bessie stood sullen and silent, her
eyes cast down, her bare feet impa­
tiently patting the velvety grass be-

low. She could not deny it she scorn­
ed any attempt to justify herself.
""Bessie,"" said the boy, slowly, ""what
made you do it? Don't you know that
it 5s wrong to steal?""
""Wrong!"" cried out Bessie, passion­
ately. ""Why is it wrong You are rich
and I'm poor! You've got everything,
and I've got nothing! Why shouldn't
I help myself when I've got the
chance?""
Felix Enfield looked at her. Verily
there was more in her creed than he
had realized.
""I'll tell you why. Bessie,"" said he.
""At least. I'll tell you what I think
about it.""
So. in his boyish way. he unfolded
the philosophy of meum and tuum.
Bessie Raven listened in surprise.
She had never been reasoned with be
fore. No one had ever taken the trou­
ble to explain matters and things in
general to her.
""Oh, Felix!"" she cried out, with a
great sob in her throat, ""I see"" it all

Ten years afterward! Three and
twenty is a dangerous age for flirta­
tions, but Felix Enfield had never been
seriously smitten until that time when
he crossed the Atlantic in the steamer
Will o the Wisp, and fell in love with
the captain's Spanish-eyed daughter.
""If you don't marry me,"" said Felix,
with comical ""earnestness, ""I'll throw
myself into the sea.""
""There's not much danger of that,""
said Miss Richfield, quietly.
""But I am in earnest!"" protested
Felix.
""So am I!"" said the damsel with the
blue-black eyes.
""Don't you love me?"" pleaded Felix.
""I don't dislike you,"" demurely an­
swered Miss Richfield.
""Then I shall hope,"" reclared Felix.
""Hope Is a commodity that is free
to all!"" said the young lady.
But at the voyage's end Mr. Enfield
was deeper in love than ever.
""Look here. Miss Richfield."" said he:
""if you don't say you'll have me, I
won't leave the steamer's deck! I'll
go back and forth perpetually between
New York and Southampton!""
""I don't think papa would care for
so permanent a passenger,"" said Miss
Richfield, with a mischievous twinkle
in her eyes.
""But, really! Do you know. Miss
Richfield, I believe you are engaged al­
ready.""She colored a little.
""Why?"" she asked.
""Ah! you think I have no eyes. You
think I haven't perceived that you
always wear a black velvet ribbon
around your neck a black velvet rib­
bon, from which is suspended some
trinket of gold, hidden in the lace
frills of your collar. Is it a gauge?""
""Yes,"" Miss Richfield calmly an­
swered; ""it is a gauge of true love. If
I ever am married ""
""If,"" almost scornfully ejaculated
the lover.
""Well, when I am married,"" Miss
Richfield corrected herself, ""it will
only be to the gentleman who gave
me this!""
""Then I may consider myself reject­
ed?"" slowly spoke Felix, with a face
of the bitterest chagrin.
""Not quite,"" said the dark-eyed dam­
sel, soltfly, as she drew the golden
tailsman from her throat and held it
toward him. ""Don't you remember
who gave me this?""
He uttered an exclamation of recog­
nition.""It is the golden cross I gave, years
ago, to Bessie Raven!"" cried he.
""Yes."" she said, quietly, ""and I am
Bessie Raven.""
""You!""
""Yes. My mother died shortly after
you gave me this. My uncle, who had
just returned from the West, adopted
us all. Two of my sisters are inboarding-school.
My brother is being edu­
cated in a German university. And I
am my uncle's adopted daughter,
known only by his name.""
""But, Bessie, you said you would
marry the one who gave you that!""
cried out Enfield.

ing and blushing, ""if he is still in­
fatuated enough to persist in wanting
me.""

MRS. GLADSTONE AT HOME.

Tmijm'! Trieste to Her Wrlttes
Twenty-Seres Tears Ago.
Mrs. Gladstone recently celebrated
her 86th birthday, and every one wish­
ed her all possible happiness, says the
London Chronicle. She has been a
veritable ""angel in the house"" and her
loving care for her distinguished hus­
band has passed into a proverb. Mrs.
Gladstone's vitality is marvelous and
she preserves as active an interest in
her many philanthropic works as of
old. The eldest daughter of Sir Steph­
en Glynne, Catharine Glynne and her
sister attracted great admiration when
they appeared in London society. When
the Glynnes were on the continent in
1839 they met very frequently Mr. Glad­
stone, who was even then a notable
politician, having already filled the of­
fice of under secretary for the colonies
and also that of vice-president of the
board of trade. Mr. Gladstone's clos­
est friend, Lord Lyttleton, had made as
favorable an impression on the young­
er Miss Glynne as Mr. Gladstone had
made on her eldest sister, with the re­
sult that all fashionable London was
shortly after this visit to Italy inter­
ested to hear of the bethrothal of the
two young politicians to the two love­
ly sisters. The weddings took place
on the same day, July 25, 1839. Mrs.
Gladstone's good works began at a peri­
od when it was not so fashionable as
to-day for gentlewomen to frequent the
slums, intent on ameliorating the con­
dition of the poor. She was especially
busy at the time of a devastating epi­
demic which scourged the east end of
London many years ago, and she was
very frequently a visitor to the London
hospital. Many a poor convalescent
has had reason to bless the name of
Mrs. Gladstone in connection with the
home which bears her name. At Ha­
warden one sees at once how large a
part philanthrophy plays in Mrs. Glad­
stone's beneficent life. There is hei
boys' home close to the castle and not
far from it is the home in which some
old ladies are, thanks to her kindness,
spending the evening of their days in
peace. Tennyson's words will find echo
in many a heart to-day: ""One could
not but feel humbled in the presence
of those whose life was evidently one
long self-sacrifice, and, one would hope,
quickened to more of it in one's own
life. Mrs. Gladstone wears herself out
by all her hospital work in addition
to the woik of a prime misister's wife.'
That tribute was written twenty-seven
years ago, and Mrs. Gladstone is still
abel to enjoy fairly good health in hei
old age.
TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE.
One
Will Ue Seen bv the rrnnle
of
America on 3I.y 28. 1900.
The people of America will have a
very unusual chance to see a total solar
eclipse right here at home on May 28,
1890. Astronomers are even now study­
ing the meteorological tables for past
years in order to find the localities
promising clearest skies, says the
Washington Post. The line of totality
first touches the continent on the Paci­
fic coast in Mexico, north of Cape Co­
rientes, pursuing a northeast course,
leaving Mexico at the mouth of the Rio
Grande, crossing the gulf of Mexico and
entering the United States at Atchafa­
laya bay. Louisiana. The breadth of
the line is about fifty miles. The eclipse
will be total at New Orleans at about
8:22 a. m.. Washington time. The
eclipse will be visible in Macon. Ral­
eigh, Norfolk and intermediate and
neighboring points. Crossing the ocean
the land first touched is near the port
of Coimbra. Spain, passing southeast
across southern Europe and the Medi­
terranean sea. Thus all the astrono­
mers in both hemispheres will be with­
in easy distance and with every facil­
ity for using any amount of instrumen­
tal equipment. The greatest duration
will be two minutes, nine seconds,
about the middle of the Atlantic ocean.

A CURIOUS BET. I
How the Old Woman Dashed a Reck­
, leas Youth's Hope.
Two of the younger members of a
well-known club, both of whom are so
lond of betting that they are willing
to wager money upon almost anything,
became involved in iin argument over
the popularity of mustaches a few days
ligo, says the Philadelphia Record. One
contended that the wearing of the hir­
sute adornment was on the wane; the
other said that more mustaches are
worn now than ever before. The up­
shot of the matter was that the first of­
fered to bet that seven persons without
mustaches (including women, for the
take of making the test more interest­
ing) would pass the club windows be­
fore three with mustaches should go
by. The wager was promptly accept­
ed, a referee was selected and the three
stationed themselves at the point of
Vantage to take observations. The first
four to pass were young women and the
anti-mustache man grew jubilant. His
Jaw fell, however, when the next two
pedestrians, with luxurious growths
upon their lips, hove in sight. Then fol­
lowed two more women, and the watch­
ers waited expectantly. The ninth
pasSer-by was a young man who was
raising a mustache, yet in its infancy.
A warm argument followed oa to the
disposition of this case, but the referee
Bettled the matter by crediting one-half
to each side, making the score 6 to 2.
An old woman was approaching in the
distance, and the man who had Zyt
points began to lose hope, but when
;he arrived opposite the reviewing stand
tt was seen that she had more hair
on her lip than her male predecessor.
The referee decided against the fellow
who had proposed the bet.
A QUEER ""GROUND.""
Discovered by a Lineman While Re­
pairing a Leak,
""Who ever heard of a snake not over
three feet in length grounding a tele­
graph wire and rendering it useless for
two days and as many nights?"" was
the question asked of a number of rail­
road men by a well-known lineman who
has care of the Western Union Tele­
graph company's wires along the line
of one of the greatest trunk systems
in the state of Ohio. ""It was this way:
""During the republican Rational con­
vention at St. Louis, in 1890, when every
wire in the country was needed, and
taxed to its utmost capacity with bul­
letins from the convention, that one of
the through wires from St. Louis to
Cleveland became grounded on my di­
vision, causing me no end of trouble,
and compelling me to go from pole to
pole for two days before locating the
trouble, which, to my astonishment,
was caused by a small snake of greenish
color, and about three feet in length.
One end of fhe snake was lying across
the wire, while the other end was rest­
ing against the lightning rod which
is placed on every fifth pole of a tele­
graph line. The snake when taken off
and examined was found to be nearly
burned in two, caused by the strong
current of the telegraph wire and the
direct ground circuit obtained from the
lightning rod. How the snake came in
this position will always be a mystery,
but no doubt it was thrown there after
being killed by some one walking along
the railway track. '

port of the Court of Inquiry:—
U. S. S. IOWA. 1st Rate,
KEY WEST, Fla.,
Monday, March 21, 1898.
After full and mature consideration of
all the testimony before it, the court finds
as follows:— A , . .
1. That the United States battleship
Maine arrived in the harbor of Havaha,
Cuba, on the twenty-fifth day of January,
1898. and was taken to buoy No. 4. in
from five and one-half to six fathoms of
water, by the regular Government pilot.
The United States Consul General at
Havana had notified the authorities at
that place, the previous evening, of the
intended arrival of the Maine.
2. The state of discipline on board the
Maine was excellent, and all orders and
regulations in regard to the care and
safety of the ship were strictly carried
out. , . ,
All ammunition was stowed in accord­
ance with prescribed instructions, and
proper care was taken whenever ammuni­
tion was handled.
Nothing was stowed in any one of the
magazines or shell rooms which was not
permitted to be stowed there.
The magazines and shell rooms -were
always locked after having been opened,
and after the destruction of the Maine
the keys were found in their proper place
in the Captain’s cabin, everything hav­
ing been reported secure that evening at
forty minutes past nine in the evening.
The temperature of the magazine and
shell rooms were taken daily and re­
ported. The only magazine which had
an undue amount of heat was the after
ten-inch magazine, and that did not ex­
plode at the time the Maine was de­
stroyed. „ J
The torpedo war heads were an stowed
in the after part of the ship under the
ward room and neither caused nor par­
ticipated in the destruction of the
Maine.
The dry gun cotton primers and detona­
tors were stowed in the cabin aft, and
remote from the scene of the explosion.
Waste was carefully looked","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87068097/1898-03-28/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,njr_horseradish_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Jersey City news.,City Pub.

Dr. Adolph Miller, of Philadelphia, presi­
dent of the Pennsjlvania JIcological
Club, in a dissertation on the pepper plant. ,
sajs that during the middle ages in t.uropo
pepper was, the moat esteemed and im­
portant of all the HHces. Genoa, Venice,
and other commercial cities of c'entril
Kuropo were indebted to their traffic in
pepper for a large part of their wealth.
Its importance as .1 means of promot­
ing commercial activity and civilization
during the middle ages can harillv m over­
rated. Tribute was levied in pepper, and
donations were made in this spice, which
was frcciuentlv also utcd as a medium of
exchange In place of monej. When the
Imperial city of Rome was besieged bj
Alaric. the kings of tho Goths In 4 A. I).
the ransom demanded included 5.0O1 pounds
of gold, 30 0CO pounds of River, and 3 0u0
pounds of pepper, illustrating ""the im­
portance of this spice at that time.
So-culled pepper rents, common Murine;
the middle ages, consisted in an obligation
imposed upon a tenant to supply his lord
with a pound of pepper at stated limes,
showing how acceptable was this favorite
condiment and how great n.11 the de-ire
of the wealthier class to setUn- a iet,'ii­
lar supply of it. Spice dealers were known
as pipcrarii: in English. pcpperer. and
in French, poivencrs. As a fraternitj.
or guild, they existed in London in the
reign of Henrv II. 1154-llS:i. Thev were
subsequent! Incorporated into the (iro­
cers' company, and had the control of tho
trade in spices, drugs, dje stuff and met­
als.The price of spice during the middle ages
was alvvavs exorbitant! high, as the
rulers of Egjpt extorted a large revenue
fioi'i all who were engaged in the spite
tr.ioe. The high cost of this important
condiment Incited the Portuguese to seek
for a sea passage to India Some time
after this discovcrj A. D. 1195) there was
a considerable fall in the price of pepper.

A FAMILY FAILING

The straggle yvlth Heredity
The Right Side of the Color Line

To heredity to the transmission of
traits from sire to son we owe most of the
possibilities of growth and development
If each newly born bngr started outanew
without the force of heredity the level
of life might be expected to be that of the
digger Indian or Bushman Naturally bad
traits descend like the good Peculiarities
of feature excentricities of speech and
manner birth marks etc are handed
down just as surely as manual dexterity
physical beauty mathematical ability
and the mentaf and moral qualities in
general A curious example of this de­
scent of family traits is furnished by Mrs
Maggie Pickett Canton Ga in whose
family gray hair was hereditary She
writes
Gray hair is hereditary in our family
As long as I can recollectmy mothers hair
has been gray About twelve years ago
my hair began to show signs of turning
I resolved to try Ayers Hair Vigor and
after using it only a few times my hair
was restored to its natural color St still
usethis dressing occasionally a bottle
lasting me quite a while and though over
forty years of age my hair retains its
youthful color and fullness To all who

""Preliminary report from board ordered

The department has already arranged with
the Merritt-Chapman Wrecking Company
to undertake the salvage of these vessels,
and two of the vessels of that company are

The Deutsche Zeitung, San Paolo,
Brazil, gives some shameful particu­
lars of the ""spoils"" system as it pre­
vails in that country. One story,
translated in the Literary Digest,
has an amusing side.
Some time ago a general was sent
to one of the northern states to inves­
tigate the management of a govern­
ment railroad. lie belonged to the
set of men who have made them­
selves obnoxious by their endeavors
in the service of reform, and here are
some of his experiences:
The very first da) he found in one
of the rooms of a railroad station a
strong young man who was doing
nothing. Thinking the young fel­
low had come to see him, he asked:
"" Do you wish anything, my
friend? ""
""No, sir. 1 am employed here.""
""So! What are your duties?""
""I have to fill the water-jugs in

the office every flay.""
The general was a little astonish­
ed. In the next room he discovered
another able - bodied young man
smoking a cigarette. ""Are you an
employe?"" he asked.
""\ es, sir. 1 am the assistant of
the gentleman in (he next room.""
But that was nothing to what was
to come. The general had already
been informed that the road employed
eighteen engineers, while only eight
were working. He ordered that in
future these men should at least take
turn about. The next da) - one of
these ""engineers,"" a beardless youth,
came to him and told hint that he
could not run a locomotive to save
his life.
""Then how did you get on tin
pay-roll? ""
""Well, you see, general, it's this
way. My family are poor, but I
wanted to study law. We've got
some pull, so I managed to get an
appointment as honorary engineer,
to make a living while I pursue my
studies ""

To the sounds and sights of sorrow

This side of Sandy Hook!
Your eye is searching the distance.
You are holdins your torch too high

Though close at your feet they lie.
And the cry of the suffering stranger
Has reached your ear and yotir breast.
But you do not heed the wail

That comes from the haunts of your own
oppressed.

Follow me where I lead
Come down into the sweat-shop

And look on the work of greed!
Look on the faces of children,
Old before they were born!
Look on the haggard women.

Of all sex-graces shorn!
Look up on the men—God help us!
If this is what it means
To be men in the Land of Freedom

And live like mere machines!

Goddess of Liberty, answer!
How can the slaves of Spain
Find freedom under your banner,

While your own still wear the chain
Loud is the screech of your eagle
And boastful the voice of your drums,
But they do not silence the wail of despair,

That rises out of your slums.
What will you do with your conquests,
And how shall your hosts be fed,
While your streets are filled with desperate
throngs,

litical atmosphere is surcharged with dan­
gerous electricity, generated by the Drey­
fus affair, the General, who has just
quitted the Cabinet, defying civil author­
ity. takes, without consulting his suc­
cessor or the Premier, an important step.
In ordinary circumstances, the Military
Governor is' empowered to act independ­
ently, but, now that the Dreyfus question
has become a great national matter, every
proceeding in the Affair has State im­
portance.
General Zurlinden’s ignoring this obvi­
ous fact is very significant. He cornea
forward as the defender of the army, the
prosecutor of its supposed calumuiators
and the resolute opponent of a revision of
the case. From this to an appeal to the
public in the line of the establishment
of a dictatorship there is no wide step.
The “Sole!!” says that owing to yes­
terday's events, the Cabinet, at an infor­
mal conference, discussed General Zurlin­
den’s action, and the “Fronde” even as­
serts that the Premier, ‘M. Brisson, disa­
vows the measures taken against Pic­
quart. which, he adds, were instituted
without the knowledge of the Cabinet.
The “Radical” makes a bitter attack on
the General Staff, which it charges with
aiming at the moral assassination of Pic­
quart through a secret military trial.
Henri Rochefort, in his paper, the *‘In­
transigeant,” declares Picquart -B-a* , *

DriDeci oy a syndicate or oy uermauy to
save Dreyfus.
Jaures, the Socialist Deputy, in tho
“Petite Republique,” ^maintains that the
General Staff of the French Army can­
not now escape the full light of a revision
of the Dreyfus case.
Picquart was transferred this afternoon
to the Military Prison of Cherche Midi.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87068097/1898-09-22/ed-1/seq-1,"","",1,"","",1,njr_horseradish_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Jersey City news.,City Pub.

Denver, Col., Sept. 28. Dispatches re­
ceived here indicate that great fires are
devastating the timber growth on the
main range. From Hahn's peak on the
north to Pagosa springs on the south, a
distance of hundreds of miles, the flames
are doing their destructive work uncheck­

FIRES BREAK OUT AGAIN.
Snow in Colorado Only Checked Them
Temporarily.
Marble, Colo., Oct. 10 The big forest
fires are gaining momentum again, the
fall of a snow a week ago in the Elk
mountain range having proved only a
temporary check. The cattle herds are
being removed from the Muddy mead­
ows, as prairie fires are sweeping them.
The intermountains country is ablaze
in several places, one of the heaviest
of fires devastating the country between
Slate and East rivers and the Pittsburg
breakers, and the town of Gothic ia
again threatened.
A big blaze has been started on
Bellevue mountain, on the Maroon trail
of East Rocky creek. From the West
Elk mountains come reports of a nar­
row escape of a party of crystal pros­
pectors who had to move camp three
times in one night.
Great clouds of dense black and
white smoke hang over the valley bj
day. and at night the heavens are
mirroring red, ominous looking glares.

A veteran cavalry horse uirtakes of .
the hopes and fears of battle just the 1

8ame a8 nis nuer. as me column
swings into .line and waits, the horse
grows nervous over the waiting. If the
wait is spun out he M ill tremble and
sweat and grow apprehensive. If he
has been six mouths in service, he
knows every bugle call. As tbe call
conies to advance the rider can feel him
working at the bit with his tongue to
get it tietween his teeth. As he moves
out he will either seek to get on faster
than he should or bolt, lie cannot
bolt, however. The lines M-ill carry
him forward and after a minute he will
grip, lay back his ears, and one can feel
his sudden resolve to brave the worst
and have done with it as soon as pos­
sible.A man seldom cries out m hen hit in
the turmoil of battle. It is the same
M ith a horse. Five troopers out of six
when struck with a bullet are out of
their saddles within a minute. If hit
iu the breast Or shoulder up go their
hands and they get a heavy fall ; if in
the leg, or foot, or arm, they fall for­
ward and roll off. Kven with a foot
cut off by a jabbed piece of shell a horse
will not drop. It is only when shot
through the head or heart that he
comes down. He may be fatally
wounded, but hobbles out of the fight
to right or left and stands with droop-
i iug head until loss of blood brings him
down. The horse that loses nis riuer
and is unwounded himself will con
tinue to ran with his set of fours until
some movement throws him out.

will not leave the field. In his racing

or four other riderless steeds they fall in
and keep together, as if for mutual pro­
tection, and the ""rally"" on the bugle

PARIS, Oct. 31, im—The American
Peace Commissioners, each carrying
portfolio containing records and persona!
memoranda, left their headquarters in the
Continental Hotel for the meeting with
the Spanish Commissioners, at the For­
eign Office, shortly before two o’clock this
afternoon.
The President of the Spanish Commis­
sion, Senor Montero Rios, whose health
at one time was so precarious as to
threaten an indefinite adjournment of the
sessions of the Commissions, had improv­
ed to the extent of enabling him to attend
today’s rrieeting, He arrived at the For­
eign Office in a closed carriage, with his
colleagues, shortly after the Americans
reached the meeting place.
Shortly after two o'clock the ten Com­
missioners confronted each other across
the table on which, in 1783, Benjamin
Franklin and his collekgues signed the
Treaty of Independence of the United
States. Outside, the carriages of the two
Commissions were drawn up on the
gravelled drive, awaiting the pleasure ol
the Commissioners. The day was bleak,
with flying clouds, fitful sunshine, whirl­
ing leaves and raw air.
The American Commissioners presented
a written expression of the purpose of
the United States to take the entire group
of Philippine Islands, and to assume such
proportion of the Philippine debt as has
been spent for the benefit of the islands
or their inhabitants, in public works, im­
provements and permanent betterments.
It was also set forth that the United
States would not assume any Dart of me
Philippine debt which has ben incurred by
Spain for the furtherance of military or
naval operations to quell insurrections of
the natives.
The session was eventually adjourned
until Friday, in order to give the Span­
iards time to prepare a reply. The ses­
sion, today, lasted a litlte over an hour.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87068097/1898-10-31/ed-1/seq-8,"","",8,"","",1,njr_horseradish_ver02,"","","",true,ca,The Jersey City news.,City Pub.

LONDON, Nov. 7.—The Madrid cor­
respondent of the Daily Mail sayg:
""Spain will sign the treaty of peace
under protest.""
The Berlin correspondent of the
Times, after giving extracts from a
long and violent article In the Kol­
nische Zeitung, declaring that the fate
of the Philippines cannot be a matter
of indifference to Germany, expresses
the opinion that such utterances will
only stiffen the attitude of the United
States.
The ""Vienna correspondent of the
Times, commenting upon the irritation
of the German press over the attitude
of the United States towards the Phil­
ippine question, says: ""It has but little
importance and is only likely to excite
the scorn and defiance of the Amer­
icans and tend to confirm them in their
decision to retain the Philippines. The
Fremdenblatt, in a temperate tone that
gives the German papers an example
of impartiality, recognizes that it is
surely a question for the Americans to
decide for themselves.""
The Berlin correspondent of the
Standard says: ""The semi-official pa­
pers have received a hint to stop their
attacks upon Americans. I have good
reason to believe, however, that Ger­
many will doff her reserve so soon as
the powers seek a share of the spoil
in the Philippines.""

A go Stil I Use.

The mica mines of India are in the
interior of the country and very inaccess­
ible. The Abraker mine, it is stated,
produces the finest mica that has ever
been mined, both for lamination and
color. It has been sunk about 200 feet,
following the pitch of the vein, and all
this mica and refuse have been rai&cJ
and carried away by the natives. No
machinery of any kind except drill and
hammers is used in their mining opera
tions.

The refuse and the mica are placed
in baskets each holding ten pounds, the
baskets being passed up from hand to
hand by women, who stand in a line on
ladders. The contents of the baskets are
deposited at the top, and the baskets are
returned down the ladder in the same
manner as they went up, but by anoth­
er line of women. Water is taken out
of the mines by means of jugs It is
supposed that this method of operation
has been carried on for many hundreds
of years, except that there is more care
to protect the miners.

After the crude mica is taken from
the mines it is first roughly trimmed
and then sorted into different grades,
according to sizes and quality. It is
then taken to the mica workers, who
split ic up and scribe out the size for it
to be cut into by the shearers, the cut
pieces then being cleaned, weighed and
packed ready for shipment. -The mica
is then transported to general ware­
houses in baskets on the backs of bul­
locks and bullock carts In this way
it is carried hundreds of miles to ship­
ping points at a speed of about ten
miles a day

The mica can be split down to .0003
of -an inch in thickness. Being both
fireproof and transparent, it is very use­
ful for many purposes in the arts, be­
sides being an excellent insulator.—

COLOR BLIND PAINTERS.

A on O is A at re
A re S A is

To speak of a color blind artist sounds
like joking, said a noted oculist but,
strange as it seems, there are Eeveral
persons so affected who can nevertheless
paint extremely well. Numbers of color
blind people there are, of course, who
draw perfectly in pencil, ink and cray­
ons, but I myself know a scene painter
attached to a provincial theater who,
though ""color blind,"" paints all its
scenery, and has quite a local name,
not only for his ""interiors"" and oak
chambers, but even for landscapes.

I can tell you also of two London la­
dies who consulted me for color blind­
ness who paint really beautiful pictures.
One is the daughter of a late famous
artist and was taught painting by her
father. She is quite unable to distin­
guish red from green, but her colors are
all labeled with the names, and she
has been taught which to use for cer­
tain effects. Possibly her painting may
seem to her eyes, as it were, drawing
with a brush and ""shading"" 'with the
colors.

The other is a lady artist of some
celebrity, who has for years exhibited
annually in London. The public is not
aware that she is color blind. She
painted the ""Wedding Group"" for a
certain noble bridegroom a year or two
ago and also several public men's por­
traits and one of an eminent physician
fetched 500 guineas.

There is a gentleman residing at
Kensington who, having years ago left
the navy through finding his advance­
ment hopelessly barred by his color
blindness, is at present making several
hundreds a year by his brush as an
artist, designing most artistic and
brightly colored picture posters for ad­
vertisement hoardings. London An­

""John Harmon died here from the
bite of a rattlesnake.""
This is an inscription on a beech tree
standing on the knobs, in Monroe town­
ship, back of Jeffersonvilie. A date
once followed the words, but it is now
indistinct. There is a strange story con­
nected with the inscription An old
resident relates it
""Years ago, when that section of In­
diana was little explored and when
the heavy bush was the dwelling place
of the wild turkey, deer and rattlesnake,
John Harmon started to Oharlestown
to attend court. He was armed with an
old fashioned rifle. A rattler bit Har­
mdh's leg. Harmon killed the reptile.
Then he began to prepare for death. It
•was he -who carved the words in lighter
lines on the tree, with the request be­
neath, long since obliterated by the
tree's growth, to bury him on the spot.
A few days later Harmon's body was
found. A grave was dug by the tree and
there it can be seen today.""—Louisville

was ""a greater burden to n man's hand than
relief to his head."" Later than lhls. In Addi­

century he was sure to bo greeted with clbcs.
cries of ""Frenchy. don't you want a coach?""
and the like. The first man who dared openly
to meet this storm of ridicule Is said to hare
been tho famous philanthropist Jonas Hanway,
who was born In 1712. Ho had a great deal of
fan poked at him, but he continued to carry
his umbrella whenever it rained, and others
soon had tbo courage to follow his example. At
the time of his death. In 1781, all England was
carrying umbrellas.
Montaigne's objection to tho weight of um­
brellas was, In his time ani.for two centuries
afterward, quite a justifiable one. It was a
small umbrolla then which weighed threo and
a half pounds. Instead of tho thin, rain-proof
fabrics which now form tho covering of um­
brellas, nothing better was known thnn leather
or oilcloth. Tho ribs"" wore of wood or of whale­
bone, and such a thing as n steel rod was. of
course, unknown. Tho Btlck was usually .of

ncavy oaic. Many umbrellas had the additional
incumbrance of feathers over tho top. oh tho
theory of ""shedding water off n duck's back.""
But tho ollclothiand leather urn brollas. notwl th­
xatandlnc tho feathers, wero apt to leak.
Properly speaking, there are no such things
as ""umbrolla factories."" Tho umbrella
maker puts the parts of the umbrelln togeth­
er. Only that. It has not. boon many years
since almost everything used In making an
umbrella camo from tho Old World. The
stoel rod. which by processes discovered nbout
three years ago was made possible for tho
cheaper as well as tho hlgh-prlcod umbrellas,
was up to that time always an Imported arti­
cle. Two years ago It. began to bo extensive­
ly manufactured in America, and. like tho
other component parts of tho umbrella, is
now sold In this country In better qualltv
and at lower prion thnn it can be obtained
across the sea. The factories which mako
umbrella steel rods make tho rods and uoth­
Ing else. The manufacturing of umbrella
steel frames Is nn entirely separate industry.
There are four larco steel frame, factories In
, America. It was a great discovery when
steel frame manufacturer found that hollow
steel ribs were just as good as solid ones.
As tho smallest umbrella has nt least seven
1 ribs, this discovery lessened tho weight of
I umbrellas very materially. Tho common para­
gon frame has eight ribs. Some umbrellas,
tho kind that nro called ""family umbrellas.""
nnd are good to go fishing with, have as many
ns sixteen ribs. It Is not quite firty rears
since the paragon frame was Invented. It
was patented by Samuel Fox. nn English­
man, in 18.12. and has had moro to do with
imparting strength, lightness and elasticity to ,
the umnrclla than nnvthlng elso. I
A booli could bo written about the various
mateilals from which umbrella handles nro
made. The partridge, rr lorle. as It Is called
in Franeo. Is ono of the best natural woods. It
1 comes from n tree of Africa, nuu Is bard on tho
outside nnd soft on the Inside. Tlio Arabian
vino isa beautiful, extremely hard wood. An­
other is the Welchsel. ""When n voting lady
comes In and eavs sho wants an umbrella han­
dlo that smells llko Ice cream,"" said Mr. louls
Onimus. a South Brondway umbrella mnker.
I Immediately know that sho wants a Welch­
sel."" Congo Pieces are distinguished for tlio
natural wood knots, which occur at exactly
regular intervals. Tho Malaga is a shining,
straight, smooth stick, susceptible of a very
high polish. Bamboo is used a greUrical. aud
nlso rattan. Ebony, pearl, rosewood, silver.
Dresden chlna.psarl and iv-iry are some of th o
p pnlar materials for high-priced umbrolla
handles.
Solid gold handles are never found In tho or­
dinary umbrella or jewelry store, nnd are made
only when specially ordered. Mr. Nat. Sebas­
tian owns a solid gold handle, which be now
has on a cane, that cost t,r00. Ho takes great
prldo In his rnre possession, nnd has won ,
enough bets on It to moro than pay for tho cost
of the cano. On one occasion, in n largo um- I

of S20U with tho proprietor that there was no

umureua nanuie in tne establishment cqunl In

the umbrella dealor was $200 poorer. Tho
enno which matches this haudlo Is of thin
transvorso sections of horn. In all colors, laid
on top of one another around a steel rod.

'Hie umbrella Is of very ancient origin. It
is found In designs on.uieek and'Etruscan
vases, and is traced back to ancient Eeypt. tbo
mother of arts. Its first use was ufuloubtedlv­
to protect from the burning rnys of tho tropical
sun: its Latin derivation Is trout umbra, a
shade. A curious statement about this is
made by an early Italian writer, ""I du not
think much of umbrellas,"" he guys: ""11 phy­
sician told mo they were dangerous, because
they gathered thelhent In n pyramid and thence
threw it down on the head."" 1 There wereuu­
perstitlons that the umbrella was sacred In nil
the Oriental countries. The early Christian
church, just as It made Bt. Valentine's Day
out of a former heathen festival, began also tu
transmute this reverence for umbrellas Into
something in keeping with Christianity, in
a manuscript left In a monastery ages ago, tbo
margin Is Illuminated with strango designs of
umbrollit-like trees, suggestive nt the same
time of the cross or ""tree ' on which our Ird
was cruollled, and the umbrella of tho Orient.
Ijvter. In the twelfth century, tho Pope mr­
milled the Doge of Venice, In bis state pro­
cessions, to have suspended over him a gor­
geous umbrelln of gold brocade, at tho sum­
mit of which was u small gold fctattto of the
Aniiuuclstlon.

That Amount.
Paris, Nov. 25. It is now known that
Spain will exhaust her time limit, which
expires on Monday, before replying- to
the American offer regarding the Phil­
ippine islands. In the meanwhile the
Spaniards are canvassing the entire
field and exhausting every resource to
postpone the inevitable.
As cabled, to the Associated Press on
Wednesday they could not accept the
American ultimatum as final without
asking if it were really so. That applied
to the time limit. Now the Spaniards
apparently doubt the fixedness of the
amount the Americans offered for the
Philippines and today they sent a com­
munication to the American commis­
sioners asking if the latter would accept
a counter proposal by Spain to cede the
Philippines for $100,000,000. Spain
imagines the Americans might be wil­
ling to lop off the great island of Min­
danao from the Philippines and pay
$50,000,030 for what would remain, in­
stead of $20,000,000 now offered for the
entire archipelago. Spain will learn in
response to such inquiry that Ameri­
cans employ the world ultimatum to
signify ultimate conditions.
However, strenuously Spain may seek
to increase her money advantage for
the cession of the Philippines, she will
finally be compelled to know that the
United States offer means $20,000,000, no
more no less, and that the whole archi­
pelago must pass to the United States
for that sum.
Spain before giving up or turning
away will also propo.se- some alterna­
tive bargain of the Carolines, or the
Canary islands to be held in the pos­
session of the United States, in addi­
tion to the Philippine islands, cn condi­
tion that .Spain be permitted to retain
her sovereignty in the Philippines. In
other words Spain would cede certain
territory in the Carolines and Canaries
and the control of the Philippines oy
the United States under a nominal
Spanish sovereignty and as a further
inducement, propose that the United
States shall pay Spain no money on ac­
count of the Philippine islands.

Queer Heliefn About Seven.
So numerous are the queer beliefs con­
j reining the number seven that a narration
of them all would fill a volume, but we
; may mention a few of them. From the
? \ery earliest ages the seven great planets
| were known and ruled this world and the
? dwellers in it. and their number entered
; into every conceivable matter that con­
cerned man. There are seven days in the
week, ""seven holes in the head for the
master stars are seven."" seven ages both
for man and the world in which he lives.
There were seven material heavens, and in
the underworld described by Dante the
! great pagan dead who were not good
? nough for hcavtn or bad enough for hell
reposed in a seven-walled and seven-gated
city. There are seven colors in the spec­
trum and seven notes in the diatonic oc­
tave. and the ""leading"" note of the scale
is the seventh. Be it noted that the sev­
1 enth son is not always gifted with benefl­
1 ????!*t powers. In Portugal he is believed to
! be subject to the powers of darkness and
to be compelled every Saturday evening to
i ssume the likeness of an ass.","","",https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1898-11-26/ed-1/seq-14,"","",14,"","",1,dlc_ibizanhound_ver01,"","","",true,ca,Evening star.,W.D.

This recommendation was made in the be­
lief that such provisions of law would in­
sure to a greater degree the .safety of the
present standard, and better protect our
currency from the dangers to which it is
subjected from a disturbance in the gen­
eral business conditions of the country.
In my Judgment, the present condition of
the Treasury amply justifies the immediate
enactment of the legislation recommended
one year ago. under which a portion of the
gold holdings should be placed in a trust
fund from which greenbacks should be re­
deemed upon presentation, but when once
redeemed should not thereafter be paid out
except for gold.
It is not to be inferred that other legisla­
tion relating to our currency is not re­
quired; on the contrary, there is an obvious
demand for it.
The Importance of adequate provision
which will Insure to our future a money
standard related as our money standard
now Is to that of our commercial rivals is
generally recognized.
The companion proposition that our do­
mestic paper currency shall be kept safe
and yet be so related to the needs of our
industries and internal commerce as to be
adequate and responsive to such needs Is a
proposition scarcely leas Important. The
subject. In all its parts, is commended to
the wise consideration of the Congress.

so thin, even, so slight, that I fear, in fix­
ing it on paper with written words, to rob
it of its frail grace. Its light savor. Why.
then, when it was related to us one
evening, in all the complicated and dec­
orated luxury of modern talk, by the
charming woman who was the heroine of
the episode why did it make such a te­
nacious impression upon us all that It has
become, in one little corner of Parisian
life, one of those classic talcs, patrimony
of each group of society, to which allu­
sion is always understood and welcomed?
""Perhaps because It was a clear gap in the
chatter of infidelity, in the hackneyed
gossip of politics and literature. Per­
haps because, as an attitude, a gesture at
times may suffice to reveal to us a whole
feminine body beneath its clothing at
times it also needs but a few sincere
words uttered by a woman to disvobe her
soul completely.
We had been talking of mysterious so­
licitations, today classed and named by
science, from which so few of us are ex­
empt, which Invincibly compel some to
add up the flowers of a wall paper, the
volumes of a library, everything that is
additional undei their eyes; others to Im­
pose upon themselves the task, walking
along the side path of a street, to reach
such a gas jet before the cab rolling up
behind them is abreast of them, or a pub­
lic clock has struck Its las: note; and
ethers, again, each night before going to
bed. to practice strange habits in dispon­
ing of objects, visiting cupboards and cof­
fers. ""We discussed all the light diseases
of our contemporary brains, crumbs of
monomania and madness transmitted by
inheritance after inheritance, and finally
dispersed throughout the whole of our
worn humanity. And we all confessed
our weakness, the absurdities of our ma­
nias, reassured by the confession of the
others, delighted to find them like our­
selves, worse even than ourselves.
A young woman had said nothing. She
listened to us, a touch of surprise on hr
peaceful, pretty visage, which was fram­
ed by even, black coils.
Somebody asked her: ""And you. mad­
am, are you quite free of our modern
manias? Have you not a single little ner­
vous habit to confess?""
She appeared to search her memory In
all sincerity: She made a sign with her
head: ""No, no."" We felt that she spoke
the truth, so much did all that we saw
and knew- of her, her restful bearing, her
renown as an unblemished wife, lift hr
above the fashionable dolls who had just
been confessing the 'unsettled state of
their systems.
Doubtlcs her modesty feared the boast
of so complete an indemnity when every­
one around frer had acknowledged all
sorts of little troubles. She corrected
herself:
""Good heavens! T can't say that I
habitually add up the cab numbers, or

mat i m.iKp an inventory of all by drcs­
e before going to bed. Still, the othe­
day T experienced something that suffi­
ciently resembles what you have been de­
scribing, if I have understood j""ou right a
kind of Interior impulsion, a force wh'ch
compels you to accomplish an indifferent
act on the spot, as If it were a matter of

life or death.""
We insisted on hearing the story, and
she told it most graciously, with the air
of begging pardon for the claim on th?
attention of others by so slight an adven­
ture.""In two words this is what happened to
me. Five or six days ago I had gone out
with my little girl Suzon you know her.
she Is S I was taking her to her clavi,
for this big girl already follows classes.
As it was very fine we had decided on
going on foot by the Champs Blysees
and the boulevards from my ihome to the
Rue laifit-te. And so we were walking
along quite gay, chattering together,
when at the top of the Round Point a
lamo man, rather young, limped up to u-
holding out his hand without saying any­
thing. I carried by parasol in my right
hand; with my left hand I held up my
skirts; I confess T had not the patience to
stop and hunt for my puro. I went on
and gave nothing to the baggar.
""Suzon and I contnued to walk along
the Champs Elysccs. The little one had
suddenl ceased to talk, and I also, with­
out quite knowing why. no longer felt any
wish to talk. We were at the Place do la
Concorde, and yet we had neither of us
opened our lips since we had passed tiif
teggar. And little by little I felt btlr and
increase a kind of disquietude, and un­
easiness, the feeling of having accom­
plished an irreparablo action, of bcinc

vague peril in tho future. Tij. general. I
strive to see clearly within myself, .is
far as possible. And thus, all in walk­
ing, I began to examine my conscience.
"" 'Let us see. said T to myelf. 'have
I tinned very grievously agnin-t
charity in giving nothing to that beggar""
I never pretend to regard It as my duty
""o give to every beggar I meet. I will b
more generous with the nt, that is all.""
""But all my arguments did not succeed
in convincing mo, and my inward discon­
tent increased became a sort of anguish,
so that ten times I felt a wish to turn
back to the spot where we had met that
man. Will you believe it? It was a fals
sentiment of human repect that withheld
me from doing so in the presence of my
littlo daughter. Wo are really worth
nothing morethe moment we act in view
of the judgment of others.
""Wc had nearly come to the end of our
walk and were going to turn the corner
of the Rue Tafitte when Suzon pulled
gently at my dresss to stop me.
"" Mamma!' she crid.
"" 'What do you want, darling""
""She fixed her great blue eyes on me
and said gravely:
"" 'Mamma, why did you give nothing to
that poor man In the Champs Klysees?'

in the Hoar resolution to supply the
Senate with the instructions given the
American peace commissioners. If any
reasons an* given for the declination

Percy Cliarrington was carried home '
on a hurdle with his neck broken one
stormy afternoon in mid-Novomber,
having lost those who stopped to proffer
assistance the bent rim ot the season.
People shook their heads and remark
ed that yonng men from the grass coun
ties who will try to fly the Essex fences
can only expect broken necks as a mat­
ter of course. A fence that begins with
a small ditch and a soft take off, con­
tinues with a big built up bunk crown­
ed by a stout staked hazel hedge and is
concluded by a nine foot drop into a
chasm like a ready made grave on the
far side is not the place to fly, as any
fool should have known and all Essex
people do know.
So Percy Charrington went home on
a hurdle all of hiin that the 6tartled
soul left behind when it set forth on its
separate journey from the bottom of
that pitiless ditch, and Mrs. Charring
ton, five days later, sat in her widow s
weeds in the lonely library and gazed
across the sodden, gray garden with
eyes that looked and saw not.
She had been a prisoner and now the
shackles had fallen, and behold, she was
free !
Two hours before the heavy Essex
clay fell dead and solemnly upon her
husband's coffin ; two hours ago she
turned her face from the past and faced
the future the future that five days
back had nt?ver existed for her. Where­
fore she sat in her library and was
calmly, steadfastly glad.
In having been wretched for three
years she was spared the great misery
she should rightly have felt at her lone­
liness. At moments such as these it is
permitted one to bo thankful that all
women do not love their husbands.
Mary Charrington was a small wom­
an, with a slight figure, a pale face a
little too long for its width, big gray
eyes and a muss of old fushioned nut
brown hair. She was four and twenty,
and she had never been sincerely happy
in the whole of her life.
Who are we to cast a stone at her
wThen we realize that she came nearer
to happiness on the day of her hus­
band's funeral than ever before?
It is sinful to wish a man dead, sin­
ful to be glad when he dies, but when
that man's person has constituted a
barrier between oneself and all pleasure
in life, if it bo sinful to rejoice at that
barrier's removing, then sin such re­
joicing must be, and there's an end of
itl
She had married him three years be­
fore for a diversity of reasons, not for
the only one. Kho put all thought of
that aside. She said ""Yes"" to Mr.
Charrington because he was yonng and
good looking and loved her und pro­
posed to her. and because eho was lonely
and poor and tired of all her surround­
ings aud wanted a strong arm between
her and the world. Women marry for
that last reason much ol'tener than they
have any idea of.
Of course directly sho was married
she met the man she was to love, and
forthwith loved him, and suffered as
only these little, palo faced, gray eyed
women can. because- they have no
strength to riso superior to their love,
nor pride of passion ever to contemplate
cutting the Gordian marriage knot.
The Hum's name was Jack Collingwood,
and ho was n barrister, who, being a
brave man. ran away and went otr to
try his luck at the Calcutta bar.
Fate was kind and let him succeed.
Fate wanted to keep him away from
Mrs. Charrington, and then one day
it forgot and lot Percy come to irreme­
diable grief out hunting after which,
having committed a blunder, it washed
its hands of the whole affair and said,
""What must bo shall bol""
Fate is a fatalist.
She wrote to her lover; she told him
she was free. It was not a long letter,
but the whole of her life and her love
and her hopes of heaven went out to
Calcutta between two pages of foreign
paper.

Denver Evening Post.
The Flower of Death
t A Night of Wild Despair and Its Joyful
Morning
YOU are as good as dead,"" said the
doctor, looking steadily at Ana-
tole.
Anatole staggered, lie had come to
pass a cheerful evening with his old
friend, Dr. I'ardais, the savant whose
-works in poisonous substances are so
-well and favorably known, but one
whose excellence of heart and almost
-fatherly kindness Anatole had been
able to appreciate more than any-one.
.And now all of a sudden, without re
jjard for his feelings, without being
prepared to hear it, the terrible prog­
nostic is uttered by so great an author
ity.
""Unfortunate fellow,"" continued the
doctor, ""what have you done?""
""Nothing that I know of,"" stain
mered Anatole, greatly troubled.
""Try to recollect. Tell me what you
""have drank, what you have eaten, and
-what you have breathed.
The last word spoken by the doctor
-was a ray of light to Anatole. That
-very morning he had received a letter
from one of his friends who was trav-
lincr in India. In this letter had
been a flower plucked on the shores
.of the Ganges by the traveler a flow­
er, red, warped, and of bizarre shape,
-the odor of which, he remembered well
now, had seemed to him strangely pene
trating. Anatole searched in his pock
etbook and took therefrom the letter
-and flower in question, which he showed
-to the savant.
""Without doubt,"" exclaimed thedoc--tor,
""it is the Pyramenensis Indica
-the fatal flower, the flower of death.""
""Do you really think so?""
""I am sure of it.""
' ""But it is not possible. I am only 25
-years old. I feel myself full of life and
.health.""
""When did you open that fatal let­
ter?""""At nine o'clock this morning.""
""Well, to-morrow morning, at the
rsame hour, indeed at the same moment,
you will feel a sharp anguish at the
.heart, and it will be all over with you.""
""And do you not know any remedy,
iny means of ""
""None,"" said the doctor, and, hiding
;his face in his hands, he sank back­
ward in his armchair, choked with
.grief.
From the emotion displayed by his
o friend, Anatole realized that there
-was no hope. He departed in a dazed
.manner.
With beads of cold perspiration en
""his brow and his thoughts confused,
.Anatole moved along unconscious of
what was passing around him, and not
-even suspecting that the streets were
becoming deserted. He wandered a
long time thus; but at length, coming
-to a bench, he sat down.
The rest did him good. Until then
he had been like a man who has been
struck on the head with a club. The
-effects of the shock were disappearing,
and he began now to collect his va­
grant thoughts.
""My plight,"" thought he, ""is that of
a person condemned to death. Yet I
can still hope for mercy. By the way,
how much longer have I to live?""
He looked at his watch.
""It lacks three hours of morning. It
-Is time I was in bed. I go to bed, in­
Ideed! To devote the last sad hours
of my life to sleep! No. I can certainly
do better than that. But, what? Far­
bleu! I have it. I will draw up my last
-will aDd testament.""
A restaurant which remained open all
night was near by. Anatole entered
And sat down.
""Waiter, a bottle of champagne and
a bottle of ink.""
He drank a glass and looked at his
writing paper, reflecting: ""To whom
.shall I leave my 6,000 francs income?
I have neither father nor mothera
riact which is lucky for them. And

among the persons who interest me I

can only think of one Nicette.
Nicette was one of his forty-second
cousins, a charming young girl of 18
years, with fair tresses and large, black
eyes. Like himself she was an orphan,
and this community of fate had long
ago established a bond of sympathy be
tween them. His will was speedily
drawn up. "" He left everything to
Nicette.""
tTl a -a .
men was nnisnea ne drank a
second glass of champagne.
""Poor Nicette,"" thought he. ""Her
guardian, who knows little of the world
except his class, which he teaches to
play on brass instruments at the Con
servatory, has bethought himself to
promise her hand to a brute, a sort of
bully, whom she detests, because she
loves another, as she has avowed to me,
although with reticence and an em
barrassed air. Who is this happy mor
tal? But he must be worthy of her,
since she has fixed her affection on
him. Good, gentle, comely and affec
tionate Nicette deserves an ideal hus
band. Ah. how well would she have
suited nie for a wife. It is an infamous
tyranny to spoil her life by giving her
to a brute. But why should I not be
Nicette's champion? I have said it
now, and to-morrow morning I will be-
gin to act. But to-morrow morning it
will be too late. Now is the time to be
gin, if at all. The hour is a little mal
a propos to see people, but as I shall
be dead in five hours I don't care a
sou for conventionalities. Yes, 111 do
it my life for Nicette.""
It v.-as four o'clock in the morning
when Anatole rang the bell at the
house of Nicette's guardian, M. Bou
sard. lindlv frightened and weannjr
his nightcap, he answered the door.
""Is the house on fire?""
""No, my dear M. Bousard,"" replied
Anatole, ""I have come for a chat.""
""At this hour?""
""I am at all hours pleased to see you""
but you are not dressed, M. Bousard
Are vou sroing back to bed again?""
""That's what I am going to do. But
I suppose, monsieur, that to disturb
me in this manner vou must have some
thing very important to say to me.'
""Very important, M. Bousard. It is
necessary that you give up your plan
of marrvinar my cousin Nicette to M
Capendac.""
""Never, monsieur, never.""
""But I say, yes.""
""Monsieur, mv resolution 13 taken
The marriage will take place.""
""It will not.""
""We'll see about that. And now that
you are acquainted with my answer,
I will detain you no longer.""
""That is not altogether polite. But
I am as good-nature.! as 1 am tenacious
M. Bousard. I am not offended at your
procedure, and I wi'l remain.""
""Remain if vou like. T consider you
as gone, and l win not converse iur-
ther with vou.""
And M. Bousard turned toward the
wall, irrumblinir: ""Did vou ever see
the like; to disturb a peaceful man, to
rouse him from his sleep, for the pur
pose of listening to such nonsense.
Suddenly M. Bousard made a bound
from his bed.
Anatole had taken up one of the
trombones of the professor, into which
he blew with might and main, madly
movinir the slide. Infernal sounds
were emitted by the instrument.
""My cherished trombone, given me
by my pupils! Leave the instrument
alone, monsieur.""
""Monsieur, said Anatole, ""you con­
sider me as departed. I consider you
as absent, and I am amusing myself
while waiting for your return. Um-pa!
Um-pa! What dulcet melody!""
""You will cause me to receive notice
to leave the house. My neighbors will
not tolerate the trombone after mid--
night.""
""Then all I can say is, they have no
love of music in their souls. Z-z-z-z!
Wow! Tootle-too! Um-pa! Um-pa!""
""Stop, for mercy's sake.""
""Do you consent, then?""
""To what?""
""To give up the marriage?""
""But monsieur, I can't do it.""
""Then, um-pa!""
""M. Capendac is a terrible man. If I
affront him thus he will kill me.""
""Does that reason influence you?""
""Yes, and others besides.""
""In that case leave all to me. Only
swear to me that if I obtain the consent
of M. Capendac to the breaking of the
match my cousin shall be free.""
""Yes, monsieur, she shall be free.""
""Bravo. I have your word. Permit
me to retire. But where does this Ca
pendac live?""
""Number 100, Itue des Deux-Epees.""
""I will go there. Good-by.""
""As for you,"" thought M. Bousard,
""you are putting your head in the lion's
mouth, and you will be taught a lesson
that you deserve to learn.""
Meanwhile Anatole hastened to the
address indicate ri. When he arrived
there it was six oV..ek in the morning.
""Ting-a-ling-a-ling.""
""Who is there?"" said a deep voice
from within.
Open. I am the bearer of a very im
portant message from M. Bousard.""
He heard the noise of a safety-chain
being displaced, and of a key with which
three locks were successively opened.
""Here is a man well defended,""
thought Anatole.
Finally the door was opened. Ana
tole found himself in the presence of a
gentleman with a large, curled mus
tache, who wore a fencing costume as
his night-dress.
""Always ready, you see. It is my in
vention.
The walls of the ante-chamber were
hidden by suits of armor. In the little
parlor into which Capendac conducted
his visitor, he saw only weapons galore;
ataghans, poisoned arrows, sabres, one
and two-mded swords, pistols, lances;
there was plenty there to make a timid
heart quail.
Bah."" thought Anatole, ""what do I
risk now? Two hours and a half at the
most. Here sroes.
""Monsieur,"" said Anatole, ""you are
going to marry Mile. Nicette?""
""Yes, monsier.
""Monsieur, 3-ou shall not marry her.""
""Blood and thunder, and who will
hinder me?""
""I will.""
Capendac looked askance at Anatole,
who was not a large man, but who
seemed very determined.
Ah, young man,"" said he at length.
you are lucky to find me in a pleasant
humor.. Profit by it. uo you Know tnat
I have fought 20 duels in which I have
had the misfortune to slay five of my
adversaries and to wound the other 15?
Once mora I warn you to retire.

""I see,"" replied Anatole, ""that yon are
an adversary worthy of my steel, and
my desire increases to measure swords

with a man so redoubtable. Let us see.
Suppose we fight with those two swords
by the chimney, or these cavalry sabers,
are these or what do you say to these
curved ataghans. You don't decide.
Why do you hesitate?""
""I was thinking of your mother and
the grief your death would cause her,
""I am an orphan. Do you prefer the
carbine, the pistol, or the revolver?""
""Young man, do not fool with these
firearms.""
""Are you afraid? You tremble.""
""I tremble? Nonsense, it is the cold
""Then either fight or renounce the
hand of Nicette.""
""I like your pluck. The brave should
always be in harmony with each other,
Do you wish me to confess something
to you?""
""Out with it.""
""For some time past I have wished
to free myself from this betrothal. But
I did not know how to go to work about
it. I would consent very willingly to
what you desire of me, but you must
understand that I, Capendac, cannot
have the air of yielding to threats.
Now, you have menaced me.""
""I withdraw the menace.
""Then it is agreed.""
""Will you write and sign yourrelin
quishment of Nicette?""
'I have so much sympathy for you
that I can refuse you nothing.""
Furnished with the precious paper,
Anatole hurried back to the residence
of M. Bousard. He reached his door at
ci?ht o'clock.
""Ti n g-a-li n g-a-1 i ng.""
""Who is there?""
""Anatole.""
""Be off to bed,"" cried the professor,
wrathf ully.
""I have the consent of M. Capendac.
Open, or I will have to break the door.""
M. Bousard opened it. Anatole
showed him the paper, and going to the
door of Nicette's room, called out:
""Cousin, rise, dress yourself quickly
and come down.""
Some minutes after Nicette, fresh as
the dawn, came into the little parlor.
What is the matter?"" she inquired.
The matter is,"" answered M. Bou
sard, ""that your cousin is crazy.""
""If that be so there is at any rate
method in my madness."" exclaimed
natole. ""This very night, my dear
cousin. 1 have achieved two thinsrs. JU.
Capendac has renounced his claim to
your hand and your excellent guardian
consents that you shall marry whom
you please.""
""Beally and truly, my guardian, ami
free to marrv Anatole?""
""Ha!"" exclaimed Anatole.
""Then. I love you. my cousin.""
At that moment Anatole felt his heart
beat rapidly. Was it by reason of the
pleasure which the unexpected avowal
of Nicette had caused him? Was it the
pang predicted by Dr. Bardais? Was it
death?
""Wretch that I am!"" exclaimed the
poor fellow. ""The cup of happiness is
at my lips, and I am going to die with­
out tasting it it.""
Then feverishly taking Nicette's
hand, he told her all: How he had re
ceived the letter which contained the
flower whose fragrance he had inhaled;
and of the prognostic of Dr. Bardais;
how he had made his will in her favor, j
the steps he had subsequently taken,
and the success with which his efforts
had been crowned.
""And now,"" sighed he, ""I must die.""
""But it is impossible,"" said Nicette;
the doctor is deceived. Whoishe?""
A man who is never wrong in his
diagnosis, Nicette Dr. Bardais.""
Bardais, Bardais!"" cried M. Bousard
suddenly, bursting out laug-hinsr.
Hear what the morning paper says:
The learned Dr. Bardais has just
been suddenly stricken with mental
alienation. The mania from which he
suffers is of a scientific character. It
is well known that the doctor made a
special study of poisonous substances.
He believes now that all whom he meets
are poisoned, and endeavors to per
suade them that such is the case. He
was removed at midnight to the big
whote house.
""Nicette!""
""Anatole!""
The young couple had rushed intt
each other's arms, and were locked in
a fond embrace. Translated from the

As the years go by we become little
by little out of touch with the things
with which we were wont to delight
our childish hearts. Who that is
grown to manhood or womanhood
would find much pleasure in wading
through the deep snow and exposing
himself to cold and wet? Yet when
the thick mantle of white recently cov
ered the earth, boys and girls by the
dozens might be seen romping where
the drifts were deepest, falling, rolling.
deluging one another, and all in the
best of spirits. Or they built strong
forts behind whose walls an enormous
amount of ammunition was stored in
the shape of snowballs deftly rolled,
ready for use in repelling an attack of
the enemy, should one be ventured.
Then came the sally with arms laden
with the cold, white missiles, and such
shouting and laughter as only children
can produce. And, too. there was the
building of great snow men. whose '
portly bodies rested on prodigious legs
and whose heads comfortably adjoined
their shoulders without the oother ol
intervening necks. All these are among
the joj-s that we knew in younger days.
They are just as potent and full of at­
tractiveness to the youths of to-day as
they were to us. and so it will be as long
as ine world wags on and snow falls.
And although we no longer feel oui
spirits moving us to take part in thest
sports, we should look upon them with
a deal of sympathy, recalling the tl.Ues
when they were to us of as much im­
portance as the more serious game ot
life now seems to be. Detroit Free

love a man whom I can give the odds of

Washington, May 22. In anticipation
of the prompt return of the volunteer
troops in the Philippines the secretary
of war today telegraphed instructions
to Gen. Shafter, commanding the de­
partment of California at San Francisco
to establish a model camp at the Presi­
dio for the accommodation of about 4,000
volunteers from Manila pending their
muster out. Gen. Shafter is instructed
particularly to make ample provision
for water supply and sanitary features
""to the end that the camp may be com­
fortable and healthful.""
He is informed that big sacks are to
be furnished and floors laid if he thinks
it advisable. The returning troops will
leave their tents at Manila but. will
bring their field ranges and cooking out­
fits. The quartermaster's department
has been ordered to supply the neces­
sary tents to the camp at the Presidio.

He was a little bit of a darky, not
much bigger than a lump of coal and
not much whiter, and when I
him up to do an errand for me across
the street his eyes snapped as if they
were electrified.
""What is your name?"" I inquired.
""Tank, boss,"" he answered, with a
bow and a grin.
""That's a queer kind of a name.
Your people aren't temperance folks,

'Deed, boss, I dunno. Dey calls me
Tank, but my name's Pasquotank Per­

""Oh!"" I laughed. ""That's name
enough for two kids like you. Where
do you come from?""
""I'se f'nm Norf Ca'liny, boss.""
""What are you doing so far from

""Doin the best I kin, boss.""

He stopped a moment to study.
""How much have you made today?""
""When I gets de 10 cents you's

shrewd little smile—I had not agreed
upon a price at all—""an I gets 10 cents

""Is that all? Ycu can't live on 20

there, came into the little black face,
and with it a hard line as of determi­

Wa No A it

The New York Times relates an anec­
dote concerning Mr. Howells that is
good enough to be true, whether it is
or not. According to report, a dispute
as to the words ""lunch"" and ""lunch­
eon"" recently arose between Mr. and
Mrs. Howells. Mr. Howells championed
""lunch"" as the proper term, while his
wife defended ""luncheon."" At last, at
Mr. Howells' suggestion, they appealed
to the Century Dictionary to settle the
question. ""Well, I was right, after
all!"" he exclaimed in triumph, and he
read aloud the following extract quoted
as showing correct usage: ""We lunched
fairly upon little dishes of rose leaves
delicately preserved.""
""From what author is that sentence
taken?"" inquired Mrs. Howells.
""Why. I declare, from W. D- How­
ells!""
""Pshaw!"" was the retort. ""He's no
authority.""

It is a well known fact that if the
young of almost any kind of bird are
taken from the nest before they can fly
the old ones will feed them most atten­
tively if the cage in which the iittle
birds are inclosed is placed somewhere
where the parents can reach it, and a
popular but erroneous belief is current
that they do this for a time, and end
by poisoning the young ones.

This, however, is a mistake, the fact
being that at a certain stage of a young
bird's existence, when it i3 naturally
able to begin catering for itself, the
parent birds, also quite naturally, cease
to attend it, and then, if the birdlings
are shut up in the cage and their cus­
todian has not thought of placing some
food at their disposal they necessarily
die, not from poison administered by
the parents, but from starvation.—St

is a small crevice in the rocks, but as !
he crawls into the crevice on hands
and knees he finds that it widens as
he goes down. About fifteen feet from j
the entrance a man can stand up and ;
walk down the gradual incline, which j
is at about BO degrees. At a place '
thirty feet from the mouth there is a ]
raise some thirty feet high and a drift
forty feet long. The sight which meets j
the cave seeker's gaze at this point is
most beautiful. On the ceiling large
stalactites hang In clusters, and the
walls are decorated with glistening
crystals of lime or stalagmites inter­
mingled with drops of water, giving it
the appearance of being set with mil­
lions of diamonds.
Further down the cave widens until
a chamber is reached which is over
sixty feet across and over fifty feet
high. There are numerous other pas­
sages or caverns, and on the left there
is a passage big enough to admit the
body, that opens into a second cham­
ber which Is about twenty feet across j
and ten or fifteen feet high, n the
main chamber, some twenty feet high,
can be seen the opening of another
chamber, hut as there is no timber
near to make ladders the upper cav­
ern has not yet been explored. There
are no doubt other large chambers
which could be found were closer ex­
plorations to be made. Stalactites and
stalagmite can be seen in all direc­
tions. Water is dropping continually,
ami the light of a candle shining upon
these crystals and drops of water gives
the cave a very entrancing appear­
ance. This cave is the home of the
wood rat, and there are indications
that there might be thousands of the
little animals which make this natural
wonder their home.

MANILA,

July 1.—A collision between

the two armies at San Fernando seems
inevitable soon. The insurgents ure
active all around the town and can be
seen working in the trenches to
strengthen their position. Day and
night forces are at work. It is esti­
mated that 8,000 men were seen march­
ing in the road north of the town Satur­
day morning. The Americans turned
out and manned the defenses, expecting
an attack. The soldiers slept in their
clothes and breakfasted at 4 o'clock in
the morning so as to be ready for an­
other daybreak assault. The commis­
sion of three Spanish officers who

Eutered the ln»urg«nt Lines

a fortnight ago to make a final attempt
to arrange for the release of the Spanish
prisoners have not returned. Their
long absencfe has occasioned alarm, but
reports come to Manila that they were
received by Aguinaldo at Tarlac and
entertained hospitably. It is said that
Aguinaldo gave a banquet in their,
honor, all the leading families of the
rebel leader's present cabinet attending,
hence the Spaniards in Manila hope
that the mission of the .commissioners
will be successful.

General Ovenshine is in the hospital
suffering with fever. General Grant is
commanding his troops on the south
line.

View of General H. G. Otl« of the Situa­
tion In the Philippines.
CfliCAGO, July 1.—General Harrison

Gray Otis of Los Angeles, Cal., who
was with the Eighth army corps at
Manila, and who saw nearly a year's
fighting around that city, has arrived in,
Chicago en route for Washington.'
He stopped at the Palmer House and'
will remain in the city until evening,
before proceeding eastward. His visit
to Washington will mark his muster
out of the volunteer service.

General Otis discussed the situation
in the Philippines at considerable length
and took the hopeful view that with
the additional troops to be furnished
the war would be terminated before the
next rainy season sets in.
""With 60,000 troops all told—say 80,­
000 for the fighting columns and 20,000
for garrison duty,"" he said, ""Major
General Otis can suppress the revolt
before the next rainy season, restore
peace, establish order, protect all well
meaning natives of Luzon in their rights
of person and property, and establish
and maintain a simple, economical, just
and effective government over the isl­
ands.""

""Effective strength. 940 men 150 men

The temperature at the bottom of
the ocean is nearly down to freezing
point, and sometimes actually below
it. There is a total absence of light,
as far as sunlight .ia concerned, and
there is an enormous pressure, reck­
oned at about a' ton to the square
inch in every thousand fathoms which
is LG0 times greater than that of the
atmosphere we live in. At 2,500
fathoms the pressure is thirty times
more powerful than the steam pressure
of a locomotive when drawing a train.
As late as 1SS0 aleading zoologist ex­
plained the existence of deep sea ani­
mals at such depths by assuming that
thc.r bodies were composed of solids
aud liquids of great density and con­
tained no air. This, however, is not
the case with deep soa fiih, which are
provided with air inflated swimming
bladders. If one of these fish in full
chase after its prey happens to ascend
beyond a certain level its bladder be­
comes distended with the decreased
pressure, and carries it, in ppite of its
course. In tact, members of this un­
fortunate class are liable to become
victims to the unusual accidents of
failing upward, and no doubt meet
with a violent death soon after leaving
their accustomed level, and long be­
fore their bodies reach the surface in
a distorted and unnatural state, Even
ground sharks, brought from a depth
of no more than fiye hundred fathoms,
expire before they gain the surface.

jo The Filipino rebels appear to retain
much more of a fighting spirit than
might be expected after their recent
San Fernando experiences and1 Gen.
Lawton's drubbings in the south.
After giving up San Fernando with
a feeble struggle they entrenched thera­
selves at Angeles, working for several
days and impressing non-combatants
Into the work thus saving the armed
men for the fighting. They engaged
Lieut. Col. Smith's regiment and the
artillery warmly for four hours, mak­
ing one of the most stubborn resist­
ances of the campaign. But the Ameri­
cans are indebted to the usual poor
marksmanship of the Filipinos, as well
as to their own strategy for their small
losses.

One of the -worst traits of humanity
fa Insincerity.
Adversity often makes a vain person,
tumbler And wiser.
Every man has his favorites and ho
usually heads the list.
Happiness Is very unsatisfactory
when seen through the eyes of others.
Pity the man who brags. He has to,
flo It in order to brace up his self­
respect.The man who sells his vote probably,
gets what ho wanU, but not what ho­
ought to get.
A man's repentcnce Is never genulnei
when It merely comes from the fact'
that he was discovered.
There are still four widows of revo­
lutionary soldiers on the pension rolls;
of the government at Washington. At,
this rate the United States will be pay-'
ing pensions to soldiers of the civil
iwar or their widows well on In the last
Quarter of the coming century and to
soldiers or their widows of the Span-;
ash-American war nearly to the close
bf the first quarter of the twenty-first
century. It takes a long time to close
up the expense account of a war.
' The English parliament recently
passed a bill compelling shopkeepers to.
provide Beats for their women clerks.
Quite as effectual a relief bill was re­
cently passed In a club of rich girls in
these words: ""We will not price
things which we do not Intend to buy;
we will make our selections quickly;
we will not shop on hot days nor at
late hours."" Whenever we blame pub­
lic conditions, might we not, like these
generous-hearted girls, ask ourselves
who the public is?
The general introduction of women,
into employment before held by men
has had the most far-reaching social
effects. It is not necessary, and would
not be appropriate here to enter Into)
a consideration of the question whether
the result of such general employment
of women has been beneficial or the
reverse in its effects on society. What-:
ever conclusions may be reached on
that very comprehensive subject It is
quite plain that the employment of)
women in the business pursuits is des­
tined to be less, rather than more, gen­
eral in the future than it has been in
iie immediate past.
Taurie acid, a new chemical discov-.
ery, obtained from taurlc moss a lich­
en or fungus, usually found upon rocks
and the roots of trees throughout the
country has been found to possess
properties which will render It inval­
uable as a solvent of metals. Gold,
silver, steel, aluminum and lead, when'
immersed in the acid, become pliable;
and ductile as putty. The advantages­
it presents for workers in metal .
more especially jewelers are readily
apparent. Designs can be molded by
the handa alone, without the use or so
sistance of heat. Strange to say, how­
ever, the acid has no effect upon Iron.
For years and years almost Innumer­
able writers, some of them learned in
maritime matters, and others only In­
terested in, such things, have been
preaching the necessity for intelligent
and united action, either by govern­
ments or shipowners, to the end that
abandoned vessels may not be allowed
to remain afloat in the ocean highways,
increasing materially the perils of nav
igation and giving needless proof that
what is everybody's business is no
body's. Lamentably little has been ac
complished by an tnis exnortauon ana
Its continuance seems discouraglngly
like a waste of energy. The issue is
a thoroughly live one, however, and
perhaps by constantly harping on it
the vast number of people whose lives
re often and whose property Is con
stantly menaced by these derelicts may
at last be moved to enforce the reme
dying of the present neglect of a great
evil.
A girl in a New England factory
wrote her name several months ago
on a bolt of cotton. Recently she re­
ceived a letter from a woman In Arizo­
na savlnz that the cloth had been
bought by the government, and was be­
ing cut up for garments in an Apache
Indian school. It la but a few years
ago that the Apaches thought more of
nklnz scales than of schools In which
shirt making is done. While the miU
girl's act elicited this striking com­
parison, it was an act to be unhesitat­
ingly condemned. A girl's name so
represents herself that to have it light­
ly bandied about in writing, or In pub­
lic conveyances, or in the mouths of
strangers, reflects meretriciously upon
her character. Had the bolt of cotton
fallen into unscrupulous hands, the
letter sent from Arizona might have
been anything but pleasing t' the
thoughtless recipient.
It looks as if ""Porto Rico"" was to
become the proper spelling of that
word, in spite of the long-standing
recommendation of the board of geo­
graphic names that it be written
Puerto Rico. ' The postofflce depart­

which was used, by the way, In the
treaty of peace, and President McKin­
ley is said to prefer It. Americans like
short cuts.

The fourteenth of December will be the
one hundredth anniversary of the death
of Washington. For a hundred years the
republic has had the priceless advantage
of the lofty standard of character and
conduct which lie bequeathed to the
American people. It is an inheritance
which time, instead of wasting, contin­
ually increases and enriches. ""We may
justly hope that in the years to come the
benignant influence of the father of his
country may be even more potent for good
than ia the century which is drawing to
a close. 1 have been glad to learn that
in many parts of the country the people
will fittingly observe this historic anni­
versary.Presented to this congress are great op­
portunities. With them come great re­
sponsibilities. The power confided to tls
increases the weight of our obligations
to the people and we must be profoundly
sensitive of them as we contemplate the
new and grave problems which confront
us. Aiming only at the public good,
we can not err. A right interpretation
of tile people's will and of duty can not
fail to insure wise measures for the wel­
fare of the islands which have come un­
der the authority of the United States
and insure to the common interest and
lasting honor of our country. Never has
this nation had more abundant cause
than during the past year for thankful­
ness to God for manifold blessings and
mercies for which we make reverent ac­
knowledgment. WILLIAM M KIXLET.
