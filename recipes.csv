(that has been nicely flavored with vegetables) on ice in a bowl,
whisking it till it is a white froth; then add half a pint of salad oil
and six spoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, _by degrees_, first oil, then
vinegar, continually whisking till it forms a white, smooth, sauce-like
cream; season with half a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter ditto of white
pepper, and a very little sugar, whisk it a little more and it is ready.
It should be dressed pyramidically over the article it is served with.
The advantage of this sauce is that (although more delicate than any
other) you may dress it to any height you like, and it will remain so
any length of time; if the temperature is cool, it will remain hours
without appearing greasy or melting. It is absolutely necessary,
however, that it should be prepared on ice.",recipe

bread between two of meat, and have the other two slices outside; fasten
together with short wooden skewers. If you have a quick oven, put it in;

29982_anothervealandhampie.txt,"ANOTHER VEAL AND HAM PIE, more usual, and probably the ""weal and hammer""
that ""mellered the organ"" of Silas Wegg, was manufactured by Mrs. Boffin
from this recipe; it is as follows:

Take the thick part of breast of veal, removing all the bones, which put
on for gravy, stewing them long and slowly; put a layer of veal, pepper
and salt, then a thin sprinkling of ham; if boiled, cut in slices; if
raw, cut a slice in dice, which scald before using, then more veal and
again ham. If force-meat balls are liked, make some force-meat as for
Windsor pie, using if you prefer it chopped hard-boiled eggs in place of
chopped meat, and binding into a paste with a raw egg; then make into
balls, which drop into the crevices of the pie; boil two or three eggs
quite hard, cut each in four and lay them round the sides and over the
top, pour in about a gill of gravy, and cover the same as the Windsor
pie. In either of these pies the force-meat may be left out, a
sweetbread cut up, or mushrooms put in.

29982_baba.txt,"BABA.--One pound of flour; take one quarter of it, and make a sponge
with half an ounce of compressed yeast and a little warm water, set it
to rise, make a hole in the rest of the flour, add to it ten ounces of
butter, three eggs, and a dessert-spoonful of sugar, a little salt,
unless your butter salts it enough, which is generally the case. Beat
all together well, then add five more eggs, one at a time, that is to
say, add one egg and beat well, then another and beat again, and so on
until the five are used. When the paste leaves the bowl it is beaten
enough, but not before; then add the sponge to it, and a large half
ounce of citron chopped, the same of currants, and an ounce and a half
of sultana raisins, seedless. Let it rise to twice its size, then bake
it in an oven of dark yellow paper heat; the small round babas are an
innovation of the pastry-cook to enable him to sell them uncut. But the
baba proper should be baked in a large, deep, upright tin, such as a
large charlotte russe mold, when they keep for several days fresh, and
if they get stale, make delicious fritters, soaked in sherry and dipped
in frying batter.

In some cases, however, it may be preferred to make them as usually seen
at French pastry cooks; for this purpose you require a dozen small-sized
_round_ charlotte russe molds, which fill half full only, as they rise
very much; bake these in a hotter oven, light brown paper heat; try with
a twig as you would any other cake, if it comes out dry it is done; then
prepare a syrup as follows: Boil half pound of sugar in a pint of water,
add to this the third of a pint of rum, and some apricot pulp--peach
will of course do--and boil all together a few minutes; pour this half
an inch deep in a dish, and stand the cake or cakes in it; it should
drink up all the syrup, you may also sprinkle some over it. If any syrup
remains, use it to warm over your cake when stale, instead of the

29982_boucheesdesdames.txt,"BOUCHÉES DES DAMES, a very ornamental and delicious little French cake,
is sufficiently novel to deserve a place here, I think. Make any nice
drop cake batter (either sponge, or sponge with a little butter in it I
prefer); drop one on buttered paper and bake; if it runs, beat in a
_little_ more flour and sugar, but not much, or your cakes will be
brittle; they should be the size, when done, of a fifty-cent piece, and
I find half a teaspoonful of batter dropped generally makes them about
right. Have a tin cutter or tin box lid, if you have no cutter so small,
about the size, and with it trim each cake when baked; then take half
the number and spread some with a very thin layer of red currant jelly,
others with peach or raspberry; then on each so spread put a cake that
is unspread, thus making a tiny sandwich or jelly cake. If you have
different sorts of jelly, put each separate, as you must adapt the
flavor of your icing to the jelly. For red currant, ice with chocolate
icing. Recipes for icing are so general that I refer you to your cookery
book. Those with peach may have white icing, flavored with almond, or
with rum, beating in a little more sugar if the flavoring dilutes your
icing too much. Almond flavoring goes well with raspberry. Cakes with
raspberry jelly or jam should be iced pink, coloring the icing with
prepared cochineal or cranberry juice. Thus you have your cakes brown,
pink, and white, which look very pretty mixed.

The process of icing is difficult to do after they are put together, but
they are much handsomer this way, and keep longer. You require, to
accomplish it, a good quantity of each kind of icing, and a number of
little wooden skewers; stick one into each cake and dip it in the icing,
let it run off, then stand the other end of the skewer in a box of sand
or granulated sugar. The easiest way is to ice each half cake before
putting in the jelly; when the icing is hard spread with jelly, and put
together.",recipe

stiff; when tender enough to mash through a coarse sieve or fine
colander add it to the stock, which must have been strained and be quite
free from sediment, season with salt and a little _white_ pepper or
cayenne, boil all together gently a few minutes. It should look like
rich cream, and be strongly flavored with celery. Of course the quantity

vinegar, the same of Harvey or Worcestershire sauce, the same of
mustard, a _little_ cayenne, and a tablespoonful of salad oil, or butter
melted; mix all till like cream, and take care your meat is thoroughly

See that the fire is clear, and while the gridiron is getting hot, chop
a teaspoonful of parsley very fine, mix it up with a piece of butter the

Then put the meat to be grilled on the fire and turn often, so that it

thickened with roux (or water will do if you have no broth).

ounces of flour, three macaroons, four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar,
the peel of a grated lemon, and a little citron cut very fine, a little
brandy and orange-flower water. Put all the ingredients, except the
eggs, in a saucepan--of course you will mix the flour smooth in the
cream first--let them come to a boil slowly, stirring to prevent lumps;
when the flour smells cooked, take it off the fire for a minute, then
stir the beaten yolks of eggs into it. Stand the saucepan in another of
boiling water and return to the stove, stirring till the eggs seem
done--about five minutes, if the water boils all the time. Line patty
pans with puff paste, and fill with frangipané and bake. Ornament with
chopped almonds and meringue, or not, as you please.

It is very difficult to make fine puff paste in warm weather, and almost
impossible without ice; for this reason I think the brioche paste
preferable; but if it is necessary to have it for any purpose, you must
take the following precautions:

Have your water iced; have your butter as firm as possible by being
kept on ice till the last moment; make the paste in the coolest place
you have, and under the breeze of an open window, if possible; make it
the day before you use it, and put it on the ice between every ""turn,""
as each rolling out is technically called; then leave it on the ice, as
you use it, taking pieces from it as you need them, so that the warmth
cannot soften the whole at once, when it would become quite
unmanageable. The condition of the oven is a very important matter, and
I cannot do better than transcribe the rules given by Gouffé, by which
you may test its fitness for any purpose:

Put half a sheet of writing paper in the oven; if it catches fire it is
too hot; open the dampers and wait ten minutes, when put in another
piece of paper; if it blackens it is still too hot. Ten minutes later
put in a third piece; if it _gets dark brown_ the oven is right for all
small pastry. Called ""_dark brown paper heat_."" _Light brown paper heat_
is suitable for _vol-au-vents_ or fruit pies. _Dark yellow paper heat_
for large pieces of pastry or meat pies, pound cake, bread, etc. _Light
yellow paper heat_ for sponge cake, meringues, etc.

To obtain these various degrees of heat, you try paper every ten minutes
till the heat required for your purpose is attained. But remember that
""light yellow"" means the paper only tinged; ""dark yellow,"" the paper the
color of ordinary pine wood; ""light brown"" is only a shade darker, about
the color of nice pie-crust, and dark brown a shade darker, by no means
coffee color.",recipe

it, and throw in a wineglass of cold water, skim again, and, when it is
""on the boil,"" again throw in another wineglass of cold water; do this
two or three times. The object of adding the cold water is to keep it
just off the boil until all the scum has risen, as the boiling point is
when it comes to the surface, yet once having boiled, the scum is broken
up, and the soup is never so clear.

The meat must simmer slowly, _not boil_, for three hours before the
vegetables are added, then for a couple of hours more.

It is necessary to be very exact in the proportions of vegetables; but,
of course, after having weighed them for soups once or twice, you will
get to know about the size of a carrot, turnip, etc., that will weigh

spoonful of tarragon or plain vinegar, or a teaspoonful of mushroom
powder, or a pinch of curry, unless objected to, or a few sweet herbs.
In fact, as you may see, variety is as easy to produce as it is rare to
meet with in average cooking, and depends more on intelligence and
thoughtfulness than on anything else.

The simplest of all ways of warming a joint that is not far cut, is to
wrap it in thickly buttered paper, and put it in the oven again,
contriving, if possible, to cover it closely, let it remain long enough
to get _hot_ through, not to cook. By keeping it closely covered it will
get hot through in less time, and the steam will prevent it getting hard
and dry; make some gravy hot and serve with the meat. If your gravy is
good and plentiful, your meat will be as nice as the first day; without
gravy it would be an unsatisfactory dish. If you cannot manage to cover
the joint in the oven, you may put it in a pot over the fire _without_

29982_onbread.txt,"OF all articles of food, bread is perhaps the one about which most has
been written, most instruction given, and most failures made. Yet what
adds more to the elegance of a table than exquisite bread or breads,
and--unless you live in a large city and depend on the baker--what so
rare? A lady who is very proud of her table, and justly so, said to me
quite lately, ""I cannot understand how it is we never have really fine
home-made bread. I have tried many recipes, following them closely, and
I can't achieve anything but a commonplace loaf with a thick, hard
crust; and as for rolls, they are my despair. I have wasted eggs,
butter, and patience so often that I have determined to give them up,
but a fine loaf I will try for.""

""And when you achieve the fine loaf, you may revel in home-made rolls,""
I answered.

And so I advise every one first to make perfect bread, light, white,
crisp, and _thin-crusted_, that rarest thing in home-made bread.

I have read over many recipes for bread, and am convinced that when the
time allowed for rising is specified, it is invariably too short. One
standard book directs you to leave your sponge two hours, and the bread
when made up a _quarter of an hour_. This recipe strictly followed must
result in heavy, tough bread. As bread is so important, and so many
fail, I will give my own method from beginning to end; not that there
are not numberless good recipes, but simply because they frequently need
adapting to circumstances, and altering a recipe is one of the things a
tyro fears to do.

I make a sponge over night, using a dried yeast-cake soaked in a pint of
warm water, to which I add a spoonful of salt, and, if the weather is
warm, as much soda as will lie on a dime; make this into a stiff batter
with flour--it may take a quart or less, flour varies so much, to give a
rule is impossible; but if, after standing, the sponge has a watery
appearance, make it thicker by sprinkling in more flour, beat hard a few
minutes, and cover with a cloth--in winter keep a piece of thick flannel
for the purpose, as a chill is fatal to your sponge--and set in a warm
place free from draughts.

The next morning, when the sponge is quite light--that is to say, at
least twice the bulk it was, and like a honeycomb--take two quarts of
flour, more or less, as you require, but I recommend at first a small
baking, and this will make three small loaves; in winter, flour should
be dried and warmed; put it in your mixing bowl, and turn the sponge
into a hole in the center. Have ready some water, rather more than
lukewarm, but not _hot_. Add it gradually, stirring your flour into the
sponge at the same time. The great fault in making bread is getting the
dough too stiff; it should be as soft as possible, without being at all
sticky or wet. Now knead it with both hands from all sides into the
center; keep this motion, occasionally dipping your hands into the flour
if the dough sticks, but do not add more flour unless the paste sticks
very much; if you have the right consistency it will be a smooth mass,
very soft to the touch, _yet not sticky_, but this may not be attained
at a first mixing without adding flour by degrees. When you have kneaded
the dough until it leaves the bowl all round, set it in a warm place to
rise. When it is well risen, feels very soft and warm to the touch, and
is twice its bulk, knead it once more thoroughly, then put it in tins
either floured, and the flour not adhering shaken out, or buttered,
putting in each a piece of dough half the size you intend your loaf to
be. Now everything depends on your oven. Many people bake their bread
slowly, leaving it in the oven a long time, and this causes a thick,
hard crust. When baked in the modern iron oven, quick baking is
necessary. Let the oven be quite hot, then put a little ball of paste
in, and if it browns palely in seven to ten minutes it is about right;
if it burns, it is too hot; open the damper ten minutes. Your bread,
after it is in the tins, will rise much more quickly than the first
time. Let it get light, but not too light--_twice its bulk_ is a good
rule; but if it is light before your oven is ready, and thus in danger
of getting too porous, work it down with your hand, it will not harm it,
although it is better so to manage that the oven waits for the bread
rather than the bread for the oven. A small loaf--and by all means make
them small until you have gained experience--will not take more than
three quarters of an hour to bake; when a nice yellow brown, take it
out, turn it out of the tin into a cloth, and tap the bottom; if it is
crisp and smells cooked, the loaf is done. Once the bottom is brown it
need remain no longer. Should that, however, from fault of your oven, be
not brown, but soft and white, you must put it back in the oven, the
bottom upwards. An oven that does not bake at the bottom will, however,
be likely to spoil your bread. It is sometimes caused by a careless
servant leaving a collection of ashes underneath it; satisfy yourself
that all the flues are perfectly clean and clear before beginning to
bake, and if it still refuses to do its duty, change it, for you will
have nothing but loss and vexation of spirit while you have it in use. I
think you will find this bread white, evenly porous (not with small
holes in one part and caverns in another; if it is so you have made your
dough too stiff, and it is not sufficiently kneaded), and with a thin,
crisp crust. Bread will surely fail to rise at all if you have scalded
the yeast; the water must never be too hot. In winter, if it gets
chilled, it will only rise slowly, or not at all, and in using baker's
or German yeast take care that it is not stale, which will cause heavy,
irregular bread.

In making bread with compressed yeast proceed in exactly the same way,
excepting that the sponge will not need to be set over night, unless you
want to bake very early.

If you have once produced bread to your satisfaction you will find no
difficulty in making rolls. Proceed as follows:

Take a piece of the dough from your baking after it has risen once. To a
piece as large as a man's fist take a large tablespoonful of butter and
a little powdered sugar; work them into the dough, put it in a bowl,
cover it, and set it in a warm place to rise--a shelf behind the stove
is best; if you make this at the same time as your bread, you will find
it takes longer to rise; the butter causes that difference; when very
light, much lighter than your bread should be, take your hand and push
it down till it is not larger than when you put it in the bowl; let it
rise again, and again push it down, but not so thoroughly; do this once
or twice more, and you have the secret of light rolls. You will find
them rise very quickly, after once or twice pushing down. When they have
risen the third or fourth time, take a little butter on your hands, and
break off small pieces about the size of a walnut and roll them round.
Either put them on a tin close together, to be broken apart, or an inch
or two from each other, in which case work in a little more flour, and
cut a cleft on the top, and once more set to rise; half an hour will be
long enough generally, but in this case you must judge for yourself,
they sometimes take an hour; if they look swelled very much and smooth
they will be ready. Have a nice hot oven, and bake for twelve to fifteen
minutes.

Add a little more sugar to your dough and an egg, go through the same
process, brush them over with sugar dissolved in milk, and you will have
delicious rusks.

The above is my own method of making rolls, and the simplest I know of;
but there are numbers of other recipes given in cookery books which
would be just as good if the exact directions for letting them rise were
given. As a test--and every experiment you try will be so much gained in
your experience--follow the recipe given for rolls in any good cookery
book, take part of the dough and let it rise as therein directed, and
bake, set the other part to rise as _I_ direct, and notice the
difference.

KREUZNACH HORNS.--Either take a third of the dough made for bread with
three quarts of flour, or set a sponge with a pint of flour and a
yeast-cake soaked in half a pint of warm water or milk, making it into a
stiffish dough with another pint of flour; then add four ounces of
butter, a _little_ sugar, and two eggs; work well. If you use the bread
dough, you will need to dredge in a little more flour on account of the
eggs, but not _very much_; then set to rise as for rolls, work it down
twice or thrice, then turn the dough out on the molding board lightly
floured, roll it as you would pie-crust into pieces six inches square,
and quarter of an inch thick, make two sharp, quick cuts across it from
corner to corner, and you will have from each square four three-cornered
pieces of paste; spread each _thinly_ with soft butter, flour lightly,
and roll up very lightly from the wide side, taking care that it is not
squeezed together in any way; lay them on a tin with the side on which
the point comes uppermost, and bend round in the form of a horseshoe;
these will take some time to rise; when they have swollen much and look
light, brush them over with white of egg (not beaten) or milk and
butter, and bake in a good oven.",recipe
29982_parisjockeyclubrecipeforbrioche.txt,"PARIS JOCKEY-CLUB RECIPE FOR BRIOCHE.

Sift one pound of flour, take one fourth of it, and add rather more than
half a cake of compressed yeast, dissolved in half a gill of warm water,
make into a sponge with a _very little_ more water, put it in a warm
place; when it is double its volume take the rest of the flour, make a
hole in the center, and put in it an equal quantity of salt and sugar,
about a teaspoonful, and two tablespoonfuls of water to dissolve them.
Three quarters of a pound of butter and four eggs, beat well, then add
another egg, beat again, and add another, and so on until seven have
been used; the paste must be soft, but not spread; if too firm, add
another egg. Now mix this paste with the sponge thoroughly, beating
until the paste leaves the sides of the bowl, then put it in a crock and
cover; let it stand four hours in a warm place, then turn it out on a
board, _spread it and double it four times_, return it to the crock, and
let it rise again two hours; repeat the former process of doubling and
spreading, and put it in a very cold place for two hours, or until you
want to use it. Mold in any form you like, but the true brioche is two
pieces, one as large again as the other; form the large one into a ball,
make a deep depression in the center, on which place the smaller ball,
pressing it gently in; cut two or three gashes round it with a sharp
knife, and bake a beautiful golden brown. These brioche are such a
luxury, and so sure to come out right, that the trouble of making them
is well worth the taking, and for another reason: every one knows the
great difficulty of making puff paste in summer, and a short paste is
never handsome; but take a piece of brioche paste, roll it out thin,
dredge with flour, fold and roll again, then use as you would puff
paste; if for sweet pastry, a little powdered sugar may be sprinkled
through it instead of dredging with flour. This makes a very handsome
and delicious crust. Or, another use to which it may be put is to roll
it out, cut it in rounds, lay on them mince-meat, orange marmalade, jam,
or merely sprinkle with currants, chopped citron, and spices, fold,
press the edges, and bake.

Before quitting the subject of breads I must introduce a novelty which I
will call ""soufflée bread."" It is quickly made, possible even when the
fire is poor, and so delicious that I know you will thank me for making
you acquainted with it.

Use two or three eggs according to size you wish, and to each egg a
tablespoonful of flour. Mix the yolks with the flour and with them a
dessert-spoonful of butter melted, and enough milk to make a very
_thick_ batter, work, add a pinch of salt and a teaspoonful of sugar,
work till quite smooth, then add the whites of the eggs in a firm froth,
stir them in gently, and add a _quarter_ teaspoonful of soda and half a
one of cream of tartar. Have ready an iron frying-pan (or an earthen one
that will stand heat is better), made hot with a tablespoonful of butter
in it, also hot, but not so hot as for frying. Pour the batter (which
should be of the consistency of sponge cake batter) into the pan, cover
it with a lid or tin plate, and set it back of the stove if the fire is
hot--if very slow it may be forward; when well risen and near done, put
it in the oven, or if the oven is cold you may turn it gently, not to
deaden it. Serve when done (try with a twig), the under side uppermost;
it should be of a fine golden brown and look like an omelet. This
soufflée bread is equally good _baked_ in a tin in which is rather more
butter than enough to grease it; the oven must be _very hot indeed_.
Cover it for the few minutes with a tin plate or lid, to prevent it
scorching before it has risen; when it has puffed up remove the lid, and
allow it to brown, ten to fifteen minutes should bake it; turn it out as
you would sponge cake--very carefully, not to deaden it. To succeed with
bread you must use the very best flour.",recipe
29982_pastry.txt,"PASTRY.


TO MAKE good puff paste is a thing many ladies are anxious to do, and in
which they generally fail, and this not so much because they do not make
it properly, as because they handle it badly. A lady who was very
anxious to excel in pastry once asked me to allow her to watch me make
paste. I did so, and explained that there was more in the manner of
using than in the making up. I then gave her a piece of my paste when
completed, and asked her to cover some patty pans while I covered
others, cautioning her as to the way she must cover them; yet, when
those covered by her came out of the oven they had not risen at all,
they were like rich short paste; while my own, made from the same paste,
were toppling over with lightness. I had, without saying anything,
pressed my thumb slightly on one spot of one of mine; in that spot the
paste had not risen at all, and I think this practical demonstration of
what I had tried to explain was more useful than an hour's talk would
have been.

I will first give my method of making, which is the usual French way of
making ""_feuilletonage_."" Take one pound of butter, or half of it lard;
press all the water out by squeezing it in a cloth; this is important,
as the liquid in it would wet your paste; take a third of the butter, or
butter and lard, and rub it into one pound of _fine_ flour; add no salt
if your butter is salted; then take enough water (to which you may add
the well-beaten white of an egg, but it is not absolutely necessary) to
make the flour into a smooth, firm dough; it must not be too stiff, or
it will be hard to roll out, or too soft, or it will never make good
paste; it should roll easily, yet not stick; work it till it is very
smooth, then roll it out till it is half an inch thick; now lay the
whole of the butter in the center, fold one-third the paste over, then
the other third; it is now folded in three, with the butter completely
hidden; now turn the ends toward you, and roll it till it is half an
inch thick, taking care, by rolling very evenly, that the butter is not
pressed out at the other end; now you have a piece of paste about two
feet long, and not half that width; flour it lightly, and fold _over_
one third and under one third, which will almost bring it to a square
again; turn it round so that what was the side is now the end, and roll.
Most likely now the butter will begin to break through, in which case
fold it, after flouring lightly, in three, as before, and put it on a
dish on the ice, covering it with a damp cloth. You may now either leave
it for an hour or two, or till next day. Paste made the day before it is
used is much better and easier to manage, and in winter it may be kept
for four or five days in a cold place, using from it as required.

When ready to use your paste finish the making by rolling it out,
dredging a _little_ flour, and doubling it in three as before, and roll
it out thin; do this until from first to last it has been so doubled and
rolled seven times.

Great cooks differ on one or two points in making pastry; for instance,
Soyer directs you to put the yolk of an egg instead of the white, and a
squeeze of lemon juice into the flour, and expressly forbids you to
work it before adding the mass of butter, while Jules Gouffé says, ""work
it until smooth and shining."" I cannot pretend to decide between these
differing doctors, but I pursue the method I have given and always have
light pastry. And now to the handling of it: It must only be touched by
the lightest fingers, every cut must be made with a sharp knife, and
done with one quick stroke so that the paste is not dragged at all; in
covering a pie dish or patty pan, you are commonly directed to mold the
paste over it as thin as possible, which conveys the idea that the paste
is to be pressed over and so made thin; this would destroy the finest
paste in the world; roll it thin, say for small tartlets, less than a
quarter of an inch thick, for a pie a trifle thicker, then lay the dish
or tin to be covered on the paste, and cut out with a knife, dipped in
_hot_ water or flour, a piece a little larger than the mold, then line
with the piece you have cut, touching it as little as possible; press
only enough to make the paste adhere to the bottom, but on no account
press the border; to test the necessity of avoiding this, gently press
one spot on a tart, before putting it in the oven, only so much as many
people always do in making pie, and watch the result. When your tartlets
or pies are made, take each up on your left hand, and with a sharp knife
dipped in flour trim it round quickly. To make the cover of a pie adhere
to the under crust, lay the forefinger of your right hand lengthwise
round the border, but as far from the edge as you can, thus forming a
groove for the syrups, and pressing the cover on at the same time. A
word here about fruit pies: Pile the fruit high in the center, leaving a
space all round the sides almost bare of fruit, when the cover is on
press gently the paste, as I have explained, into this groove, then
make two or three deep holes in the groove; the juice will boil out of
these holes and run round this groove, instead of boiling out through
the edges and wasting.

This is the pastry-cook's way of making pies, and makes a much handsomer
one than the usual flat method, besides saving your syrup. To ornament
fruit pies or tartlets, whip the white of an egg, and stir in as much
powdered sugar as will make a thin meringue--a large tablespoonful is
usually enough--then when your pies or tartlets are baked, take them
from the oven, glaze with the egg and sugar, and return to the oven,
leaving the door open; when it has set into a frosty icing they are
ready to serve.

It is worth while to accomplish puff paste, for so many dainty trifles
may be made with it, which, attempted with the ordinary short paste,
would be unsightly. Some of these that seem to me novel I will describe.

Rissolettes are made with trimmings of puff paste; if you have about a
quarter of a pound left, roll it out very thin, about as thick as a
fifty-cent piece; put about half a spoonful of marmalade or jam on it,
in places about an inch apart, wet lightly round each, and place a piece
of paste over all; take a small round cutter as large as a dollar, and
press round the part where the marmalade or jam is with the thick part
of the cutter; then cut them out with a cutter a size larger, lay them
on a baking tin, brush over with white of egg; then cut some little
rings the size of a quarter dollar, put one on each, egg over again, and
bake twenty minutes in a nice hot oven; then sift white sugar all over,
put them back in the oven to glaze; a little red currant jelly in each
ring looks pretty; serve in the form of a pyramid.",recipe

29982_raisedporkpies.txt,"RAISED PORK PIES are so familiar to every one who has visited England,
and, in spite of the greasy idea, are so very good, that I introduce a
well-tried recipe, feeling sure any one who eats pork at all will find
it worth while to give them a trial; they will follow it with many
another.

The paste for them is made as follows:

Rub into two pounds of flour a liberal half pound of butter, then melt
in half a pint of hot, but not boiling milk, another half pound--or it
may be lard; pour this into the flour, and knead it into a smooth, firm
paste. Properly raised pies should be molded by hand, and I will
endeavor to describe the method in case any persevering lady would like
to try and have the orthodox thing. But pie molds of tin, opening at
the side, are to be bought, and save much trouble; the mold, if used,
should be well buttered, and the pie taken out when done, and returned
to the oven for the sides to brown.

To ""raise"" a pie, proceed thus: While the paste is warm, form a ball of
paste into a cone; then with the fist work inside it, till it forms an
oval cup; continue to knead till you have the walls of an even
thickness, then pinch a fold all around the bottom. If properly done,
you have an oval, flat-bottomed crust, with sides about two inches high;
fill this with pork, fat and lean together, well peppered and salted;
then work an oval cover, as near the size of the bottom cover as you
can, and wet the edges of the wall, lay the cover on, and pinch to match
the bottom; ornament as directed for Windsor pie, wash with egg, and
bake a pale brown in a moderate oven; they must be well cooked, or the
meat will not be good. One containing a pound of meat may be cooked an
hour and a quarter. All these pies are served in slices, cut through to
the bottom.

Galantines are very handsome dishes, not very difficult to make, and
generally popular. I give a recipe for a very simple and delicious one:

Take a fine breast of veal, remove all gristle, tendons, bones, and trim
to fifteen inches in length and eight wide; use the trimmings and bones
to help make the jelly, then put on the meat a layer of force-meat made
thus: Take one pound of sausage meat, or lean veal, to which add half a
pound of bread-crumbs, parsley and thyme to taste; grate a _little_
nutmeg, pepper, salt, and the juice of half a lemon; have also some long
strips an inch thick of fat bacon or pork, and lean of veal, and lean
ham, well seasoned with pepper, salt, and finely chopped shallots. Lay
on the meat a layer of force-meat an inch thick, leaving an inch and a
half on each side uncovered; then lay on your strips of ham, veal, and
bacon fat, alternately; then another of force-meat, but only half an
inch thick, as too much force-meat will spoil the appearance of the
dish; if you have any cold tongue, lay some strips in, also a few
blanched pistachio nuts (to be obtained of a confectioner) will give the
appearance of true French galantine. Roll up the veal, and sew it with a
packing or coarse needle and fine twine, tie it firmly up in a piece of
linen. Observe that you do not put your pistachio nuts amid the
force-meat, where, being green, their appearance would be lost; put them
in crevices of the meats.

Cook this in sufficient water to cover, in which you must have the
trimmings of the breast and a knuckle of veal, or hock of pork, two
onions, a carrot, half a head of celery, two cloves, a blade of mace,
and a good bunch of parsley, thyme and bay leaf, two ounces of salt. Set
the pot on the fire till it is at boiling point, then draw it to the
back and let it simmer three hours, skimming carefully; then take it
from the fire, leaving it in the stock till nearly cold; then take it
out, remove the string from the napkin, and roll the galantine up
tighter--if too tight at first it will be hard--tying the napkin at each
end only; then place it on a dish, set another dish on it, on which
place a fourteen-pound weight; this will cause it to cut firm. When
quite cold, remove strings and cloth, and it is ready to be ornamented
with jelly. When the stock in which the galantine was cooked is cold
take off the fat and clarify it, first trying, however, if it is in
right condition, by putting a little on ice. If it is not stiff enough
to cut firm, you must reduce it by boiling; if too stiff, that is
approaching glaze, add a _little_ water, then clarify by adding whites
of eggs, as directed to clarify soup (see soups). A glass of sherry and
two spoonfuls of tarragon or common vinegar are a great improvement.
Some people like this jelly cut in dice, to ornament the galantine, part
of it may then also serve to ornament other dishes at the table. But I
prefer to have the galantine enveloped in jelly, which may be done by
putting it in an oblong soup tureen or other vessel that will contain
it, leaving an inch space all round, then pouring the jelly over it.

Jellied fish is a favorite dish with many, and is very simple to
prepare; it is also very ornamental. Take flounders or almost any flat
fish that is cheapest at the time you require them. Clean and scrape
them, cut them in small pieces, but do not cut off the fins; put them in
a stew-pan with a few small button onions or one large one, a half
teaspoonful of sugar, a glass of sherry, a dessert-spoonful of lemon
juice, and a small bunch of parsley. To one large flounder put a quart
of water, and if you are going to jelly oysters put in their liquor and
a little salt. Stew long and slowly, skimming well; then strain, and if
not perfectly clear clarify as elsewhere directed. (See if your stock
jellies, by trying it on ice before you clarify.) Now take a mold, put
in it pieces of cold salmon, eels that have been cooked, or oysters, the
latter only just cooked enough in the stock to plump them; pour a little
of the jelly in the mold, then three or four half slices of lemon, then
oysters or the cold fish, until the mold is near full, disposing the
lemon so that it will be near the sides and decorate the jelly; then
pour the rest of the jelly over all and stand in boiling water for a few
minutes, then put it in a cold place, on ice is best, for some hours.
When about to serve, dip the mold in hot water, turn out on a dish,
garnish with lettuce leaves or parsley and hard-boiled eggs. The latter
may be introduced into the jelly cut in quarters if it is desired; very
ornamental force-meat balls made bright green with spinach juice are
also an improvement in appearance.",recipe
29982_salmiofcoldmeat.txt,"SALMI OF COLD MEAT is exceedingly good. Melt butter in a saucepan, if
for quite a small dish two ounces will be sufficient; when melted, stir
in a little flour to thicken; let it brown, but not burn, or, if you are
preparing the dish in haste, put in some brown flour; then add a glass
of white or red wine and a cup of broth, or a cup of water and a slice
of glaze, a sprig or two of thyme, parsley, a small onion, chopped, and
one bay leaf, pepper, and salt. Simmer all thoroughly (all savory dishes
to which wine is added should simmer long enough for the distinct
""winey"" flavor to disappear, only the strength and richness remaining).
Strain this when simmered half an hour and lay in the cold meat. Squeeze
in a little lemon juice and draw the stew-pan to the back of the stove,
but where it will cook no longer, or the meat will harden. Serve on
toast, and pour the sauce over. A glass of brandy added to this dish
when the meat goes in is a great addition, if an extra fine salmi is
desired. By not allowing the flour and butter to brown and using white
wine, this is a very fine sauce in which to warm cold chicken, veal, or

thin slices of lean boiled ham; put at the bottom of one of these
veal-pie dishes or ""bakers,"" about two to three inches deep, a layer of
the veal, seasoned, then one of ham, then one of force-meat, made as
follows: Take a little veal, or if you have sausage-meat ready-made, it
will do, as much fine dry bread-crumbs, a dessert-spoonful of _finely_
chopped parsley, in which is a salt-spoonful of powdered thyme, savory,
and marjoram, if you have them, with salt and pepper, and mix with
enough butter to make it a crumbling paste; lay a _thin_ layer of this
on the ham, then another of veal, then ham and force-meat again, until
the dish is quite full. Lay something flat upon it, and then a weight
for an hour. You must have prepared, from bones and scraps of veal,
about a pint of stiff veal jelly; pour this over the meat, and then take
strips of rich puff paste (the _brioche_ paste would be excellent in hot
weather), wet the edge of the dish, and lay the strips round, pressing
them lightly to the dish; roll the cover a little larger than the top
of the dish, and lay it on, first wetting the surface, _not the edge_,
of the strips round the lips of the dish; press the two together, then
make a hole in the center and ornament as you please; but I never
ornament the _edge_ of a pie, as it is apt to prevent the paste from
rising. An appropriate and simple ornament for meat pies is to roll a
piece of paste very thin, cut it in four diamond-shaped pieces, put one
point of each to the hole in the center so that you have one on each
end, and one each side, then roll another little piece of paste as thin
as possible, flour it and double it, then double it again, bring all the
corners together in your hand, like a little bundle, then with a sharp
knife give a quick cut over the top of the ball of paste, cutting quite
deeply, then another across; if your cut has been clean and quick, you
will now be able to turn half back the leaves of paste as if it were a
half-blown rose. The ends which you have gathered together in your hand
are to be inserted in the hole in the center of the pie. Then brush over
with yolk of egg beaten very well in a little milk or water, and bake an
hour and a half.

This way of covering and ornamenting a pie is appropriate for all meat
pies; pigeon pie should, however, have the little red feet skinned by
dipping in boiling water, then rubbed in a cloth, when skin and nails
peel off; if allowed to lie in the water, the flesh comes too; then one
pair is put at each end of the pie, a hole being cut to insert them, or
four are put in the center instead of the rose.

The Windsor pie is intended to be eaten cold, as are all veal and ham
pies, the beauty of the jelly being lost in a hot pie. Do not fail to
try it on that account, for cold pies are excellent things.",recipe

  A large turkey.
  Three sixpenny loaves of stale bread.
  One pound of fresh butter.
  Four eggs.

  Two bunches of sweet basil.

  Half an ounce of cloves.        }  pounded fine.
  A quarter of an ounce of mace. /
  A table-spoonful of salt.
  A table-spoonful of pepper.

Skewers, tape, needle, and coarse thread will be wanted.

Grate the bread, and put the crusts in water to soften. Then break
them up small into the pan of crumbled bread. Cut up a pound of
butter in the pan of bread. Rub the herbs to powder, and have two
table-spoonfuls of sweet-marjoram and two of sweet basil, or more
of each if the turkey is very large. Chop the pot-herbs, and pound
the spice. Then add the salt and pepper, and mix all the
ingredients well together. Beat slightly four eggs, and mix them
with the seasoning and bread crumbs.

After the turkey is drawn, take a sharp knife and, beginning at
the wings, carefully separate the flesh from the bone, scraping it
down as you go; and avoid tearing or breaking the skin. Next,
loosen the flesh from the breast and back, and then from the
thighs. It requires great care and patience to do it nicely. When
all the flesh is thus loosened, take the turkey by the neck, give
it a pull, and the skeleton will come out entire from the flesh,
as easily as you draw your hand out of a glove. The flesh will
then be a shapeless mass. With a needle and thread mend or sew up
any holes that may be found in the skin.

Take up a handful of the seasoning, squeeze it hard and proceed to
stuff the turkey with it, beginning at the wings, next to the
body, and then the thighs.

If you stuff it properly, it will again assume its natural shape.
Stuff it very hard. When all the stuffing is in, sew up the
breast, and skewer the turkey into its proper form, so that it
will look as if it had not been boned.

Tie it round with tape and bake it three hours or more. Make a
gravy of the giblets chopped, and enrich it with some wine and an

from the stalks, and rub the leaves to a powder. You must have at
least four table-spoonfuls of each. Add the pepper and salt, and
mix well together all the ingredients that compose the seasoning.

Cut the fat of the bacon or pork into pieces about a quarter of an
inch thick and two inches long. With a sharp knife make deep
incisions all over the round of beef and very near each other. Put
first a little of the seasoning into each hole, then a slip of the
bacon pressed down hard and covered with more seasoning. Pour a
little wine into each hole.

When you have thus stuffed the upper side of the beef, turn it
over and stuff in the same manner the under side. If the round is
very large, you will require a larger quantity of seasoning.

Put it in a deep baking dish, pour over it some wine, cover it,
and let it set till next morning. It will be much the better for
lying all night in the seasoning.

it is a large round. It will be much improved by stewing it in
lard. Let it remain all night in the oven.

before, and let it cook till dinner-time next day. Stir some wine

Butter a deep dish, and spread a sheet of paste all over the
bottom, sides, and edge.

Cut away from your beef-steak all the bone, fat, gristle, and
skin. Cut the lean in small thin pieces, about as large,
generally, as the palm of your hand. Beat the meat well with the
rolling-pin, to make it juicy and tender. If you put in the fat,
it will make the gravy too greasy and strong, as it cannot be
skimmed.

Put a layer of meat over the bottom-crust of your dish, and season
it to your taste, with pepper, salt, and, if you choose, a little
nutmeg. A small quantity of mushroom ketchup is an improvement;
so, also, is a little minced onion.

Have ready some cold boiled potatoes sliced thin. Spread over the
meat, a layer of potatoes, and a small piece of butter; then
another layer of meat, seasoned, and then a layer of potatoes, and
so on till the dish is full and heaped up in the middle, having a
layer of meat on the top. Pour in a little water.

Cover the pie with a sheet of paste, and trim the edges. Notch it
handsomely with a knife; and, if you choose, make a tulip of
paste, and stick it in the middle of the lid, and lay leaves of
paste round it.

mushrooms.

  Two nutmegs powdered.
  A large glass of wine      \
  A large glass of brandy     }mixed together.
  Half a glass of rose-water /
  A pound of citron.

Pick the currants very clean, and wash them, draining them through
a colander. Wipe them in a towel. Spread them out on a large dish,
and set them near the fire, or in the hot sun, to dry, placing the
dish in a slanting position. Having stoned the raisins, cut them
in half, and, when all are done, sprinkle them well with sifted
flour, to prevent their sinking to the bottom of the cake. When
the currants are dry, sprinkle them also with flour.

Pound the spice, allowing twice as much cinnamon as mace. Sift it,
and mix the mace, nutmeg, cinnamon together. Mix also the liquor
and rose-water in a tumbler or cup. Cut the citron in slips. Sift
the flour into a broad dish. Sift the sugar into a deep earthen
pan, and cut the butter into it. Warm it near the fire, if the
weather is too cold for it to mix easily. Stir the butter and
sugar to a cream.

Beat the eggs as light as possible. Stir them into the butter and
sugar, alternately with the flour. Stir very hard. Add gradually
the spice and liquor. Stir the raisins and currants alternately
into the mixture, taking care that they are well floured. Stir the
whole as hard as possible, for ten minutes after the ingredients
are in.

  Four calf's-feet
  A pint and a half of thick cream.
  Half a pound of loaf-sugar, broken up.
  A glass of wine.
  Half a glass of rose-water.
  A tea-spoonful of mace, beaten and sifted.

Get four calf's-feet; if possible some that have been singed, and
not skinned. Scrape, and clean them well, and boil them in three
quarts of water till all the meat drops off the bone. Drain the
liquid through a colander or sieve, and skim it well. Let it stand
till next morning to congeal. Then clean it well from the
sediment, and put it into a tin or bell-metal kettle. Stir into
it, the cream, sugar, and mace. Boil it hard for five minutes,
stirring it several times. Then strain it through a linen cloth or
napkin into a large bowl, and add the wine and rose-water.

Set it in a cool place for three or four hours, stirring it very
frequently with a spoon, to, prevent the cream from separating
from the jelly. The more it is stirred the better. Stir it till it
is cool.

Wash your moulds, wipe them dry, and then wet them with cold
water. When the blancmange becomes very thick, (that is, in three
or four hours, if the weather is not too damp) put it into your
moulds.

When it has set in them till it is quite firm, loosen it carefully
all round with a knife, and turn it out on glass or china plates.

If you wish to make it with almonds, take an ounce of blanched
bitter almonds, and two ounces of sweet. Beat them in a mortar to
a fine paste, pouring in occasionally a little rose-water. When
the mixture is ready to boil, add the almonds to it gradually,
stirring them well in. Or you may stir them in, while it is
cooling in the bowl.

If it inclines to stick to the moulds, set them an instant in hot
water. It will then turn out easily.

If you choose to make it without calf's feet, you can substitute
an ounce of the best and dearest isinglass (or, if in summer, an
ounce and a quarter) boiled with the other ingredients. If made
with isinglass, you must use two ounces of sweet, and an ounce of
bitter almonds, with the addition of the grated rind of a large
lemon, and a large stick of cinnamon, broken up, a glass of wine,
and half a glass of rose-water. Those ingredients must be all
mixed together, with a quart of cream, and boiled hard for five
minutes. The mixture must then be strained through a napkin, into
a large bowl. Set it in a cool place, and stir it frequently till
nearly cold. It must then be put into the moulds.

You may substitute for the almonds, half a gill of noyau, in which
case, omit the wine.

6677_calffeetjelly.txt,"CALF'S-FEET JELLY.

  Eight calf's feet.
  Three quarts of water.
  A pint of white wine.
  Three lemons.
  The whites of six eggs.
  Half an ounce of cinnamon.
  Half a pound of loaf-sugar, broken into lumps.

Endeavour to procure calf's-feet, that have been nicely singed,
but not skinned, as the skin being left on, makes the jelly much
firmer.

The day before you want to use the jelly, boil the eight
calf's-feet in three quarts of water, till the meat drops from the
bone. When sufficiently done, put it into a collender or sieve,
and let the liquid drain from the meat, into a broad pan or dish.
Skim off the fat. Let the jelly stand till next day, and then
carefully scrape off the sediment from the bottom. It will be a
firm jelly, if too much water has not been used, and if it has
bolted long enough. If it is not firm at first, it will not become
so afterwards when boiled with the other ingredients. There should
on no account be more than three quarts of water.

Early next morning, put the jelly into a tin kettle, or covered
tin pan; set it on the fire, and melt it a little. Take it off,
and season it with the cinnamon slightly broken, a pint of madeira
wine, three lemons cut in thin slices, and half a pound of
loaf-sugar, broken up.

If you wish it high-coloured, add two table-spoonfuls of French
brandy. Mix all well together. Beat, slightly, the whites of six
eggs (saving the egg-shell) and stir the whites into the jelly.
Break up the egg-shells into very small pieces, and throw them in
also. Stir the whole very well together.

Set it on the fire, and boil it hard five minutes, but do not stir
it, as that will prevent its clearing. Have ready a large white
flannel bag, the top wide, and the bottom tapering to a point.

Tie the bag to the backs of two chairs, or to the legs of a table,
and set a while dish or a mould under it.

After the jelly has boiled five minutes, pour it hot into the bag,
and let it drip through into the dish. Do not squeeze the bag, as
that will make the jelly dull and cloudy.

If it is not clear the first time it passes through the bag, empty
out all the ingredients, wash the bag, suspend it again, put
another white dish under-it, pour the jelly back into the bag, and
let it drip through again. Repeat this six or eight times, or till
it is clear, putting a clean dish under it every time. If it does
not drip freely, move the bag into a warmer place.

When the jelly has all dripped through the bag, and is clear, set
it in a cool place to congeal. It will sometimes congeal
immediately, and sometimes not for several hours, particularly if
the weather is warm and damp. If the weather is very cold you must
take care not to let it freeze. When it is quite firm, which
perhaps it will not be till evening, fill your glasses with it,
piling it up very high. If you make it in a mould, you must either
set the mould under the bag while it is dripping, or pour it from
the dish into the mould while it is liquid. When it is perfectly
congealed, dip the mould for an instant in boiling water to loosen
the jelly. Turn it out on a glass dish.

This quantity of ingredients will make a quart of jelly when
finished. In cool weather it may be made a day or two before it is
wanted.

You may increase the seasoning, (that is, the wine, lemon, and
cinnamon,) according to your taste, but less than the above
proportion will not be sufficient to flavour the jelly.

Ice jelly is made in the same manner, only not so stiff. Four
calves-feet will be sufficient. Freeze it as you would ice-cream,
and serve it up in glasses.",recipe

Do not sugar the top.

You may bake it either in a soup-plate, or in two small tin

Beat the yolks of sixteen eggs very light, and stir them by
degrees into the milk, which must be quite cold or the eggs will

  Three ounces of sifted flour, dried near the fire.
  Fourteen eggs.
  One pound of powdered loaf-sugar.
  Twelve drops of essence of lemon.

Blanch the almonds, by scalding them in hot water. Put them in a
bowl of cold water, and wipe them dry, when you take them out.
Pound them, one at a time, in a mortar, till they are perfectly
smooth. Mix the sweet and bitter almonds together. Prepare them,
if possible the day before the cake is made. [Footnote: While
pounding the almonds, pour in occasionally a little rose-water. It
makes them much lighter.]

Put the whites and yolks of the eggs, into separate pans. Beat the
whites till they stand alone, and then the yolks till they are
very thick.

Put the sugar, gradually, to the yolks, beating it in very hard.
Add, by degrees, the almonds, still beating very hard. Then put in
the essence of lemon. Next, beat in, gradually, the whites of the
eggs, continuing to beat for some time after they are all in.
Lastly, stir in the flour, as slowly and lightly, as possible.

Butter a large tin mould or pan. Put the cake in and bake it in a
very quick oven, an hour or more according to its thickness.

The oven must on no account be hotter at the top, than at the
bottom.

When done, set it on a sieve to cool.

Ice it, and ornament it with nonpareils.

These almond cakes are generally baked in a turban-shaped mould,
and the nonpareils put on, in spots or sprigs.

A pound of almonds in the shells (if the shells are soft and
thin,) will generally yield half a pound when shelled. Hard,
thick-shelled almonds, seldom yield much more than a quarter of a

6677_fruitpies.txt,"FRUIT PIES.

Fruit pies for family use, are generally made with common paste,
allowing three quarters of a pound of butter to a pound and a half
of flour.

Peaches and plums for pies, should be cut in half, and the stones
taken out. Cherries also should be stoned, and red cherries only
should be used for pies.

Apples should be cut into very thin slices, and are much improved
by a little lemon peel. Sweet apples are not good for pies, as
they are very insipid when baked, and seldom get thoroughly done.
If green apples are used, they should first be stewed in as little
water as possible; and made very sweet.

Apples, stewed previous to baking, should not be done till they
break, but only till they are tender. They should then be drained
in a colander, and chopped fine with a knife or the edge of a
spoon.

In making pies of juicy fruit, it is a good way to set a small
tea-cup on the bottom crust, and lay the fruit all round it. The
juice will collect under the cup, and not run out at the edges or
top of the pie. The fruit should be mixed with a sufficient
quantity of sugar, and piled up in the middle, so as to make the
pie highest in the centre. The upper crust should be pricked with
a fork, or have a slit cut in the middle. The edges should be
nicely crimped with a knife.

Dried peaches, dried apples, and cranberries should be stewed with
a very little water, and allowed to get quite cold before they are
put into the pie. If stewed fruit is put in warm, it will make the
paste heavy.

If your pies are made in the form of shells, or without lids, the
fruit should always be stewed first, or it will not be sufficiently
done, as the shells (which should be of puff paste) must not
bake so long as covered pies.

Shells intended for sweetmeats, must be baked empty, and the fruit
put into them before they go to table.

Fruit pies with lids, should have loaf-sugar grated over them. If
they have been baked the day before, they should be warmed in the
stove, or near the fire, before they are sent to table, to soften
the crust, and make them taste fresh.

Raspberry and apple-pies are much improved by taking off the lid,
and pouring in a little cream just before they go to table.
Replace the lid very carefully.",recipe

  One pound and a half of boiled beef's heart, or fresh
     tongue--chopped when cold.
  Two pounds of beef suet, chopped fine.
  Four pounds of pippin apples, chopped.
  Two pounds of raisins, stoned and chopped.
  Two pounds of currants, picked, washed, and dried.
  Two pounds of powdered sugar.
  One quart of white wine.
  One quart of brandy.
  One wine-glass of rose-water.
  Two grated nutmegs.
  Half an ounce of powdered cinnamon
  A quarter of an ounce of powdered cloves
  A quarter of an ounce of powdered mace
  A teaspoon of salt.
  Two large oranges.
  Half a pound of citron, cut in slips.

Parboil a beef's heart, or a fresh tongue. After you have taken
off the skin and fat, weigh a pound and a half. When it is cold,
chop it very fine. Take the inside of the suet; weigh two pounds,
and chop it as fine as possible. Mix the meat and suet together,
adding the salt. Pare, core, and chop the apples, and then stone
and chop the raisins. Having prepared the currants, add them to
the other fruit, and mix the fruit with the meat and suet. Put in
the sugar and spice, and the grated peel and juice of the oranges.
Wet the whole with the rose water and liquor, and mix all well
together.

The eggs should not be beaten till after all the other ingredients
are ready, as they will fail very soon. If the whites and yolks
are to be beaten separately, do the whites first, as they will
stand longer.

Eggs should be beaten in a broad shallow pan, spreading wide at
the top. Butter and sugar should be stirred in a deep pan with
straight sides.

Break every egg by itself, in a saucer, before you put it into the
pan, that in case there should be any bad ones, they may not spoil
the others.

Eggs are beaten most expeditiously with rods. A small quantity of
white of egg may be beaten with a knife, or a three-pronged fork.


There can be no positive rules as to the exact time of baking each
article. Skill in baking is the result of practice, attention, and
experience. Much, of course, depends on the state of the fire, and
on the size of the things to be baked, and something on the
thickness of the pans or dishes.

pieces. If the weather is very cold, and the butter hard, set the
pan near the fire for a few minutes; but if the butter is too
warm, the cake will be heavy. Stir the butter and sugar together,
with a wooden stick, till they are very light, and white, and look
like cream.

Beat the eggs in a broad shallow pan with a wood egg-beater or
whisk. They must be beaten till they are thick and smooth, and of
the consistence of boiled custard.

Pour the liquor and rose-water, gradually, into the butter and

Butter a large tin pan, or a cake mould with an open tube rising
from the middle. Put the mixture into it as evenly as possible.
Bake it in a moderate oven, for two, or three, or four hours, in
proportion to its thickness, and to the heat of the fire.

When you think it is nearly done, thrust a twig or wooden skewer
into it, down to the bottom. If the stick come out clean and dry,
the cake is almost baked. When quite done, it will shrink from she
sides of the pan, and cease making a noise. Then withdraw the
coals (if baked in a dutch oven), take off the lid, and let the

You may ice it either warm or cold. Before you put the icing on a
large cake, dredge the cake all over with flour, and then wipe the

6677_puffpaste.txt,"PUFF PASTE.

  Half a pound and two ounces of sifted flour.
  Half a pound of the best fresh butter--washed.
  A little cold water.

_This will make puff-paste for two Puddings, or for one
soup-plate Pie, or for four small Shells_.

Weigh half a pound and two ounces of flour, and sift it through a
hair-sieve into a large deep dish. Take out about one fourth of
the flour, and lay it aside on one corner of your pasteboard, to
roll and sprinkle with.

Wash, in cold water, half a pound of the best fresh butter.
Squeeze it hard with your hands and make it up into a round lump.
Divide it in four equal parts; lay them on one side of your
paste-board, and have ready a glass of cold water.

Cut one of the four pieces of butter into the pan of flour. Cut it
as small as possible. Wet it gradually with a very little water
(too much water will make it tough) and mix it well with the point
of a large case-knife. Do not touch it with your hands. When the
dough gets into a lump, sprinkle on the middle of the board some
of the flour that you laid aside, and lay the dough upon it,
turning it out of the pan with the knife.

Rub the rolling-pin with flour, and sprinkle a little on the lump
of paste. Roll it out thin, quickly, and evenly, pressing on the
rolling-pin very lightly. Then take the second of the four pieces
of butter, and, with the point of your knife, stick it in little
bits at equal distances all over the sheet of paste. Sprinkle on
some flour, and fold up the dough. Flour the paste-board and
rolling-pin again; throw a little flour on the paste and roll it
out a second time. Stick the third piece of butter all over it in
little bits. Throw on some flour, fold up the paste, sprinkle a
little more flour on the dough, and on the rolling-pin, and roll
it out a third time, always pressing on it lightly. Stick it over
with the fourth and last piece of butter. Throw on a little more
flour, fold up the paste and then roll it out in a large round
sheet. Cut off the sides, so as to make the sheet of a square
form, and lay the slips of dough upon the square sheet. Fold it up
with the small pieces of trimmings, in the inside. Score or notch
it a little with the knife; lay it on a plate and set it away in a
cool place, but not where it can freeze, as that will make it
heavy.

Having made the paste, prepare and mix your pudding or pie. When
the mixture is finished, bring out your paste, flour the board and
rolling-pin, and roll it out with a short quick stroke, and
pressing the rolling-pin rather harder than while you were putting
the butter in. If the paste rises in blisters, it will be light,
unless spoiled in baking.

Then cut the sheet in half, fold up each piece and roll them out
once more, separately, in round sheets the size of your plate.
Press on rather harder, but not too hard. Roll the sheets thinnest
in the middle and thickest at the edges. If intended for puddings,
lay them in buttered soup-plates, and trim them evenly round the
edges. If the edges do not appear thick enough, you may take the
trimmings, put them all together, roll them out, and having cut
them in slips the breadth of the rim of the plate, lay them all
round to make the paste thicker at the edges, joining them nicely
and evenly, as every patch or crack will appear distinctly when
baked. Notch the rim handsomely with a very sharp knife. Fill the
dish with the mixture of the pudding, and bake it in a moderate
oven. The paste should be of a light brown colour. If the oven is
too slow, it will be soft and clammy; if too quick, it will not
have time to rise as high as it ought to do.

In making the best puff-paste, try to avoid using more flour to
sprinkle and roll with, than the small portion which you have laid
aside for that purpose at the beginning. If you make the dough too
soft at first, by using too much water, it will be sticky, and
require more flour, and will eventually be tough when baked. Do
not put your hands to it, as their warmth will injure it. Use the
knife instead. Always roll from you rather than to you, and press

It is difficult to make puff-paste in the summer, unless in a
cellar, or very cool room, and on a marble table. The butter
should, if possible, be washed the night before, and kept covered
with ice till you use it next day. The water should have ice in
it, and the butter should be iced as it sets on the paste-board.
After the paste is mixed, it should be put in a covered dish, and
set in cold water till you are ready to give it the last rolling.

With all these precautions to prevent its being heavy, it will not
rise as well, or be in any respect as good as in cold weather.

The handsomest way of ornamenting the edge of a pie or pudding is
to cut the rim in large square notches, and then fold over

6677_queencake.txt,"QUEEN CAKE.

  One pound of powdered white sugar.
  One pound of fresh butter--washed.
  Fourteen ounces of sifted flour.
  Ten eggs.
  One wine-glass of wine and brandy, mixed.
  Half a glass of rose-water, or twelve drops of essence of lemon.
  One tea-spoonful of mace and cinnamon, mixed.
  One nutmeg, beaten or grated.

Pound the spice to a fine powder, in a marble mortar, and sift it
well.

Put the sugar into a deep earthen pan, and cut the butter into it.
Stir them together, till very light.

Beat the eggs in a broad shallow pan, till they are perfectly
smooth and thick.

Stir into the butter and sugar a little of the beaten egg, and
then a little flour, and so on alternately, a little egg and a
little flour, till the whole is in; continuing all the time to
beat the eggs, and stirring the mixture very hard. Add by degrees,
the spice, and then the liquor, a little at a time. Finally, put
in the rose-water, or essence of lemon. [Footnote: In buying
essence or oil of lemon, endeavour to get that which is white, it
being much the strongest and best. When it looks greenish, it is
generally very weak, so that when used, a double or treble
quantity is necessary.] Stir the whole very hard at the last.

Take about two dozen little tins, or more, if you have room for
them in the oven. Rub them very well with fresh butter. With a
spoon, put some of the mixture in each tin, but do not fill them
to the top as the cakes will rise high in baking. Bake them in a
quick oven, about a quarter of an hour. When they are done, they
will shrink a little from the sides of the tins.

Before you fill your tins again, scrape them well with a knife,
and wash or wipe them clean.

If the cakes are scorched by too hot a fire, do not scrape off the
burnt parts till they have grown cold.

Make an icing with the whites of three eggs, beaten till it stands
alone, and twenty-four tea-spoonfuls of the best loaf-sugar,
powdered, and beaten gradually into the white of egg. Flavour it
with a tea-spoonful of rose-water or eight drops of essence of
lemon, stirred in at the last. Spread it evenly with a broad
knife, over the top of each queen-cake, ornamenting them, (while
the icing is quite wet) with red and green nonpareils, or fine
sugar-sand, dropped on, carefully, with the thumb and finger.

When the cakes are iced, set them in a warm place to dry; but not
too near the fire, as that will cause the icing to crack.
[Footnote: You may colour icing of a fine pink, by mixing with it
a few drops of liquid cochineal; which is prepared by boiling very
slowly in an earthen or china vessel twenty grains of cochineal
powder, twenty grains of cream of tartar, and twenty grains of
powdered alum, all dissolved in a gill of soft water, and boiled
till reduced to one half. Strain it and cork it up in a small
phial. Pink icing should be ornamented with white nonpareils.]",recipe

  Twelve drops of essence of lemon.

  A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon and mace, mixed.

Beat the eggs as light as possible. Eggs for sponge or almond
cakes require more beating than for any other purpose. Beat the
sugar, by degrees, into the eggs. Beat very hard, and continue to
beat some time after the sugar is all in.

No sort of sugar but loaf will make light sponge-cake. Stir in,
gradually, the spice and essence of lemon. Then, by degrees, put
in the flour, a little at a time, stirring round the mixture very
slowly with a knife. If the flour is stirred in too hard, the cake
will be tough. It must be done lightly and gently, so that the top
of the mixture will be covered with bubbles. As soon as the flour
is all in, begin to bake it, as setting will injure it.

Put it in small tins, well buttered, or in one large tin pan. The
thinner the pans, the better for sponge-cake. Fill the small tins
about half full. Grate loaf-sugar over the top of each, before you
set them in the oven.

Sponge-cake requires a very quick oven, particularly at the
bottom. It should be baked as fast as possible, or it will be
tough and heavy, however light it may have been before it went
into the oven. It is of all cakes the most liable to be spoiled in
baking. When taken out of the tins, the cakes should be spread on
a sieve to cool. If baked in one large cake, it should be iced.

A large cake of twelve eggs, should be baked at least an hour in a
quick oven.

For small cakes, ten minutes is generally sufficient. If they get
very much out of shape in baking, it is a sign that the oven is
too slow.

Some think that sponge-cakes and almond cakes are lighter, when
the yolks and whites of the eggs are beaten in separate pans, and
mixed gently together before the sugar is beaten into them.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS.

In preparing sugar for sweetmeats, let it be entirely dissolved,
before you put it on the fire. If you dissolve it in water, allow
about half a pint of water to a pound of sugar.

If you boil the sugar before you add the fruit to it, it will be
improved in clearness by passing it through a flannel bag. Skim
off the brown scum, all the time it is boiling.

If sweetmeats are boiled too long, they lose their flavour and
become of a dark colour.

If boiled too short a time, they will not keep well.

You may ascertain when jelly is done, by dropping a small spoonful
into a glass of water.

If it spreads and mixes with the water, it requires more boiling.
If it sticks in a lump to the bottom, it is sufficiently done.
This trial must be made after the jelly is cold.

preferring nutmeg, mace, cayenne pepper,--others, black pepper
alone,) add butter and a heaped tea-cup of grated bread; put all
together in the dish; then cover it with your paste, cut in strips,
and crossed, or ornamented as your fancy dictates; a pound of butter

less butter will answer.

A pie of this size will bake in three-quarters of an hour, if the oven
is in good order; if the heat is not quick allow it an hour.

If in baking, the crust is likely to become too brown, put a piece of
paper doubled over it, and the light color will be retained; when taken
from the oven, if it should look dry, pour some of the liquor that was
drained from the oysters in the dish, having previously strained and

9101_roastingmeat.txt,"Roasting Meat.

Roasting either meat or poultry requires more attention than boiling or
stewing; it is very important to baste it frequently, and if the meat
has been frozen, it should have time to thaw before cooking. Beef,
veal, or mutton, that is roasted in a stove or oven requires more flour
dredged on it than when cooked before the fire in a tin kitchen. There
should be but little water in the dripping pan, as that steams the meat
and prevents its browning; it is best to add more as the water
evaporates, and where there is plenty of flour on the meat it
incorporates with the gravy and it requires no thickening; add a little
seasoning before you take up the gravy. Meat that has been hanging up
some time should be roasted in preference to boiling, as the fire
extracts any taste it may have acquired. To rub fresh meat with salt
and pepper will prevent the flies from troubling it, and will make it
keep longer.",recipe

strew over the top of the round a small handful of suet. Be particular
to bind it tight round with a cord, or narrow strip of muslin, which
must be wrapped several times round to keep it in shape; put it in a

too long in the water after it is done, or it is less wholesome. Drain
the water off, if the rice has not absorbed it, and place it in the

In boiling fresh meat, care is necessary to have the water boiling all
the time it is in the pot; if the pot is not well scummed, the
appearance of the meat will be spoiled.

Mutton and beef are preferred, by some, a little rare; but pork and veal
should always be well done. A round of beef that is stuffed, will take
more than three hours to boil, and if not stuffed, two hours or more,
according to the size; slow boiling is the best. A leg of mutton
requires from two to three hours boiling, according to the size; a
fore-quarter from an hour to an hour and a half; a quarter of lamb,
unless, very large, will boil in an hour. Veal and pork will take rather
longer to boil than mutton.

All boiled fresh meat should have drawn butter poured over it, after it
is dished, and be garnished with parsley.

The liquor that fresh meat, or poultry, is boiled in, should be saved,
as an addition of vegetables, herbs, and dumplings make a nourishing
soup of it.

A large turkey will take three hours to boil--a small one half that
time; secure the legs to keep them from bursting out; turkeys should be
blanched in warm milk and water; stuff them and rub their breasts with
butter, flour a cloth and pin them in. A large chicken that is stuffed

It is a mistaken notion, to boil potatoes in but little water, as they
are sure to turn dark and taste strong. In cold weather they may be
kept pared several days in a pan of water, by changing the water every

In the summer when potatoes are young, put them in a small tub, with a
little water, and rub them with a piece of brick, to break the skin; you
can then peel enough for dinner with a knife in a few minutes. When they
are older, boil them with the skins on, and squeeze them separately in a
cloth, to make them mealy. New potatoes are nice with cream and butter

Boil a quart of rich milk. While it is boiling, take a small loaf of
baker’s bread, such as is sold for five or six cents. It may be either
fresh or stale. Pare off all the crust, and cut up the crumb into very
small pieces. You should have baker’s bread if you can procure it, as
home-made bread may not make the pudding light enough. Put the bread
into a pan; and when the milk boils, pour it scalding hot over the
bread. Cover the pan closely, and let it steep in the hot steam for
about three quarters of an hour. Then remove the cover, and allow the
bread and milk to cool. In the mean time, beat four eggs till they are
thick and smooth. Then beat into them a table-spoonful and a half of
fine wheat flour. Next beat the egg and flour into the bread and milk,
and continue to beat hard till the mixture is as light as possible; for
on this the success of the pudding chiefly depends.

Have ready over the fire a pot of boiling water. Dip your pudding-cloth
into it, and shake it out. Spread out the cloth in a deep dish or pan,
and dredge it well with flour. Pour in the mixture, and tie up the
cloth, leaving room for it to swell. Tie the string firmly and plaster
up the opening (if there is any) with flour moistened with water. If
any water gets into it the pudding will be spoiled.

See that the water boils when you put in the pudding, and keep it
boiling hard. If the pot wants replenishing, do it with boiling water
from a kettle. Should you put in cold water to supply the place of that
which has boiled away, the pudding will chill, and become hard and
heavy. Boil it an hour and a half.

Turn it out of the bag the minute before you send it to table. Eat it
with wine sauce, or with sugar and butter, or molasses.

It will be much improved by adding to the mixture half a pound of whole
raisins, well floured to prevent their sinking. Sultana raisins are
best, as they have no seeds.

Boil in half a pint of milk a split vanilla bean, till all the flavour
is extracted. Then strain the milk, and when it is cold stir into it
the yolks of four beaten eggs, and a quarter of a pound of powdered
loaf-sugar.

Simmer this custard five minutes over hot coals, but do not let it come
to a boil. Then set it away to cool. Having boiled an ounce of the best
Russian isinglass in a pint of water till it is entirely dissolved and
the water reduced to one-half, strain it into the custard, stir it
hard, and set it aside to get quite cold.

Whip to a stiff froth a quart of rich cream, taking it off in spoonfuls
as you do it, and putting it to drain on an inverted sieve. When the
custard is quite cold, (but not yet set or congealing,) stir the whipt
cream gradually into it.

Take at circular mould of the shape of a drum, the sides being
straight. Cut to fit it two round slices from the top and bottom of an
almond sponge-cake; glaze them with white of egg, and lay one on at the
bottom of the mould, reserving the other for the top.

Having thus covered the bottom, line the sides of the mould with, more
of the sponge-cake, cut into long squares and glazed all over with
white of egg. They must be placed so as to stand up all round—each
wrapping a little over the other so as to leave not the smallest
vacancy between; and they must be cut exactly the height of the mould,
and trimmed evenly. Then fill up with the custard and cream when it is
just beginning to congeal; and cover the top with the other round slice
of cake.

Set the mould in a tub of pounded ice mixed with coarse salt; and let
it remain forty minutes, or near an hour. Then turn out the Charlotte
on a china dish. Have ready an icing, made in the usual manner of
beaten white of egg and powdered sugar, flavoured with essence of
lemon. Spread it smoothly over the top of the Charlotte, which when the
icing is dry will be ready, to serve. They are introduced at large
parties, and it is usual to have two or four of them.",recipe
9624_achristmasgoosepie.txt,"A CHRISTMAS GOOSE PIE.

These pies are always made with a standing crust. Put into a sauce-pan
one pound of butter cut up, and a pint and a half of water; stir it
while it is melting, and let it come to a boil. Then skim off whatever
milk or impurity may rise to the top. Have ready four pounds of flour
sifted into a pan. Make a hole in the middle of it, and pour in the
melted butter while hot. Mix it with a spoon to a stiff paste, (adding
the beaten yolks of three or four eggs,) and then knead it very well
with your hands, on the paste-board, keeping it dredged with flour till
it ceases to be sticky. Then set it away to cool.

Split a large goose, and a fowl down the back, loosen the flesh all
over with a sharp knife, and take out all the bones. Parboil a smoked
tongue; peel it and cut off the root. Mix together a powdered nutmeg, a
quarter of an ounce of powdered mace, a tea-spoonful of pepper, and a
tea-spoonful of salt, and season with them the fowl and the goose.

Roll out the paste near an inch thick, and divide it into three pieces.
Cut out two of them of an oval form for the top and bottom; and the
other into a long straight piece for the sides or walls of the pie.
Brush the paste all over with beaten white of egg, and set on the
bottom the piece that is to form the wall, pinching the edges together,
and cementing them with white of egg. The bottom piece must be large
enough to turn up a little round the lower edge of the wall piece, to
which it must be firmly joined all round. When you have the crust
properly fixed, so as to be baked standing alone without a dish, put in
first the goose, then the fowl, and then the tongue. Fill up what space
is left with pieces of the flesh of pigeons, or of partridges, quails,
or any game that is convenient. There must be no bones in the pie. You
may add also some bits of ham, or some force-meat balls. Lastly, cover
the other ingredients with half a pound of butter, and pat on the top
crust, which, of course, must be also of an oval form to correspond
with the bottom. The lid must be placed not quite on the top edge of
the wall, but an inch and a half below it. Close it very well, and
ornament the sides and top with festoons and leaves cut out of paste.
Notch the edges handsomely, and put a paste flower in the centre. Glaze
the whole with beaten yolk of egg, and bind the pie all round with a
double fold of white paper. Set it in a regular oven, and bake it four
hours.

This is one way of making the celebrated goose pies that it is
customary in England to send as presents at Christmas. They are eaten
at luncheon, and if the weather is cold, and they are kept carefully
covered up from the air, they will be good for two or three weeks; the

Take the bone out of a round of fresh beef, and beat the meat well all
over to make it tender. Chop and mix together equal quantities of sweet
marjoram and sweet basil, the leaves picked from the stalks and rubbed
fine. Chop also some small onions or shalots, and some parsley; the
marrow from the bone of the beef; and a quarter of a pound, or more of
suet. Add two penny rolls of stale bread grated; and pepper, salt, and
nutmeg to your taste. Mix all these ingredients well, and bind them
together with the beaten yolks of four eggs. Fill with this seasoning
the place from whence you took out the bone; and rub what is left of it
all over the outside of the meat. You must, of course, proportion the
quantity of stuffing to the size of the round of beef. Fasten it well
with skewers, and tie it round firmly with a piece of tape, so as to
keep it compact and in good shape. It is best to prepare the meat the
day before it is to be cooked.

Cover the bottom of a stew-pan with slices of bacon. Lay the beef upon
them, and cover the top of the meat with more slices of bacon. Place
round it four large onions, four carrots, and four turnips, all cut in
thick slices. Pour in from half a pint to a pint of water, and if
convenient, add two calves’ feet cut in half. Cover the pan closely,
set it in an oven and let it bake for at least six hours; or seven or
eight, according to the size.

When it is thoroughly done, take out the beef and lay it on a dish with
the vegetables round it. Remove the bacon and calves’ feet, and (having
skimmed the fat from the gravy carefully) strain it into a small
sauce-pan; set it on hot coals, and stir into it a tea-cupful of port
wine, and the same quantity of pickled mushrooms. Let it just come to a
boil, and then send it to table in a sauce-tureen.

If the beef is to be eaten cold, you may ornament it as follows:— Glaze
it all over with beaten white of egg. Then cover it with a coat of
boiled potato grated finely. Have ready some slices of cold boiled
carrot, and also of beet-root. Cut them into the form of stars or
flowers, and arrange them handsomely over the top of the meat by
sticking them on the grated potato. In the centre place a large bunch
of double parsley, interspersed with flowers cut out of raw turnips,
beets, and carrots, somewhat in imitation of white and red roses, and
marygolds. Fix the flowers on wooden skewers concealed with parsley.

look like a large iced cake decorated with sugar flowers.

9624_applebutter.txt,"APPLE BUTTER.

This is a compound of apples and cider boiled together till of the
consistence of soft butter. It is a very good article on the tea-table,
or at luncheon. It can only be made of sweet new cider fresh from the
press, and not yet fermented.

Fill a very large kettle with cider, and boil it till reduced to one
half the original quantity. Then have ready some fine juicy apples,
pared, cored, and quartered; and put as many into the kettle as can be
kept moist by the cider. Stir it frequently, and when the apples are
stewed quite soft, take them out with a skimmer that has holes in it,
and put them into a tub. Then add more apples to the cider, and stew
them soft in the same manner, stirring them nearly all the time with a
stick. Have at hand some more cider ready boiled, to thin the apple
butter in case you should find it too thick in the kettle.

If you make a large quantity, (and it is not worth while to prepare
apple butter on a small scale,) it will take a day to stew the apples.
At night leave them to cool in the tubs, (which must be covered with
cloths,) and finish next day by boiling the apple and cider again till
the consistence is that of soft marmalade, and the colour a very dark
brown.

Twenty minutes or half an hour before you finally take it from the
fire, add powdered cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to your taste. If the
spice is boiled too long, it will lose its flavour.

When it is cold, put it into stone jars, and cover it closely. If it
has been well made, and sufficiently boiled, it will keep a year or
more.

It must not he boiled in a brass or bell-metal kettle, on account of
the verdigris which the acid will collect in it, and which will render
the apple butter extremely unwholesome, not to say, poisonous.",recipe

To ten gallons of water add six gallons of the best molasses, mixing

Then take out half the liquid, and put it into a tub. Have ready eight
bushels of fine sound apples, pared, cored and quartered. Throw them
gradually into the liquid that is still boiling on the fire. Let it
continue to boil hard, and as it thickens, add by degrees the other
half of the molasses and water, (that which has been put into the tub.)
Stir it frequently to prevent its scorching, and to make it of equal

covering it carefully. Wash out the kettle and wipe it very dry.

Next morning boil the apple butter six or eight hours longer; it should
boil eighteen hours altogether. Half an hour before you take it finally

a paste, made in the proportion of a pound of suet, chopped as fine as
possible, to two pounds and a half of sifted flour, well mixed, and
wetted with as little water as possible. Roll out the paste to a
moderate thickness, and cut it into circular pieces, allowing two
pieces to each dumpling. Lay your apple on one piece, and put another
piece on the top, closing the paste round the sides with your fingers,
so as to cover the apple entirely. This is a better way than gathering
up the paste at one end, as the dumpling is less liable to burst. Boil
each dumpling in a small coarse cloth, which has first been dipped in
hot water. There should always be a set of cloths kept for the purpose.
Tie them tightly, leaving a small space for the dumpling to swell.

Take one peck or two gallons of fine wheat flour, and sift it into a
kneading trough, or into a small clean tub, or a large broad earthen
pan; and make a deep hole in the middle of the heap of flour, to begin
the process by what is called setting a sponge. Have ready half a pint
of warm water, which in summer should be only lukewarm, but even in
winter it must not be hot or boiling, and stir it well into half a pint
of strong fresh yeast; (if the yeast is home-made you must use from
three quarters to a whole pint;) then pour it into the hole in the
middle of the flour. With a spoon work in the flour round the edges of
the liquid, so as to bring in by degrees sufficient flour to form a
thin batter, which must be well stirred about, for a minute or two.
Then take a handful of flour, and scatter it thinly over the top of
this batter, so as to cover it entirely. Lay a warmed cloth over the
whole, and set it to rise in a warm place; in winter put it nearer the
fire than in summer. When the batter has risen so as to make cracks in
the flour on the top, scatter over it three or four table-spoonfuls
(not more) of fine salt, and begin to form the whole mass into a dough;
commencing round the hole containing the batter, and pouring as much
soft water as is necessary to make the flour mix with the batter; the
water must never be more than lukewarm. When the whole is well mixed,
and the original batter which is to give fermentation to the dough is
completely incorporated with it, knead it hard, turning it over,
pressing it, folding it, and working it thoroughly with your clenched
hands for twenty minutes or half an hour; or till it becomes perfectly
light and stiff. The goodness of bread depends much on the kneading,
which to do well requires strength and practice. When it has been
sufficiently worked, form the dough into a lump in the middle of the
trough or pan, and scatter a little dry flour thinly over it; then
cover it, and set it again in a warm place to undergo a farther
fermentation; for which, if all has been done rightly, about twenty
minutes or half an hour will be sufficient. The oven should be hot by
the time the dough has remained twenty minutes in the lump. If it is a
brick oven it should be heated by faggots or small light wood, allowed
to remain in till burnt down into coals. When the bread is ready, clear
out the coals, and sweep and wipe the floor of the oven clean.
Introduce nothing wet into the oven, as it may crack the bricks when
they are hot. Try the heat of the bottom by throwing in some flour; and
if it scorches and burns black, do not venture to put in the bread till
the oven has had time to become cooler. Put the dough on the
paste-board, (which must be sprinkled with flour,) and divide it into
loaves, forming them of a good shape. Place them in the oven, and close
up the door, which you may open once or twice to see how the bread is
going on. The loaves will bake in from two hours and a half to three
hours, or more, according to their size. When the loaves are done, wrap
each in a clean coarse towel, and stand them up on end to cool slowly.
It is a good way to have the cloths previously made damp by sprinkling
them plentifully with water, and letting them lie awhile rolled up
tightly. This will make the crust of the bread less dry and hard. Bread
should be kept always wrapped in a cloth, and covered from the air in a
box or basket with a close lid. Unless you have other things to bake at
the same time, it is not worth while to heat a brick oven for a small
quantity of bread. Two or three loaves can be baked very well in a
stove, (putting them into square iron pans,) or in a Dutch oven.
[Footnote: If you bake bread in a Dutch oven, take off the lid when the
loaf is done, and let it remain in the oven uncovered for a quarter of
an hour.] If the bread has been mixed over night (which should never be
done in warm weather) and is found, on tasting it, to be sour in the
morning, melt a tea-spoonful of pearl-ash in a little milk-warm water,
and sprinkle it over the dough; let it set half an hour, and then knead
it. This will remove the acidity, and rather improve the bread in
lightness. If dough is allowed to freeze it is totally spoiled. All
bread that is sour, heavy, or ill-baked is not only unpalatable, but
extremely unwholesome, and should never be eaten. These accidents so
frequently happen when bread is made at home by careless, unpractised
or incompetent persons, that families who live in cities or towns will
generally risk less and save more, by obtaining their bread from a
professional baker. If you like a little Indian in your wheat bread,
prepare rather a larger quantity of warm water for setting the sponge;
stirring into the water, while it is warming, enough of sifted Indian
meal to make it like thin gruel. Warm water that has had pumpkin boiled
in it is very good for bread. Strong fresh yeast from the brewery
should always be used in preference to any other. If the yeast is
home-made, or not very strong and fresh, double or treble the quantity
mentioned in the receipt will be necessary to raise the bread. On the
other hand, if too much yeast is put in, the bread will be disagreeably
bitter. [Footnote: If you are obliged from its want of strength to put
in a large quantity of yeast, mix with it two or three handfuls of
bran; add the warm water to it, and then strain it through a sieve or
cloth; or you may correct the bitterness by putting in a few bits of
charcoal and then straining it.] You may take off a portion of the
dough that has been prepared for bread, make it up into little round
cakes or rolls, and bake them for breakfast or tea.",recipe

outside of the chickens all over with the egg, and then strew on the

the chickens on it with the inside downwards, or next the fire. Broil
them about three quarters of an hour, keeping them covered with a
plate. Just before you take them up, lay some small pieces of butter on
them.

In preparing chickens for broiling, you may parboil them about ten
minutes, to ensure their being sufficiently cooked; as it is difficult
to broil the thick parts thoroughly without burning the rest.",recipe
9624_broiledham.txt,"BROILED HAM.

Cut the ham into very thin slices, (the thinner the better.) Soak them
in hot water at least half an hour, (a whole hour is better,) to draw
out some of the salt; changing the water several times, and always
pouring it on scalding hot. This process will not only extract the
superfluous salt (which would otherwise ooze out in broiling and remain
sticking about the surface of the meat) but it makes the ham more
tender and mellow. After soaking, dry the slices in a cloth, and then
heat your gridiron, and broil them over a clear fire.

If you have cold boiled ham, it is better for broiling than that which
is raw; and being boiled, will require no soaking before you put it on
the gridiron.

If you wish to serve up eggs with the ham, put some lard into a very
clean frying-pan, and make it boiling hot. Break the eggs separately
into a saucer, that in case a bad one should be among them it may not
mix with the rest. Slip each egg gently into the frying-pan. Do not
turn them while they are frying, but keep pouring some of the hot lard
over them with an iron spoon; this will do them sufficiently on the
upper side. They will be done enough in about three minutes; the white
must retain its transparency so that the yolk will be seen through it.
When done, take them up with a tin slice, drain off the lard, and if
any part of the white is discoloured or ragged, trim it off. Lay a
fried egg upon each slice of the broiled ham, and send them to table
hot.

This is a much nicer way than the common practice of frying the ham or
bacon with the eggs. Some persons broil or fry the ham without eggs,
and send it to table cut into little slips or mouthfuls.

To curl small pieces of ham for garnishing, slice as thin as possible
some that has been boiled or parboiled. The pieces should be about two
inches square. Roll it up round little wooden skewers, and put it into
a cheese toaster, or into a tin oven, and set it before the fire for
eight or ten minutes. When it is done, slip out the skewers.",recipe

9624_calvesfootjelly_illness.txt,"CALVES’ FOOT JELLY.

The best calves’ feet for jelly are those that have had the hair
removed by scalding, but are not skinned; the skin containing a great
deal of glutinous matter. In Philadelphia, unskinned calves’ feet are
generally to be met with in the lower or Jersey market.

Boil a set of feet in four quarts of cold water; (if the feet have been
skinned allow but three quarts;) they should boil slowly till the
liquid is reduced to two quarts or one half the original quantity, and
the meat has dropped in rags from the bone. Then strain the liquid;
measure and set it away in a large earthen pan to get cold; and let it
rest till next morning. Then, if you do not find it a firm cake of
jelly, boil it over again with an ounce of isinglass, and again set it
away till cold and congealed. Remove the sediment from the bottom of
the cake of jelly, and carefully scrape off all the fat. The smallest
bit of fat will eventually render it dull and cloudy. Press some clean
blotting paper all over it to absorb what little grease may yet remain.
Then cut the cake of jelly into pieces, and put it into a porcelain
kettle to melt over the fire. To each quart allow a pound of broken up
loaf-sugar, a pint of Madeira wine, and a large glass of brandy; three
large sticks of the best Ceylon cinnamon broken up, (if common
cinnamon, use four sticks,) the grated peel and juice of four large
lemons; and lastly, the whites of four eggs strained, but not beaten.
In breaking the eggs, take care to separate them so nicely that none of
the yellow gets into the white; as the smallest portion of yolk of egg
will prevent the jelly from being perfectly clear. Mix all the
ingredients well together, and put them to the jelly in the kettle. Set
it on the fire, and boil it hard for twenty minutes, but do not stir
it. Then throw in a tea-cup of cold water, and boil it five minutes
longer; then take the kettle off the fire, and set it aside, keeping it
closely covered for half an hour; this will improve its clearness. Take
a large white flannel jelly-bag; suspend it by the strings to a wooden
frame made for such purposes, or to the legs of a table. Pour in the
mixture boiling hot, and when it is all in, close up the mouth of the
bag that none of the flavour may evaporate. Hang it over a deep white
dish or bowl, and let it drip slowly; but on no account squeeze the
bag, as that will certainly make the jelly dull and cloudy. If it is
not clear the first time, empty the bag, wash it, put in the jelly that
has dripped into the dish, and pass it through again. Repeat this till
it is clear. You may put it into moulds to congeal, setting them in a
cold place. When it is quite firm, wrap a cloth that has been dipped in
hot water, round the moulds to make the jelly turn out easily. But it
will look much better, and the taste will be more lively, if you break
it up after it has congealed, and put it into a glass bowl, or heap it
in jelly glasses Unless it is broken, its sparkling clearness shows to
little advantage.

After the clear jelly has done dripping, you may return the ingredients
to the kettle, and warm them over again for about five minutes. Then
put them into the bag (which you may now squeeze hard) till all the
liquid is pressed out of it into a second dish or bowl. This last jelly
cannot, of course, be clear, but it will taste very well, and may be
eaten in the family.

A pound of the best raisins picked and washed, and boiled with the
other ingredients, is thought by many persons greatly to improve the
richness and flavour or calves’ feet jelly. They must be put in whole,
and can be afterwards used for a pudding.

Similar jelly may be made of pigs’ or sheep’s feet; but it is not so
nice and delicate as that of calves.

By boiling two sets, or eight calves’ feet in five quarts of Water, you
may be sure of having the jelly very firm. In damp weather it is
sometimes very difficult to get it to congeal if you use but one set of
feet; there is the same risk if the weather is hot. In winter it maybe
made several days before it is to be eaten. In summer it will keep in
ice for two days; perhaps longer.",recipe

Take very small cantelopes before they are ripe. Shave a thin paring
off the whole outside. Cut out a small piece or plug about an inch
square, and through it extract all the seeds, &c. from the middle.
Then, return the plugs to the hole from whence you took them, and
secure them with a needle and thread, or by tying a small string round
the cantelope.

Lay the cantelopes for four or five hours in salt and water. Then put
them into spring water to extract the salt, changing the water till you
find it salt no longer. Scald them in weak alum-water. Make a syrup in
the proportion of a pint of water to a pound of loaf-sugar, and boil
the cantelopes in it till a straw will go through them. Then take them
out, and set them in the sun to harden.

Prepare some fine ripe oranges, paring off the yellow rind very thin,
and cutting it into slips, and then laying it in scalding water to
extract the bitterness. Cut the oranges into pieces; allow a pint of
water to each orange, and boil them to a pulp. Afterwards strain them,
and allow to each pint of the liquid, a pound of the best loaf-sugar,
and stir in a little beaten white of egg; one white to four pounds of
sugar. This is for the second syrup. Boil the peel in it, skimming it
well. When the peel is soft, take it all out; for if left among the
cantelopes, it will communicate to it too strong a taste of the orange.

Put the cantelopes into your jars, and pour over them the hot syrup.
Cover them closely, and keep them in a dry cool place.

Large cantelopes may be prepared for preserving (after you have taken
off the outer rind) by cutting them into pieces according to the
natural divisions with which they are fluted. This receipt for
preserving cantelopes whole, will do very well for green lemons or
limes, substituting lemon-peel and lemon-juice for that of oranges in

9624_cheese.txt,"CHEESE.

In making good cheese, skim milk is never used. The milk should either
be warm from the cow or heated to that temperature over the fire. When
the rennet is put in, the heat of the milk should be from 90 to 96
degrees. Three quarts of milk will yield, on an average, about a pound
of cheese. In infusing the rennet, allow a quart of lukewarm water, and
a table-spoonful of salt to a piece about half the size of your hand.
The rennet must soak all night in the water before it can be fit for
use. In the morning (after taking as much of it as you want) put the
rennet water into a bottle and cork it tightly. It will keep the better
for adding to it a wine glass of brandy. If too large a proportion of
rennet is mixed with the milk, the cheese will be tough and leathery.

To make a very good cheese, take three buckets of milk warm from the
cow, and strain it immediately into a large tub or kettle. Stir into it
half a tea-cupful of infusion of rennet or rennet-water; and having
covered it, set it in a warm place for about half an hour, or till it
becomes a firm curd. Cut the curd into squares with a large knife, or
rather with a wooden slitting-dish, and let it stand about fifteen
minutes. Then break it up fine with your hands, and let it stand a
quarter of an hour longer. Then pour off from the top as much of the
whey as you can; tie up the curd in a linen cloth or bag, and hang it
up to drain out the remainder of the whey; setting a pan under it to
catch the droppings. After all the whey is drained out, put the curd
into the cheese-tray, and cut it again into slices; chop it coarse; put
a cloth about it; place it in the cheese-hoop or mould, and set it in
the screw press for half an hour, pressing it hard. [Footnote: If you
are making cheese on a small scale, and have not a regular press, put
the curd (after you have wrapped it in a cloth) into a small circular
wooden box or tub with numerous holes bored in the bottom; and with a
lid that fits the inside exactly. Lay heavy weights on the lid in such
a manner as to press evenly all over.] Then take it out; chop the curd
very fine; add salt to your taste; and put it again into the
cheese-hoop with a cloth about it, and press it again. You must always
wet the cloth all over to prevent its sticking to the cheese, and
tearing the surface. Let it remain in the press till next morning, when
you must take it out and turn it; then wrap it in a clean wet cloth,
and replace it in the press, where it must remain all day. On the
following morning again take out the cheese; turn it, renew the cloth,
and put it again into the press. Three days pressing will be
sufficient.

When you finally take it out of the press, grease the cheese all over
with lard, and put it on a clean shelf in a dry dark room, or in a wire
safe. Wipe, grease, and turn it carefully every day. If you omit this a
single day the cheese will spoil. Keep the shelf perfectly clean, and
see that the cheese does not stick to it. When the cheese becomes firm,
you may omit the greasing; but continue to rub it all over every day
with a clean dry cloth. Continue this for five or sis weeks; the cheese
will then be fit to eat.

The best time for making cheese is when the pasture is in perfection.

You may enrich the colour of the cheese by a little anatto or arnotta;
of which procure a small quantity from the druggist, powder it, tie it
in a muslin rag, and hold it in the warm milk, (after it is strained,)
pressing out the colouring matter with your fingers, as laundresses
press their indigo or blue rag in the tub of water. Anatto is perfectly
harmless.

After they begin to dry, (or ripen, as it is called,) it is the custom
in some dairy-farms, to place the cheeses in the haystack, and keep
them there among the hay for five or six weeks. This is said greatly to

The large carnation cherries are the best for this purpose. They should

leave on the stalks cut short. To each pound of cherries allow a pound
and a quarter of the best loaf-sugar. Spread them on large dishes, and
strew over them a thick layer of the sugar powdered fine; about a
quarter of a pound of sugar to each pound of cherries. Or you may put
them into a large tureen, and disperse the sugar among them, cover
them, and let them set all night. In the morning get some ripe red
currants; pick them, from the stalks, and squeeze them through a linen
cloth till you have just sufficient juice to moisten the remaining
sugar, which you must have ready in a preserving kettle. When the sugar
has melted in the currant juice, put it over the fire, and when it has
been well boiled and skimmed, put in the cherries and simmer them half
an hour, or till they are so clear that you can see the stones through
them. Then take them up one at a time, and spread them out to cool.
Taste one, and if the sugar does not seem, to have sufficiently
penetrated it, return them to the syrup and boil them a little longer,

The fowls for this purpose should be young and fine. You may either
boil or roast them. They must be quite cold. Having removed all the
skin and fat, and disjointed the fowls cut the meat from the bones into
very small pieces, not exceeding an inch. Wash and split two large fine
heads of celery, and cut the white part into pieces also about an inch
long; and having mixed the chicken and celery together, put them into a
deep china dish, cover it and set it away.

It is best not to prepare the dressing till just before the salad is to
be eaten, that it may be as fresh as possible. Have ready the yolks of
eight hard-boiled eggs. Put them into a flat dish, and mash them to a
paste with the back of a wooden spoon. Add to the egg a small
tea-spoonful of fine salt, the same quantity of cayenne pepper, half a
jill of made mustard, a jill or a wine-glass and a half of vinegar, and
rather more than two wine-glasses of sweet oil. Mix all these

is sent in; as by lying in it the chicken and celery will become tough

comes to the top, and pouring in a little cold water when you find the
syrup rising so as to run over the edge of the kettle. It will be well
when it first boils hard to pour in half a pint of cold water to keep
down the bubbles so that the scum may appear, and be easily removed.
You must not however boil it to candy height, so that the bubbles will
look like hard pearls, and the syrup will harden in the spoon and hang
from it in strings; for though very thick and clear it must continue

in a very thin syrup that it may not shrink. Small fruit, such as
raspberries, strawberries, grapes, currants, gooseberries, &c. may, if
perfectly ripe, be put raw into strong cold sugar syrup; they will thus

avoid stirring the soup, as that will injure its clearness.

In the mean time prepare your vegetables. Peel off the outer skin of
three large white onions and slice them. Pare three large turnips, and
slice them also. Wash clean and cut into small pieces three carrots,

clear muslin. Put the vegetables into the soup, and then place the pot
on one side of the fire, where the heat is not so great as in the
middle. Let it boil gently for four hours. Then strain the soup through
a fine towel or linen bag into a large stone pan, but do not squeeze
the bag, or the soup will be cloudy, and look dull instead of clear. In
pouring it into the straining cloth, be careful not to disturb the
ingredients at the bottom of the soup-pot.

stiff froth, and then mix it gradually with the soup. Set it over the
fire, and stir it till it boils briskly. Then take it off, and set it
beside the fire to settle for ten minutes. Strain it then through a
clean napkin, and it will be fit for use. But it is better to have the

hoop, or mould, which for this purpose should be about half a foot
deep, and as large round as a dinner plate—first spreading a clean wet
cloth under the curd, and folding it (the cloth) over the top. Lay a
large brick on it, or something of equivalent weight, and let the whey
drain gradually out through the holes at the bottom of the mould. It
must not be pressed hard, as when finished a cream cheese should be
only about the consistence of firm butter. The curd will sink gradually
in the mould till the whole mass will be about two or three inches
thick. Let it remain in the mould six hours, by which time the whey
should cease to exude from it. Otherwise, it must be left in somewhat

9624_directionsforcuringhamorbacon.txt,"DIRECTIONS FOR CURING HAM OR BACON.

Ham or bacon, however well cured, will never be good unless the pork of
which it is made has been properly fed. The hogs should be well
fattened on corn, and fed with it about eight weeks, allowing ten
bushels to each hog. They are best for curing when from two to four
years old, and should not weigh more than one hundred and fifty or one
hundred and sixty pounds. The first four weeks they may be fed on mush,
or on Indian meal moistened with water; the remaining four on corn
unground; giving them always as much as they will eat. Soap-suds may be
given to them three or four times a week; or oftener if convenient.

When killed and cut up, begin immediately to salt them. Rub the outside
of each ham with a tea-spoonful of powdered saltpetre, and the inside
with a tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper. Having mixed together brown
sugar and fine salt, in the proportion of a pound and a half of brown
sugar to a quart of salt, rub the pork well with it. This quantity of
sugar and salt will be sufficient for fifty pounds of meat. Have ready
some large tubs, the bottoms sprinkled with salt, and lay the meat in
the tubs with the skin downward. Put plenty of salt between each layer
of meat. After it has lain eight days, take it out and wipe off all the
salt, and wash the tubs. Make a pickle of soft water, equal quantities
of salt and molasses, and a little saltpetre; allowing four ounces of
saltpetre to two quarts of molasses and two quarts of salt, which is
the proportion for fifty pounds of meat. The pickle must be strong
enough to bear up an egg. Boil and skim it; and when it is cold, pour
it over the meat, which must be turned every day and basted with the
pickle. The hams should remain in the pickle at least four weeks; the
shoulders and middlings of the bacon three weeks; and the jowls two
weeks. They should then be taken out and smoked. Having washed off the
pickle, before you smoke the meat, bury it, while wet, in a tub of
bran. This will form a crust over it, and prevent evaporation of the
juices. Let the smoke-house be ready to receive the meat immediately.
Take it out of the tub after it has lain half an hour, and rub the bran
evenly over it. Then hang it up to smoke with the small end downwards.
The smoke-house should be dark and cool, and should stand alone, for
the heat occasioned by an adjoining—building may spoil the meat, or
produce insects. Keep up a good smoke all day, but have no blaze.
Hickory is the best wood for a smoke-house fire, In three or four weeks
the meat will be sufficiently smoked, and fit for use. During the
process it should be occasionally taken down, examined, and hung up
again. The best way of keeping hams is to wrap them in paper, or, to
sew them in coarse cloths (which should be white-washed) and bury them
in a barrel of hickory ashes. The ashes must be frequently changed.

one.

four days, turning them all over every day. Then take them out, wash
each thing separately in vinegar, and wipe them carefully in a cloth.
Afterwards lay them on sieves before the fire and dry them thoroughly.

For the pickle liquor.—To every two quarts of the best vinegar, put an
ounce and a half of white ginger root, scraped and sliced; the same of
long pepper; two ounces of peeled shalots, or little button-onions, cut
in pieces; half an ounce of peeled garlic; an ounce of-turmeric; and
two ounces of mustard seed bruised, or of mustard powder. Let all these
ingredients, mixed with the vinegar, infuse in a close jar for a week,
setting in a warm place, or by the fire. Then (after the vegetables
have been properly prepared, and dried from the brine) put them all
into one large stone jar, or into smaller jars, and strain the pickle
over them. The liquid must be in a large quantity, so as to keep the
vegetables well covered with it, or they will spoil. Put a
table-spoonful of sweet oil on the top of each jar, and secure them
well with a large cork and a leather.

If you find that after awhile the vegetables have absorbed the liquor,
so that there is danger of their not having a sufficiency, prepare some
more seasoned vinegar and pour it over them.

East India pickle is very convenient, and will keep two years. As
different vegetables come into season, you can prepare them with the
salt and water process, and add them to the things already in the jar.

9624_familysoup.txt,"FAMILY SOUP.

Take a shin or leg of beef that has been newly killed; the fore leg is
best, as there is the most meat on it. Have it cut into three pieces,
and wash it well. To each pound allow somewhat less than a quart of
water; for instance, to ten pounds of leg of beef, nine quarts of water
is a good proportion. Put it into a large pot, and add half a
table-spoonful of salt. Hang it over a good fire, as early as six
o’clock in the morning, if you dine at two. When it has come to a hard
boil, and the scum has risen, (which it will do as soon as it has
boiled,) skim it well. Do not remove the lid more frequently than is
absolutely necessary, as uncovering the pot causes the flavour to
evaporate. Then set it on hot coals in the corner, and keep it
simmering steadily, adding fresh coals so as to continue a regular
heat.

About nine o’clock, put in four carrots, one parsnip, and a large onion
cut into slices, and four small turnips, and eight tomatas, also cut
up; add a head of celery cut small. Put in a very small head of
cabbage, cut into little pieces. If you have any objection to cabbage,
substitute a larger proportion of the other vegetables. Put in also a
bunch of sweet marjoram, tied up in a thin muslin rag to prevent its
floating on the top.

Let the soup simmer unceasingly till two o’clock, skimming it well:
then take it up, and put it into a tureen. If your dinner hour is
later, you may of course begin the soup later; but it will require at
least eight hours’ cooking; remembering to put in the vegetables three
hours after the meat.

If you wish to send the meat to table, take the best part of it out of
the soup, about two hours before dinner. Have ready another pot with a
dozen tomatas and a few cloves. Moisten them with a little of the soup,
just sufficient to keep them from burning. When the tomatas have stewed
down soft, put the meat upon them, and let it brown till dinner time
over a few coals, keeping the pot closely covered; then send it to
table on a dish by itself. Let the remainder of the meat be left in the
large pot till you send up the soup, as by that time it will be boiled
to rags and have transferred all its flavour to the liquid.

This soup will be greatly improved by the addition of a few dozen
ochras cut into very thin slices, and put in with the other vegetables.
You may put Lima beans into it, green peas, or indeed any vegetables
you like: or you may thicken it with ochras and tomatas only.

Next day, take what is left of the soup, put it into a pot, and simmer
it over hot coals for half an hour: a longer time will weaken the
taste. If it has been well made and kept in a cool place, it will be
found better the second day than the first.

If your family is very small, and the leg of beef large, and the season
winter, it may furnish soup for four successive days. Cut the beef in
half; make soup of the first half, in the manner above directed, and
have the remainder warmed next day; then on the third day make fresh
soup of the second half.

We have been minute in these directions; for if strictly followed, the
soup, though plain, will be found excellent.

If you do not intend to serve up the meat separately, break to pieces
all the bones with a mallet or kitchen cleaver. This, by causing them
to give out their marrow, &c., will greatly enrich the liquid. Do this,
of course, when you first begin the soup.

FINE BEEF SOUP.

Begin this soup the day before it is wanted. Take a good piece of fresh
beef that has been newly killed: any substantial part will do that has
not too much fat about it: a fore leg is very good for this purpose.
Wash it well. Cut off all the meat, and break up the bones. Put the
meat and the bones into a large pot, very early in the day, so as to
allow eight or nine hours for its boiling. Proportion the water to the
quantity of meat—about a pint and a half to each pound. Sprinkle the
meat with a small quantity of pepper and salt. Pour on the water, hang
it over a moderate fire, and boil it slowly; carefully skimming off all
the fat that rises to the top, and keeping it closely covered, except
when you raise the lid to skim it. Do not, on any account, put in
additional water to this soup while it is boiling; and take care that
the boiling goes steadily on, as, if it stops, the soup will be much
injured. But if the fire is too great, and the soup boils too fast, the
meat will become hard and tough, and will not give out its juices.

After the meat is reduced to rags, and the soup sufficiently boiled,
remove the pot from the fire, and let it stand in the corner for a
quarter of an hour to settle. Then take it up, strain it into a large
earthen pan, cover it, and set it away in a cool dry place till next
day. Straining it makes it clear and bright, and frees it from the
shreds of meat and bone. If you find that it jellies in the pan, (which
it will if properly made,) do not disturb it till you are ready to put
it into the pot for the second boiling, as breaking the jelly may
prevent it from keeping well.

On the following morning, boil separately, carrots, turnips, onions,
celery, and whatever other vegetables you intend to thicken the soup
with. Tomatas will greatly improve it. Prepare them by taking off the
skin, cutting them into small pieces, and stewing them in their own
juice till they are entirely dissolved. Put on the carrots before any
of the other vegetables, as they require the longest time to boil. Or
you may slice and put into the soup a portion of the vegetables you are
boiling for dinner; but they must be nearly done before you put them
in, as the second boiling of the soup should not exceed half an hour,
or indeed, just sufficient time to heat it thoroughly.

Scrape off carefully from the cake of jellied soup whatever fat or
sediment may still be remaining on it; divide the jelly into pieces,
and about half an hour before it is to go to table, put it into a pot,
add the various vegetables, (having first sliced them,) in sufficient
quantities to make the soup very thick; hang it over the fire and let
it boil slowly, or simmer steadily till dinner time. Boiling it much on
the second day will destroy the flavour, and render it flat and
insipid. For this reason, in making fine, clear beef soup, the
vegetables are to be cooked separately. They need not be put in the
first day, as the soup is to be strained; and on the second day, if put
in raw, the length of time required to cook them would spoil the soup
by doing it too much. We repeat, that when soup has been sufficiently
boiled on the first day, and all the juices and flavour of the meat
thoroughly extracted, half an hour is the utmost it requires on the
second.

Carefully avoid seasoning it too highly. Soup, otherwise excellent, is
frequently spoiled by too much pepper and salt. These condiments can be
added at table, according to the taste of those that are eating it; but
if too large a proportion of them is put in by the cook, there is then
no remedy, and the soup may by some be found uneatable.

Many persons prefer boiling all the vegetables in the soup on the first
day, thinking that they improve its flavour. This may be done in common
soup that is not to be strained, but is inadmissible if you wish it to
be very bright and clear. Also, unless you have a garden and a
profusion of vegetables of your own, it is somewhat extravagant, as
when strained out they are of no further use, and are therefore wasted.",recipe

To every pound of the best fresh butter allow a pound or a quart of
superfine flour. Sift the flour into a deep pan, and then sift on a
plate some additional flour to use for sprinkling and rolling. Wash the
butter through two cold waters; squeezing out all the salt, and
whatever milk may remain in it; and then make it up with your hands
into a round lump, and put it in ice till you are ready to use it. Then
divide the butter into four equal parts. Cut up one of the quarters
into the pan of flour; and divide the remaining three quarters into six
pieces, [Footnote: Or into nine; and roll it in that number of times.]
cutting each quarter in half. Mix with a knife the flour and butter
that is in the pan, adding by degrees a very little cold water till you
have made it into a lump of stiff dough. Then sprinkle some flour on
the paste-board, (you should have a marble slab,) take the dough from
the pan by lifting it out with the knife, lay it on the board, and
flouring your rolling-pin, roll out the paste into a large thin sheet.
Then with the knife, put all over it, at equal distances, one of the
six pieces of butter divided into small bits. Fold up the sheet of
paste, flour it, roll it out again, and add in the same manner another
of the portions of butter. Repeat this process till the butter is all
in. Then fold it once more, lay it on a plate, and set it in a cool
place till you are ready to use it. Then divide it into as many pieces
as you want sheets of paste; roll out each sheet, and put them into
buttered plates or patty-pans. In using the rolling-pin, observe always
to roll from you. Bake the paste in a moderate oven, but rather quick
than slow. No air must be admitted to it while baking.

The edges of paste should always be notched before it goes into the
oven. For this purpose, use a sharp penknife, dipping it frequently in
flour as it becomes sticky. The notches should be even and regular. If
you do them imperfectly at first, they cannot be mended by sticking on
additional bits of paste; as, when baked, every patch will be doubly
conspicuous. There are various ways of notching; one of the neatest is
to fold over one corner of each notch; or you may arrange the notches
to stand upright and lie flat, alternately, all round the edge. They
should be made small and regular. You may form the edge into leaves
with the little tin cutters made for the purpose.

If the above directions for puff paste are carefully followed, and if
it is not spoiled in baking, it will rise to a great thickness and
appear in flakes or leaves according to the number of times you have
put in the butter.

smooth; flavouring it as you proceed with a few drops of oil of lemon,
or a little extract of roses. Spread it evenly over the cake with a
broad knife or a feather; if you find it too thin, beat in a little
more powdered sugar. Cover with it thickly the top and sides of the

requires skill and practice. When the icing is about half dry, put on
the ornaments. You may flower it with coloured sugar-sand or nonparels;

To lard meat or poultry is to introduce into the surface of the flesh,
slips of the fat only of bacon, by means of a larding-pin or
larding-needle, it being called by both names. It is a steel instrument
about a foot long, sharp at one end, and cleft at the other into four
divisions, which are near two inches in length, and resemble tweezers.
It can be obtained at the hardware stores.

Cut the bacon into slips about two inches in length, half an inch in
breadth, and half an inch in thickness. If intended for poultry, the
slips of bacon should not be thicker than a straw. Put them, one at a
time, into the cleft or split end of the larding-needle. Give each slip
a slight twist, and press it down hard into the needle with your
fingers. Then push the needle through the flesh, (avoiding the places
where the bones are,) and when you draw it out it will have left behind
it the slip of bacon sticking in the surface. Take care to have all the
slips of the same size, and arranged in regular rows at equal
distances. Every slip should stand up about an inch. If any are wrong,
take them out and do them over again. To lard handsomely and neatly

Have ready two quarts of very rich thick cream, and take out a pint.
Stir gradually into the pint, a pound of the best loaf-sugar powdered
fine; and the grated rind and the juice of four ripe lemons of the
largest size, or of five or six smaller ones. If you cannot procure the
fruit, you may flavour the cream with essence or oil of lemon; a
tea-spoonful or more, according to its strength. The strongest and best
essence of lemon is the white or whitish; when tinged with green, it is
comparatively weak, having been diluted with water; if quite green, a
large tea-spoonful will not communicate as much flavour as five or six
drops of the white. After you have mixed the pint of cream with the
sugar and lemon, beat it gradually and hard into the remaining cream,
that is, the three pints. Cover it, and let it stand to infuse from
half an hour to an hour. Then taste it, and if you think it necessary,
stir in a little more lemon juice or a little more sugar. Strain it
into the freezer through a fine strainer, (a tin one with small close
holes is best,) to get rid of the grated lemon-peel, which if left in
would prevent the cream from being smooth. Cover the freezer, and stand
it in the ice cream tub, which should be filled with a mixture, in
equal quantities, of coarse salt, and ice broken up as small as
possible, that it may lie close and compact round the freezer, and thus
add to its coldness. Snow, when it can be procured, is still better
than ice to mix with the salt. It should be packed closely into the
tub, and pressed down hard. Keep turning the freezer about by the
handle till the cream is frozen, which it will generally be in two
hours. Occasionally open the lid and scrape down the cream from the
sides with a long-handled tin spoon. Take care that no salt gets in, or
the cream will be spoiled. When it is entirely frozen, take it out of
the freezer and put it into your mould; set it again in the tub, (which
must be filled with fresh ice and salt,) and leave it undisturbed till
you want it for immediate use. This second freezing, however, should
not continue longer than two hours, or the cream will become
inconveniently and unpleasantly hard, and have much of the flavour
frozen out of it. Place the mould in the ice tub, with the head
downwards, and cover the tub with pieces of old carpet while the second
freezing is going on. When it has arrived at the proper consistence,
and it is time to serve it up, dip a cloth in hot water, and wrap it
round the mould for a few moments, to loosen the cream and make it come
out easily; setting the mould on a glass or china dish. If a pyramid or
obelisk mould, lift it carefully off the top. If the mould or form
represents doves, dolphins, lap-dogs, fruit baskets, &c. it will open
down the middle, and must be taken off in that manner. Serve it up
immediately lest it begin to melt. Send round sponge-cake with it, and
wine or cordials immediately after.

If you have no moulds, but intend serving it up in a large bowl or in
glasses, it must still be frozen twice over; otherwise it can have no
smoothness, delicacy, or consistence, but will be rough and coarse, and
feel in the mouth like broken icicles. The second freezing (if you have
no mould) must be done in the freezer, which should be washed out, and
set again in the tub with fresh ice and salt. Cover it closely, and let
the cream stand in it untouched, but not less than two hours. When you
put it into glasses, heap it high on the top.

Begin to make ice cream about five or six hours before it is wanted for
use. If you commence it too early, it may probably be injured by having
to remain too long in the second freezing, as it must not be turned out
till a few moments before it is served up. In damp weather it requires
a longer time to freeze.

then add, for each quart, two table-spoonfuls of powdered arrow-root
rubbed smooth in a little cold milk. Orange ice cream is made in the

9624_mushrooms.txt,"MUSHROOMS.

Good mushrooms are only found in clear open fields where the air is
pure and unconfined. Those that grow in low damp ground, or in shady
places, are always poisonous. Mushrooms of the proper sort generally
appear in August and September, after a heavy dew or a misty night.
They may be known by their being of a pale pink or salmon colour on the
gills or under side, while the top is of a dull pearl-coloured white;
and by their growing only in open places. When they are a day old, or a
few hours after they are gathered, the reddish colour changes to brown.

The poisonous or false mushrooms are of various colours, sometimes of a
bright yellow or scarlet all over; sometimes entirely of a chalky white
stalk, top, and gills.

It is easy to detect a bad mushroom if all are quite fresh; but after
being gathered a few hours the colours change, so that unpractised
persons frequently mistake them.

It is said that if you boil an onion among mushrooms the onion will
turn of a bluish black when there is a bad one among them. Of course,
the whole should then be thrown into the fire. If in stirring
mushrooms, the colour of the silver spoon is changed, it is also most
prudent to destroy them all.",recipe

9624_pies.txt,"PIES.

Pies may be made with any sort of paste. It is a fault to roll it out
too thin; for if it has not sufficient substance, it will, when baked,
be dry and tasteless. For a pie, divide the paste into two sheets;
spread one of them over the bottom and sides of a deep dish well
buttered. Next put in the fruit or other ingredients, (heaping it
higher in the centre,) and then place the other sheet of paste on the
top as a lid or cover; pressing the edges closely down, and afterwards
crimping or notching them with a sharp small knife.

In making pies of juicy fruit, it is well to put on the centre of the
under crust a common tea-cup, laying the fruit round it and over it.
The juice will collect under the cup, and not be liable to run out from
between the edges. There should be plenty of sugar strewed among the
fruit as you put it into the pie.

Preserves should never be put into covered pies. The proper way is to
lay them in baked shells.

All pies are best the day they are baked. If kept twenty-four hours the
paste falls and becomes comparatively hard, heavy, and unwholesome. If
the fruit is not ripe, it should be stewed with sugar, and then allowed
to get cold before it is put into the pie. If put in warm it will make

Take four pigeons and stuff them with chopped oysters, seasoned with
pepper, salt, mace, and nutmeg. Score the breasts, and loosen all the
joints with a sharp knife, as if you were going to carve them for

While they are cooling, prepare your sugar, which must be fine loaf.
Allow a pound of sugar to every quart of whole raspberries. Having
washed the kettle clean, put the sugar into it, allowing half a pint of

Having pared off the green skin, cut the rind of a water-melon into
pieces of any shape you please; stars, diamonds, circles, crescents or

allow to each pound a pound and a halt of loaf sugar. Set the sugar
aside, and put the pieces of melon-rind into a preserving kettle, the
bottom and sides of which you, have lined with green vine leaves. Put a
layer of vine leaves between each, layer of melon-rind, and cover the
top with leaves. Disperse among the pieces some very small bits of
alum, each about the bigness of a grain of corn, and allowing one bit
to every pound of the melon-rind. Pour in just water enough to cover
the whole, and place a thick double cloth (or some other covering) over
the top of the kettle to keep in the steam, which will improve the
greening. Let it simmer (but not boil) for two hours. Then take out the
pieces of melon-rind and spread them on dishes to cool. Afterwards if
you find that they taste of the alum, simmer them in very weak ginger
tea for about three hours. Then proceed to make your syrup. Melt the
sugar in clear spring or pump water, allowing a pint of water to a
pound and a half of sugar, and mixing in with it some white of egg
beaten to a stiff froth. The white of one egg will be enough for four
pounds of sugar. Boil and skim it; and when the scum ceases to rise,
put in the melon-rind, and let it simmer an hour. Take it out and
spread it to cool on dishes return it to the syrup, and simmer it
another hour. After this take it out, and put it into a tureen. Boil up
the syrup again, and pour it over the melon-rind. Cover it, and let it
stand all night. Next morning give the syrup another boil; adding to It
some lemon-juice, allowing the juice of one lemon to a quart of the
syrup. When you find it so thick as to hang in a drop on the point of
the spoon, it is sufficiently done. Then put the rind into glass jars,
pour in the syrup, and secure the sweetmeats closely from the air with
paper dipped in brandy, and a leather outer cover.

This, if carefully done and well greened, is a very nice sweetmeat, and
may be used to ornament the top of creams, jellies, jams by laying it

It is best to defer making this sweetmeat (which will be found very
fine) till late in the season when lemons are ripe and are to be had in
plenty. Pumpkins (as they keep well) can generally be procured at any
time through the winter.

Take a fine pumpkin, of a rich deep colour, pare off the outer rind;
remove the seeds; and having sliced the best part, cut it into chips of
equal size, and about as thick as a half dollar. They should be in long
narrow pieces, two inches in breadth, and six in length. It is best to
prepare the pumpkin the day before; and having weighed the chips, allow
to each pound of them a pound of the best loaf-sugar. You must have
several dozen of fine ripe lemons, sufficient to furnish a jill of
lemon-juice to each pound of pumpkin. Having rolled them under your
hand on a table, to make them yield as much juice as possible, pare off
the yellow rind and put it away for some other purpose. Then having cut
the lemons, squeeze out all the juice into a pitcher. Lay the pumpkin
chips in a large pan or tureen, strewing the sugar among them. Then
having measured the lemon-juice in a wine-glass, (two common
wine-glasses making one jill,) pour it over the pumpkin and sugar,
cover the vessel, and let it stand all night.

Next day transfer the pumpkin, sugar, and lemon-juice to n preserving
kettle, and boil it slowly three quarters of an hour, or till the
pumpkin becomes all through tender, crisp, and transparent; but it must
not be over the fire long enough to break and lose its form. You must
skim it thoroughly. Some very small pieces of the lemon-paring may be
boiled with it. When you think it is done, take up the pumpkin chips in
a perforated skimmer that the syrup may drain through the holes back
into the kettle. Spread the chips to cool on large dishes, and pass the
syrup through a flannel bag that has been first dipped in hot water.
When the chips are cold, put them into glass jars or tumblers, pour in
the syrup, and lay on the top white paper dipped in brandy. Then tie up
the jars with leather, or with covers of thick white paper.

If you find that when cold the chips are not perfectly clear, crisp,
and tender, give them another boil in the syrup before you put them up.

This, if well made, is a handsome and excellent sweetmeat It need not
be eaten with cream, the syrup being so delicious as to require nothing
to improve it. Shells of puff-paste first baked empty, and then filled
with, pumpkin chips, will be found very nice.

stir them into the mixture; adding six drops of extract of roses, or a
large table-spoonful of rose water. Add a wine glass and a half of the
best fresh yeast from a brewery. If you cannot procure yeast of the
very best quality, an attempt to make these buns will most probably
prove a failure, as the variety of other ingredients will prevent them
from rising unless the yeast is as strong as possible. Before you put
it in, skim off the thin liquid or beer from the top, and then stir up
the bottom. After you have put in the yeast, add the sugar; stirring it
well in, a very little at a time. If too much sugar is put in at once,
the buns will be heavy. Lastly, sprinkle in the quarter of a pound of
flour that was sifted separately; and stir the whole very hard. Put the
mixture into a square pan well buttered, and (having covered it with a
cloth) place it in a corner of the hearth to rise, which will require,
perhaps, about five hours; therefore these buns should always be made
early in the day. Do not bake it till the batter has risen to twice its
original quantity, and is covered on the top with bubbles; then set the
pan into a moderate oven, and bake it about twenty minutes. Let it get
cool in the pan; then, cut it into squares, and either ice them,
(flavouring the icing with essence of lemon or extract of roses,) or
sift grated loaf-sugar thickly over them. These buns (like all other
cakes made with yeast) should be eaten the day they are baked; as when
stale, they fall and become hard.

In mixing them, you may stir in at the last half a pound of raisins,
stoned, chopped and floured; or half a pound of currants. If you use
fruit, put in half a wine glass more of the yeast.",recipe

the yellow rind and squeeze into a saucer the juice of three lemons.
Beat twelve eggs; and when they are as light as possible, beat into
them gradually and very hard the sugar, adding the lemon, and beating
the whole for a long time. Then by degrees, stir in the flour slowly
and lightly; for if the flour is stirred hard and fast into sponge
cake, it will make it porous and tough. Have ready buttered, a
sufficient number of little square tins, (the thinner they are the
better,) half fill them with the mixture; grate loaf-sugar over the top
of each; put them immediately into a quick oven, and bake them about
ten minutes; taking out one to try when you think they are done. Spread
them on an inverted sieve to cool. When baked in small square cakes,
they are generally called Naples biscuits.

If you are willing to take the trouble, they will bake much nicer in
little square paper cases, which you must make of a thick letter paper,
turning up the sides all round, and pasting together or sewing up the
corners.

If you bake the mixture in one large cake, (which is not advisable
unless you have had much practice in baking,) put it into a buttered
tin pan or mould, and set it directly into a hot Dutch oven, as it will
fall and become heavy if allowed to stand. Keep plenty of live coals on
the top, and under the bottom till the cake has risen very high, and is
of a fine colour; then diminish the fire, and keep it moderate till the
cake is done. It will take about an hour. When cool, ice it; adding a

Having strained the morning’s milk, and skimmed the cream from the milk

has formed, you must not break it up, (as is done with other cheese,)
but take it out all at once with a wooden skimming dish, and place it
on a sieve to drain gradually. While it is draining, keep pressing it
gently till it becomes firm and dry. Then lay a clean cloth at the
bottom of a wooden cheese-hoop or mould, which should have a few small
holes bored in the bottom. The cloth must be large enough for the end
to turn over the top again, after the curd is put in. Place it in the
press for two hours; turn it, (putting a clean cloth under it,) and
press it again for six or eight hours. Then turn it again, rub the
cheese all over with salt, and return it to the press for fourteen
hours. Should the edges of the cheese project, they must be pared off.

When you take it finally out of the press, bind it round tightly with a
cloth, (which must be changed every day when you turn the cheese,) and
set it on a shelf or board. Continue the cloths till the cheese is firm
enough to support itself; rubbing or brushing the outside every day
when you turn it. After the cloths are left off, continue to brush the
cheese every day for two or three months; during which time it may be
improved by keeping it covered all round, under and over, with grass,
which must be renewed every day, and gathered when quite dry after the
dew is off. Keep the cheese and the grass between two large plates.

Take a large fresh tongue, rub it with a mixture, in equal proportions,
of salt, brown sugar, and powdered cloves. Cover it, and let it lie two
days, or at least twenty-four hours. Then boil it two hours, and when,
it is cold, skin it, and mince it very fine. Chop also three pounds of
beef suet, six pounds of sultana raisins, and six pounds of the best
pippin apples that have been previously pared and cored. Add three
pounds of currants, picked, washed and dried; two large table-spoonfuls
of powdered cinnamon; the juice and grated rinds of four large lemons;
one pound of sweet almonds, one ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and
pounded in a mortar with half a pint of rose water; also four powdered
nutmegs; two dozen beaten cloves; and a dozen blades of mace powdered.
Add a pound of powdered white sugar, and a pound of citron cut into
slips. Mix all together, and moisten it with a quart of Madeira, and a
pint of brandy. Put it up closely in a stone jar with brandy paper; and

9624_thebestpaste.txt,"THE BEST PLAIN PASTE.

All paste should be made in a very cool place, as heat renders it
heavy. It is far more difficult to get it light in summer than in
winter. A marble slab is much better to roll it on than a paste-board.
It will be improved in lightness by washing the butter in very cold
water, and squeezing and pressing out all the salt, as salt is
injurious to paste. In New York and in the Eastern states, it is
customary, in the dairies, to put more salt in what is called fresh
butter, than in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. This butter,
therefore, should always undergo the process of washing and squeezing
before it is used for pastry or cakes. None but the very best butter
should be taken for those purposes; as any unpleasant taste is always
increased by baking. Potted butter never makes good paste. As pastry is
by no means an article of absolute necessity, it is better not to have
it at all, than to make it badly, and of inferior ingredients; few
things being more unwholesome than hard, heavy dough. The flour for
paste should always be superfine.

You may bake paste in deep dishes or in soup plates. For shells that
are to be baked empty, and afterwards filled with stewed fruit or
sweetmeats, deep plates of block tin with broad edges are best. If you
use patty-pans, the more flat they are the better. Paste always rises
higher and is more perfectly light and flaky, when unconfined at the
sides while baking. That it may be easily taken out, the dishes or tins
should be well buttered.

To make a nice plain paste,—sift three pints of superfine flour, by
rubbing it through a sieve into a deep pan. Divide a pound of fresh
butter into four quarters. Cut up one quarter into the flour, and rub
it fine with your hands. Mix in, gradually, as much cold water as will
make a tolerably stiff dough, and then knead it slightly. Use as little
water as possible or the paste will be tough. Sprinkle a little flour
on your paste-board, lay the lump of dough upon it, and knead it a very
short time. Flour it, and roll it out into a very thin sheet, always
rolling from you. Flour your rolling-pin to prevent its sticking. Take
a second quarter of the butter, and with your thumb, spread it all over
the sheet of paste. If your hand is warm, use a knife instead of your
thumb; for if the butter oils, the paste will be heavy. When you have
put on the layer of butter, sprinkle it with a very little flour, and
with your hands roll up the paste as you would a sheet of paper. Then
flatten it with a rolling-pin, and roll it out a second time into a
thin sheet. Cover it with another layer of butter, as before, and again
roll it up into a scroll. Flatten it again, put on the last layer of
butter, flour it slightly, and again roll up the sheet. Then cut the
scroll into as many pieces as you want sheets for your dishes or
patty-pans. Roll out each piece almost an inch thick. Flour your
dishes, lay the paste lightly on them, notch the edges, and bake it a
light brown. The oven must be moderate. If it is too hot, the paste
will bake before it has risen sufficiently. If too cold, it will
scarcely rise at all, and will be white and clammy. When you begin to
make paste in this manner, do not quit it till it is ready for the
oven. It must always be baked in a close oven where no air can reach
it.

The best rolling-pins, are those that are straight, and as thick at the
ends as in the middle. They should be held by the handles, and the
longer the handles the more convenient. The common rolling-pins that
decrease in size towards the ends, are much less effective, and more
tedious, as they can roll so little at a time; the extremities not
pressing on the dough at all.

All, pastry is best when fresh. After the first day it loses much of
its lightness, and is therefore more unwholesome.",recipe

9624_toboilaham.txt,"TO BOIL A HAM.

Hams should always be soaked in water previous to boiling, to draw out
a portion of the salt, and to make them tender. They will soften more
easily if soaked in lukewarm water. If it is a new ham, and not very
salt or hard, you need not put it in water till the evening before you
intend to cook it. An older one will require twenty-four hours’
soaking; and one that is very old and hard should be kept in soak two
or three days, frequently changing the water, which must be soft. Soak
it in a tub, and keep it well covered. When you take it out of the
water to prepare it for boiling, scrape and trim it nicely, and pare
off all the bad looking parts.

Early in the morning put it into a large pot or kettle with plenty of
cold water. Place it over a slow fire that it may heat gradually; it
should not come to a boil in less than an hour and a half, or two
hours. When it boils, quicken the fire, and skim the pot carefully.
Then simmer it gently four or fire hours or more, according to its
size. A ham weighing fifteen pounds should simmer five hours after it
has come to a boil. Keep the pot well skimmed.

When it is done, take it up, carefully strip off the skin, and reserve
it to cover the ham when it is put away cold. Rub the ham all over with
some beaten egg, and strew on it fine bread-raspings shaken through the
lid of a dredging box. Then place it in an oven to brown and crisp, or
on a hot dish set over the pot before the fire. Cut some writing paper
into a handsome fringe, and twist it round the shank-bone before you
send the ham to table. Garnish the edge of the dish with little piles
or spots of rasped crust of bread.

In carving a ham, begin not quite in the centre, but a little nearer to
the hock. Cut the slices very thin. It is not only a most ungenteel
practice to cut ham in thick slices, but it much impairs the flavour.

When you put it away after dinner, skewer on again the skin. This will
make it keep the better.

Ham should always be accompanied by green vegetables, such as
asparagus, peas, beans, spinach, cauliflower, brocoli, &c.

Bacon also should be well soaked before it is cooked; and it should be
boiled very slowly, and for a long time. The greens may be boiled with
the meat. Take care to skim the pot carefully, and to drain and squeeze
the greens very well before you send them to table. If there are yellow
streaks in the lean of the bacon, it is rusty, and unfit to eat.",recipe

the livers and gizzards to the sides, under the wings. Dredge them with

In buying dried tongues, choose those that are thick and plump, and
that have the smoothest skins. They are the most likely to be young and

A smoked tongue should soak in cold water at least all night. One that
is very hard and dry will require twenty-four hours’ soaking. When you
boil it put it into a pot full of cold water. Set it over a slow fire
that it may heat gradually for an hour before it comes to a boil. Then
keep it simmering from three and a half to four hours, according to its
size and age. Probe it with a fork, and do not take it up till it is
tender throughout. Send it to table with mashed potato laid round it,
and garnish with parsley. Do not split it in half when you dish it, as
is the practice with some cooks. Cutting it lengthways spoils the
flavour, and renders it comparatively insipid.

If you wish to serve up the tongue very handsomely, rub it with yolk of
egg after you take it from the pot, and strew over it grated bread
crumbs; baste it with butter, and set it before the fire till it

three inches below the green part. To serve up asparagus with long
stalks is now becoming obsolete. As you scrape them, throw them into a

The day previous to that on which it is to be eaten, take the fish

The best piece is the round. You may either boil it whole, or divide it
into two, or even three pieces if it is large, taking care that each
piece shall have a portion of the fat. Wash it well; and, if very salt,
soak it in two waters. Skewer it up tightly and in a good compact
shape, wrapping the flap piece firmly round it. Tie it round with broad
strong tape, or with a strip of coarse linen. Put it into a large pot,
and cover it well with water. It will be found a convenience to lay it
on a fish drainer.

Hang it over a moderate fire that it may heat gradually all through.
Carefully take off the scum as it rises, and when no more appears, keep
the pot closely covered, and let it boil slowly and regularly, with the
fire at an equal temperature. Allow three hours and a half to a piece
weighing about twelve pounds, and from that to four or five hours in
proportion to the size. Turn the meat twice in the pot while it is
boiling. Put in some carrots and turnips about two hours after the
meat. Many persons boil cabbage in the same pot with the beef, but it
is a much nicer way to do the greens in a separate vessel, lest they
become saturated with the liquid fat. Cauliflower or brocoli (which are
frequent accompaniments to corned beef) should never be boiled with it.

Wash the cabbage in cold water, removing the outside leaves, and
cutting the stalk close. Examine all the leaves carefully, lest insects
should be lodged among them. If the cabbage is large, divide it into
quarters. Put it into a pot of boiling water with a handful of salt,
and boil it till the stalk is quite tender. Half an hour will generally
be sufficient for a small young cabbage; an hour for a large full-grown
one. Drain it well before you dish it. If boiled separately from the
meat, have ready some melted butter to eat with it.

Should you find the beef under-done, you may reboil it next day;
putting it into boiling-water and letting it simmer for half an hour or
more, according to its size.

Cold corned beef will keep very well for some days wrapped in several
folds of a thick linen cloth, and set away in a cool dry place.

In carving a round of beef, slice it horizontally and very thin. Do not
help any one to the outside pieces, as they are generally too hard and
salt. French mustard is very nice with corned beef. [Footnote: French
mustard is made of the very best mustard powder, diluted with vinegar,
and flavoured with minced tarragon leaves, and a minced clove of
garlic; all mixed with a wooden spoon.]

This receipt will apply equally to any piece of corned beef, except
that being less solid than the round, they will, in proportion to their
weight, require rather less time to boil.

In dishing the meat, remove the wooden skewers and substitute plated or
silver ones.

Many persons think it best (and they are most probably right) to stew
corned beef rather than to boil it. If you intend to stew it, put no
more water in the pot than will barely cover the meat, and keep it

your gridiron well, and as soon as it is hot lay the shad upon it, and
broil it for about a. quarter of an hour or more, according to the

9624_tobroilbeefsteaks.txt,"TO BROIL BEEF-STEAKS.

The best beef-steaks are those cut from the ribs or from the inside of
the sirloin. All other parts are for this purpose comparatively hard
and tough.

They should be cut about three quarters of an inch thick, and, unless
the beef is remarkably fine and tender, the steaks will be much
improved by beating them on both sides with a steak mallet, or with a
rolling-pin. Do not season them till you take them from the fire.

Have ready on your hearth a fine bed of clear bright coals, entirely
free from smoke and ashes. Set the gridiron over the coals in a
slanting direction, that the meat may not be smoked by the fat dropping
into the fire directly under it. When the gridiron is quite hot, rub
the bars with suet, sprinkle a little salt over the coals, and lay on
the steaks. Turn them frequently with a pair of steak-tongs, or with a
knife and fork. A quarter of an hour is generally sufficient time to
broil & beef-steak. For those who like them under-done or rare, ten or
twelve minutes will be enough.

When the fat blazes and smokes very much as it drips into the fire,
quickly remove the gridiron for a moment, till the blaze has subsided.
After they are browned, cover the upper side of the steaks with an
inverted plate or dish to prevent the flavour from evaporating. Rub a
dish with a shalot or small onion, and place it near the gridiron and
close to the fire, that it may be well heated. In turning the steak
drop the gravy that may be standing on it into this dish, to save it
from being lost. When the steaks are done, sprinkle them with a little
salt and pepper, and lay them in a hot dish, putting on each a piece of
fresh butter. Then, if it is liked, season them with, a very little raw
shalot, minced as finely as possible, and moistened with a spoonful of
water; and stir a tea-spoonful of catchup into the gravy. Send the

9624_tokeepeggs.txt,"TO KEEP EGGS.

There is no infallible mode of ascertaining the freshness of an egg
before you break it, but unless an egg is perfectly good, it is unfit
for any purpose whatever, and will spoil whatever it is mixed with. You
may judge with tolerable accuracy of the state of an egg by holding it
against the sun or the candle, and if the yolk, as you see it through
the shell, appears round, and the white thin and clear, it is most
probably a good one; but if the yolk looks broken, and the white thick
and cloudy, the egg is certainly bad. You may try the freshness of eggs
by putting them into a pan of cold water. Those that sink the soonest
are the freshest; those that are stale or addled will float on the
surface.

There are various ways of preserving eggs. To keep them merely for
plain boiling, you may parboil them for one minute, and then bury them
in powdered charcoal with their small ends downward. They will keep a
few days in ajar of salt; but do not afterwards use the salt in which
they have been immersed.

They are frequently preserved for two or three months by greasing them
all over, when quite fresh, with melted mutton suet, and then wedging
them close together (the small end downwards) in a box of bran, layer
above layer; the box must be closely covered.

Another way (and a very good one) is to put some lime in a large
vessel, and slack it with boiling water, till it is of the consistence
of thin cream; you may allow a gallon of water to a pound of lime. When
it is cold, pour it off into a large stone jar, put in the eggs, and
cover the jar closely. See that the eggs are always well covered with
the lime-water, and lest they should break, avoid moving the jar. If
you have hens of your own, keep a jar of lime-water always ready, and
put in the eggs as they are brought in from the nests. Jars that hold
about six quarts are the most convenient.

9624_tomakebutter.txt,"TO MAKE BUTTER.

Scald your milk pans every day after washing them; and let them set
till the water gets cold. Then wipe them with a clean cloth. Fill them
all with cold water half an hour before milking time, and do not pour
it out till the moment before you are ready to use the pans. Unless all
the utensils are kept perfectly sweet and nice, the cream and butter
will never be good. Empty milk-pans should stand all day in the sun.

When you have strained the milk into the pans, (which should be broad
and shallow,) place them in the spring-house, setting them down in the
water. After the milk has stood twenty-four hours, skim off the cream,
and deposits it in a large deep earthen jar, commonly called a crock,
which must be kept closely covered, and stirred up with a stick at
least twice a day, and whenever you add fresh cream to it. This
stirring is to prevent the butter from being injured by the skin that
will gather over the top of the cream.

You should churn at least twice a week, for if the cream is allowed to
stand too long, the butter will inevitably have a odd taste. Add to the
cream the strippings of the milk. Butter of only two or three days
gathering is the best. With four or five good cows, you may easily
manage to have a churning every three days. If your dairy is on a large
scale, churn every two days.

Have your churn very clean, and rinse and cool it with cold water. A
barrel churn is best; though a small upright one, worked by a staff or
dash, will do very well where there are but one or two cows.

Strain the cream from the crock into the churn, and put on the lid.
Move the handle slowly in warm weather, as churning too fast will make
the butter soft. When you find that the handle moves heavily and with
great difficulty, the butter has come; that is, it has separated from
the thin fluid and gathered into a lump, and it then is not necessary
to churn any longer. Take it out with a wooden ladle, and put it into a
small tub or pail. Squeeze and press it hard with the ladle, to get out
all that remains of the milk. Add a little salt, and then squeeze and
work It for a long time. If any of the milk is allowed to remain in, it
will speedily turn sour and spoil the butter. Set it away in a cool
place for three hours, and then work it over again. [Footnote: A marble
slab or table will be found of great advantage in working and making up
butter.] Wash it in cold water; weigh it; make it up into separate
pounds, smoothing, and shaping it; and clap each pound on your wooden
butter print, dipping the print every time in cold water. Spread a
clean linen cloth on a bench in the spring-house; place the butter on
it, and let it set till it becomes perfectly hard. Then wrap each pound
in a separate piece of linen that has been dipped in cold water.

Pour the buttermilk into a clean crock, and place it in the
spring-house, with a saucer to dip it out with. Keep the pot covered.
The buttermilk will be excellent the first day; but afterwards it will
become too thick and sour. Winter buttermilk is never very palatable.

Before you put away the churn, wash and scald it well; and the day that
you use it again, keep it for an hour or more filled with cold water.

In cold weather, churning is a much more tedious process than in
summer, as the butter will be longer coming. It is best then to have
the churn in a warm room, or near the fire. If you wish to prepare the
butter for keeping a long time, take it after it has been thoroughly
well made, and pack it down tightly into a large jar. You need not in
working it, add more salt than if the butter was to be eaten
immediately. But preserve it by making a brine of fine salt, dissolved
in water. The brine must be strong enough to bear up an egg on the
surface without sinking. Strain the brine into the jar, so as to be
about two inches above the butter. Keep the jar closely covered, and
set it in a cool place.

When you want any of the butter for use, take it off evenly from the
top; so that the brine may continue to cover it at a regular depth.

This receipt for making butter is according to the method in use at the
best farm-houses in Pennsylvania, and if exactly followed will be found
very good. The badness of butter is generally owing to carelessness or
mismanagement; to keeping the cream too long without churning; to want
of cleanliness in the utensils; to not taking the trouble to work it
sufficiently; or to the practice of salting it so profusely as to
render it unpleasant to the taste, and unfit for cakes or pastry. All
these causes of bad butter are inexcusable, and can easily be avoided.
Unless the cows have been allowed to feed where there are bitter weeds
or garlic, the milk cannot naturally have any disagreeable taste, and
therefore the fault of the butter must be the fault of the maker. Of
course, the cream is much richer where the pasture is fine and
luxuriant; and in winter, when the cows have only dry food, the butter
must be consequently whiter and more insipid than in the grazing
season. Still, if properly made, even winter butter cannot taste badly.

Many economical housekeepers always buy for cooking, butter of inferior
quality. This is a foolish practice; as when it is bad, the taste will
predominate through all attempts to disguise it, and render every thing
unpalatable with which it is combined. As the use of butter is designed
to improve and not to spoil the flavour of cookery, it is better to
omit it altogether, and to substitute something else, unless you can
procure that which is good. Lard, suet, beef-drippings, and sweet oil,
may be used in the preparation of various dishes; and to eat with bread
or warm cakes, honey, molasses, or stewed fruit, &c, are far superior
to bad butter.",recipe

9624_tomakecoffee.txt,"TO MAKE COFFEE.

The manner in which coffee is roasted is of great importance to its
flavour. If roasted too little, it will be weak and insipid; if too
much, the taste will be bitter and unpleasant. To have it very good, it
should be roasted immediately before it is made, doing no more than the
quantity you want at that time. It loses much of its strength by
keeping, even in twenty-four hours after roasting. It should on no
consideration be ground till directly before it is made. Every family
should be provided with a coffee roaster, which is an iron cylinder to
stand before the fire, and is either turned by a handle, or wound up
like a jack to go of itself. If roasted in an open pot or pan, much of
the flavour evaporates in the process. Before the coffee is put into
the roaster, it should be carefully examined and picked, lest there
should be stones or bad grains among it. It should be roasted of a
bright brown; and will be improved by putting among it a piece of
butter when about half done.

Watch it carefully while roasting, looking at it frequently.

A coffee-mill affixed to the wall is far more convenient than one that
must he held on the lap. It is best to grind the coffee while warm.

Allow half a pint of ground coffee to three pints of water. If the
coffee is not freshly roasted, you should put in more. Put the water
into the tin coffee-pot, and set it on hot coals; when it boils, put in
the coffee, a spoonful at a time, (stirring it between each spoonful,)
and add two or three chips of isinglass, or the white of an egg. Stir
it frequently, till it has risen up to the top in boiling; then set it
a little farther from the fire, and boil it gently for ten minutes, or
a quarter of an hour; after which pour in a tea-cup of cold water, and
put it in the corner to settle for ten minutes. Scald your silver or
china pot, and transfer the coffee to it; carefully pouring it off from
the grounds, so as not to disturb them.

If coffee is allowed to boil too long, it will lose much of its
strength, and also become sour.",recipe
9624_tomaketea.txt,"TO MAKE TEA.

In buying tea, it is best to get it by the box, of an importer, that
you may be sure of having it fresh, and unmixed with any that is old
and of inferior quality. The box should be kept in a very dry place. If
green tea is good, it will look green in the cup when poured out. Black
tea should be dark coloured and have a fragrant flowery smell. The best
pots for making tea are those of china. Metal and Wedgwood tea-pots by
frequent use will often communicate a disagreeable taste to the tea.
This disadvantage may be remedied in Wedgwood ware, by occasionally
boiling the tea-pots in a vessel of hot water.

In preparing to make tea, let the pot be twice scalded from the
tea-kettle, which must be boiling hard at the moment the water is
poured on the tea; otherwise it will be weak and insipid, even when a
large quantity is put in. The best way is to have a chafing dish, with
a kettle always boiling on it, in the room where the tea is made. It is
a good rule to allow two tea-spoonfuls of tea to half a pint or a large
cupful of water, or two tea-spoonfuls for each grown person that is to
drink tea, and one spoonful extra. The pot being twice scalded, put in
the tea, and pour on the water about ten minutes before you want to
fill the cups, that it may have time to draw or infuse. Have hot water
in another pot, to weaken the cups of those that like it so. That the
second course of cups may be as strong as the first, put some tea into
a cup just before you sit down to table, pour on it a very little
boiling water, (just enough to cover it,) set a saucer over it to keep
in the steam, and let it infuse till you have filled all the first
cups; then add it to that already in the tea-pot, and pour in a little
boiling water from the kettle. Except that it is less convenient for a
large family, a kettle on a chafing dish is better than an urn, as the
water may be kept longer boiling.

In making black tea, use a larger quantity than of green, as it is of a
much weaker nature. The best black teas in general use are pekoe and
pouchong; the best green teas are imperial, young hyson, and gunpowder.",recipe

the tomatas in layers; sprinkling between each layer (which, should be
about two inches in thickness) a half pint of salt. Repeat this till
you have put in eight quarts or one peck of tomatas. Cover the tub and
let it set for three days. Then early in the morning, put the tomatas

thin syrup barely sufficient to cover the fruit. In making this syrup
allow a pound of fine loaf-sugar to every quart of water, and half the
white of a beaten egg; all to be mixed before it goes on the fire. Then
boil and skim it, and when the scum ceases to rise, put in the
pine-apples, and simmer them slowly an hour. Then take them out to
cool, cover them carefully and pat them away till next day; saving the
syrup in another vessel. Next day, put them into the same syrup, and
simmer them again an hour. On the third day, repeat the process. The
fourth day, make a strong fresh syrup, allowing but a pint of water to
each pound of sugar, and to every three pounds the beaten white of one
egg. When this syrup has boiled, and is completely skimmed, put in the
pine-apples, and simmer them half an hour. Then take them out to cool,
and set them aside till next morning. Boil them again, half an hour in
the same syrup, and repeat this for seven or eight days, or till you
can pierce through the pine-apple with a straw from a corn-broom. At

half a pint to each pound of sugar. Beat some white of egg, (one white
to four pounds of sugar,) and when it is a very stiff froth, stir it
gradually into the water. Then mix with it the pine-apple and sugar,

9624_topicklebeefortongues.txt,"TO PICKLE BEEF OR TONGUES.

The beef must be fresh killed, and of the best kind. You must wipe
every piece well, to dry it from the blood and moisture. To fifty
pounds of meat allow two pounds and a quarter of coarse salt, two
pounds and a quarter of fine salt, one ounce and a half of saltpetre,
one pound and a half of brown sugar, and one quart of molasses. Mix all
these ingredients well together, boil and skim it for about twenty
minutes, and when no more scum rises, take it from the fire. Have ready
the beef in a large tub, or in a barrel; pour the brine gradually upon
it with a ladle, and as it cools rub it well into every part of the
meat. A molasses hogshead sawed in two is a good receptacle for pickled
meat. Cover it well with a thick cloth, and look at it frequently,
skimming off whatever may float on the top, and basting the meat with
the brine. In about a fortnight the beef will be fit for use.

Tongues may be put into the same cask with the beef, one or two at a
time, as you procure them from the butcher. None of them will be ready
for smoking in less than six weeks; but they had best remain in pickle
two or three months. They should not be sent to the smoke-house later
than March. If you do them at home, they will require three weeks’
smoking over a wood fire. Hang them with the root or large end upwards.
When done, sew up each tongue tightly in coarse linen, and hang them up
in a dark dry cellar.

Pickled tongues without smoking are seldom liked.

The last of October is a good time for putting meat into pickle. If the
weather is too warm or too cold, it will not take the salt well.

In the course of the winter the pickle may probably require a second
boiling with additional ingredients.

Half an ounce of pearl-ash added to the other articles will make the
meat more tender, but many persons thinks it injures the taste.

These nuts are in the best state for pickling when the shell is soft,
and when they are so young that the outer skin can be penetrated by the

If you have a large quantity, the easiest way to prepare them for
pickling is to put them into a tub with sufficient lye to cover them,
and to stir and rub them about with a hickory broom, till they are
clean and smooth on the outside. This is much less trouble than
scraping them, and is not so likely to injure the nuts. Another method
is to scald them, and then to rub off the outer skin. Put the nuts into
strong salt and water for nine or ten days; changing the water every
other day, and keeping them closely covered from the air. Then drain

large needle,) and prepare the pickle as follows:—For a hundred large
nuts, take of black pepper and ginger root of each an ounce; and of
cloves, mace and nutmeg of each a half ounce. Pound all the spices to

ginger, pour the syrup over it, cover it, and do not disturb it for two
days. Then, having poured it from the ginger, boil the syrup over
again. As soon as it is cold, pour it again on the ginger, and let it
stand at least three days. Afterwards boil the syrup again, and pour it
_hot_ over the ginger. Proceed in this manner till you find that the
syrup has thoroughly penetrated the ginger, (which you may ascertain by
its taste and appearance when you cut a piece off,) and till the syrup
becomes very thick and rich. Then put it all into jars, and cover it
closely.

If you put the syrup hot to the ginger at first, it will shrink and
shrivel. After the first time, you have only to boil and reboil the
syrup; as it is not probable that it will require any further
clarifying if carefully skimmed. It will be greatly improved by adding
some lemon-juice at the close of the last boiling.",recipe
9624_topreservegooseberries.txt,"TO PRESERVE GOOSEBERRIES.

The best way of preserving gooseberries is with jelly. They should be
full grown but green. Take six quarts of gooseberries, and select three
quarts of the largest and finest to preserve whole, reserving the
others for the jelly. Put the whole ones into a pan with sufficient
water to cover them, and simmer them slowly till they begin to be
tender; but do not keep them on the fire till they are likely to burst.
Take them out carefully with a perforated skimmer to drain the warm
water from them, and lay them directly in a pan of cold water. Put
those that you intend for the jelly into a stew-pan, allowing to each
quart of gooseberries half a pint of water. Boil them fast till they go
all to pieces, and stir and mash them with a spoon. Then put them into
a jelly-bag that has been first dipped in hot water, and squeeze
through it all the juice. Measure the juice, and to each pint allow a
pound and a half of loaf-sugar. Break up the sugar, and put it into a
preserving kettle; pour the juice over it, and let it stand to melt,
stirring it frequently. When it has all dissolved, set it over the
fire, put the gooseberries into it, and let them boil twenty minutes,
or till they are quite clear, and till the jelly is thick and congeals
in the spoon when you hold it in the air. If the gooseberries seem
likely to break, take them out carefully, and let the jelly boil by
itself till it is finished. When all is done, put up the gooseberries
and the jelly together in glass jars.

Strawberries, raspberries, grapes, currants or any small fruit may in a
similar manner be preserved in jelly.",recipe

stuffing (it must be quite full) and then sew it up, or tie it round
with a buttered twine. Put the pig on the spit, and place it before a
clear brisk fire, but not too near lest it scorch. The fire should be
largest at the ends, that the middle of the pig may not be done before
the extremities. If you find the heat too great in the centre, you may
diminish it by placing a flat-iron before the fire. When you first put
it down, wash the pig all over with salt and water; afterwards rub it
frequently with a feather dipped in sweet oil, or with fresh butter
tied in a rag. If you baste it with any thing else, or with its own
dripping, the skin will not be crisp. Take care not to blister or burn
the outside by keeping it too near the fire. A good sized pig will
require at least three hours’ roasting.

Unless a pig is very small it is seldom sent to table whole. Take the
spit from the fire, and place it across a large dish: then, having cut
off the head with a sharp knife, and cut down the back, slip the spit
out. Lay the two halves of the body close together in the dish, and
place half the head on each side. Garnish with sliced lemon.

For the gravy,—take, that from the dripping-pan and skim it well.
Having boiled the heart, liver, and feet, with some minced sage in a
very little water, cut the meat from the feet, and chop it. Chop also
the liver and heart. Put all into a small sauce-pan, adding a little of
the water that they were boiled in, and some bits of butter rolled in
flour. Flavour it with a glass of Madeira, and some grated nutmeg. Give
it a boil up, and send it to table in a gravy-boat.

You may serve up with the pig, apple-sauce, cranberry sauce, or
bread-sauce in a small tureen; or currant jelly.

If you bake the pig instead of roasting it, rub it from time to time
with fresh butter tied in a rag.",recipe

Wipe it all over with a sponge dipped in warm water Then rub the skin
with lard or nice dripping. Cover the fat with sheets of paper two
double, buttered, and tied on with packthread that has been soaked to
keep it from burning. Or, what is still better, you may cover the first
sheets of paper with a coarse paste of flour and water rolled out half
an inch thick, and then cover the paste with the second sheets of
paper, securing the whole well with the string to prevent its falling
off. Place the venison on the spit before a strong clear fire, such as
you would have for a sirloin of beef, and let the fire be well kept up
all the time. Put some claret and butter into the dripping-pan and
baste the meat with it frequently. If wrapped in paste, it will not be
done in less than five hours. Half an hour before you take it up,
remove the coverings carefully, place the meat nearer to the fire,
baste it with fresh butter and dredge it very lightly with flour. Send
it to table with fringed white paper wrapped round the bone, and its
own gravy well skimmed. Have currant jelly to eat with it. As venison
chills immediately, the plates should be kept on heaters.

You may make another gravy with a pound and a half of scraps and
trimmings or inferior pieces of venison, put into a sauce-pan with
three pints of water, a few cloves, a few blades of mace, half a
nutmeg; and salt and cayenne to your taste. Boil it down slowly to a
pint. Then skim off the fat, and strain the gravy into a clean
sauce-pan. Add to it half a pint of currant jelly, half a pint of
claret, and near a quarter of a pound of butter divided into bits and
rolled in flour. Send it to table in two small tureens or sauce-boats.
This gravy will be found very fine.

Venison should never be roasted unless very fat. The shoulder is a
roasting piece, and may be done without the paper or paste.

Venison is best when quite fresh; but if it is expedient to keep it a
week before you cook it, wash it well with milk and water, and then dry
it perfectly with cloths till there is not the least damp remaining on
it. Then mix together powdered ginger and pepper, and rub it well over
every part of the meat. Do not, however, attempt to keep it unless the
weather is quite cold.",recipe

Make a force-meat of grated bread-crumbs, minced suet, sweet marjoram,
grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, pepper, salt, and beaten yolk of egg. You
may add some grated cold ham. Light some writing paper, and singe the
hairs from the skin of the turkey. Reserve the neck, liver, and gizzard
for the gravy. Stuff the craw of the turkey with the force-meat, of
which there should be enough made to form into balls for frying, laying
them round the turkey when it is dished. Dredge it with flour, and
roast it before a clear brisk fire, basting it with cold lard. Towards
the last, set the turkey nearer to the fire, dredge it again very
lightly with flour, and baste it with butter. It will require,
according to its size, from two to three hours roasting.

Make the gravy of the giblets cut in pieces, seasoned, and stewed for
two hours in a very little water; thicken it with a spoonful of browned
flour, and stir into it the gravy from the dripping-pan, having first
skimmed off the fat.

A turkey should be accompanied by ham or tongue. Serve up with it
mushroom-sauce. Have stewed cranberries on the table to eat with it. Do
not help any one to the legs, or drum-sticks as they are called.

Turkeys are sometimes stuffed entirely with sausage-meat. Small cakes
of this meat should then be fried, and laid round it.

To bone a turkey, you must begin with a very sharp knife at the top of
the wings, and scrape the flesh loose from the bone without dividing or
cutting it to pieces. If done carefully and dexterously, the whole mass
of flesh may be separated from the bone, so that you can take hold of
the head and draw out the entire skeleton at once. A large quantity of
force-meat having been prepared, stuff it hard into the turkey,
restoring it by doing so to its natural form, filling out the body,
breast, wings and legs, so as to resemble their original shape when the
bones were in. Roast or bake it; pouring a glass of port wine into the
gravy. A boned turkey is frequently served up cold, covered with lumps
of currant jelly; slices of which are laid round the dish.

Any sort of poultry or game may be boned and stuffed in the same
manner,

A cold turkey that has not been boned is sometimes sent to table larded
all over the breast with slips of fat bacon, drawn through the flesh
with a larding needle, and arranged in regular form.",recipe
9624_toroastbeef.txt,"TO ROAST BEEF.

The fire should be prepared at least half an hour before the beef is
put down, and it should be large, steady, clear, and bright, with
plenty of fine hot coals at the bottom.

The best apparatus for the purpose is the well-known roaster frequently
called a tin-kitchen.

Wash the meat in cold water, and then wipe it dry, and rub it with
salt. Take care not to run the spit through the best parts of it. It is
customary with some cooks to tie blank paper over the fat, to prevent
it from melting and wasting too fast.

Put it evenly into the roaster, and do not set it too near the fire,
lest the outside of the meat should be burned before the inside is
heated.

Put some nice beef-dripping or some lard into the pan or bottom of the
roaster, and as soon as it melts begin to baste the beef with it;
taking up the liquid with a long spoon, and pouring it over the meat so
as to let it trickle down again, into the pan. Repeat this frequently
while it is roasting; after a while you can baste it with its own fat.
Turn the spit often, so that the meat may be equally done on all sides.

Once or twice draw back the roaster, and improve the fire by clearing
away the ashes, bringing forward the hot coals, and putting on fresh
fuel at the back. Should a coal fall into the dripping-pan take it out
immediately. An allowance of about twenty minutes to each pound of meat
is the time commonly given for roasting; but this rule, like most
others, admits of exceptions according to circumstances. Also, some
persons like their meat very much done; others prefer it rare, as it is
called. In summer, meat will roast in a shorter time than in winter.

When the beef is nearly done, and the steam draws towards the fire,
remove the paper that has covered the fat part, sprinkle on a little
salt, and having basted the meat well with the dripping, pour off
nicely (through the spout of the roaster) all the liquid fat from the
top of the gravy.

Lastly, dredge the meat very lightly with a little flour, and baste it
with fresh butter. This will give it a delicate froth. To the gravy
that is now running from the meat add nothing but a tea-cup of boiling
water. Skim it, and send it to table in a boat. Serve up with the beef
in a small deep plate, scraped horseradish moistened with vinegar.

Fat meat requires more roasting than lean, and meat that has been
frozen will take nearly double the usual time.

Basting the meat continually with flour and water is a bad practice, as
it gives it a coddled parboiled appearance, and diminishes the flavour.

These directions for roasting beef will apply equally to mutton.

Pickles are generally eaten with roast beef. French mustard is an
excellent condiment for it. In carving begin by cutting a slice from
the side.",recipe
9624_toroastchesnuts.txt,"TO ROAST CHESTNUTS.

The large Spanish chestnuts are the best for roasting. Cut a slit in

9624_toroastlamb.txt,"TO ROAST LAMB.

The best way of cooking lamb is to roast it; when drest otherwise it is
insipid, and not so good as mutton. A hind-quarter of eight pounds will
be done in about two hours; a fore-quarter of ten pounds, in two hours
and a half; a leg of five pounds will take from an hour and a quarter
to an hour and a half; a loin about an hour and a half. Lamb, like veal
and pork, is not eatable unless thoroughly done; no one preferring it
rare, as is frequently the case with beef and mutton.

Wash the meat, wipe it dry, spit it, and cover the fat with paper.
Place it before a clear brisk fire. Baste it at first with a little
salt and water, and then with its own drippings. Remove the paper when
the meat is nearly done, and dredge the lamb with a little flour.
Afterwards baste it with butter. Do not take it off the spit till you
see it drop white gravy.

Prepare some mint sauce by stripping from the stalks the leaves of
young green mint, mincing them very fine, and mixing them with vinegar
and sugar. There must be just sufficient vinegar to moisten the mint,
but not enough to make the sauce liquid. Send it to table in a boat,
and the gravy in another boat. Garnish with sliced lemon.

In carving a quarter of lamb, separate the shoulder from the breast, or
the leg from the ribs, sprinkle a little salt and pepper, and squeeze
on some lemon juice.

It should be accompanied by asparagus, green peas, and lettuce.

9624_toroastmutton.txt,"TO ROAST MUTTON.

Mutton should be roasted with a quick brisk fire. Every part should be
trimmed off that cannot be eaten. Wash the meat well. The skin should
be taken off and skewered on again before the meat is put on the spit;
this will make it more juicy. Otherwise tie paper over the fat, having
soaked the twine in water to prevent the string from burning. Put a
little salt and water into the dripping-pan, to baste the meat at
first, then use its own gravy for that purpose. A quarter of an hour
before you think it will be done, take off the skin or paper, dredge
the meat very lightly with flour, and baste it with butter. Skim the
gravy and send it to table in a boat. A leg of mutton will require from
two hours roasting to two hours and a half in proportion to its size. A
chine or saddle, from two hours and a half, to three hours. A shoulder,
from an hour and a half, to two hours. A loin, from an hour and three
quarters, to two hours. A haunch (that is a leg with, part of the loin)
cannot be well roasted in less than four hours.

Always have some currant jelly on the table to eat with roast mutton.
It should also be accompanied by mashed turnips.

Slices cut from a cold leg of mutton that has been under-done, are very
nice broiled or warmed on a gridiron, and sent to the breakfast table

Pickles are always eaten with mutton.

In preparing a leg of mutton for roasting, you may make deep incisions

The best cutlets are those taken from the leg or fillet. Cut them about
half an inch thick, and as large as the palm of your hand. Season them
with pepper and salt. Grate some stale bread, and rub it through a
cullender, adding to it chopped sweet marjoram, grated lemon-peel, and
some powdered mace or nutmeg. Spread the mixture on a large flat dish.
Have ready in a pan some beaten egg. First dip each cutlet into the
egg, and then into the seasoning on the dish, seeing that a sufficient
quantity adheres to both sides of the meat. Melt in your frying-pan,
over a quick fire, some beef-dripping, lard, or fresh butter, and when
it boils lay your cutlets in it, and fry them thoroughly; turning them
on both sides, and taking care that they do not burn. Place them in a
covered dish near the fire, while you finish the gravy in the pan, by
first skimming it, and then shaking in a little flour and stirring it
round. Pour the gravy hot round the cutlets, and garnish with little
bunches of curled parsley.

You may mix with the bread crumbs a little saffron.",recipe
