        "Last week we worked in Python, today we will work in R. This isn't for any deep, philosophical reasons. Instead, I learned to do this work in R and it's where I still feel most comfortable coding. Like last week, you don't have to know how to write any of this code to work through the lab, but there are places where you can adjust and adapt if you are comfortable doing so. Following [our reading from Ben Schmidt](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/557c453b-4abb-48ce-8c38-a77e24d3f0bd#ch48) today, we will focus on understanding the _transformations_ of our data at each stage of this process rather than trying to understand the nitty-gritty of each algorithm in use. \n",

COLEs, his Secre­\ntary, the following M18 .SS A;1G~ to\nboth H-ouse.s of Congress.\nTo rIE SENA_' AND LOUSE OF RE­\nPREiSENt'ArIlES of the UNIffID\nS7 rn\"'c s.\nCircumnstances, fellow-citizens,\nwhich seriously threatened the peace t\nof our country have made it a duty to\nconvene you at an earlier period than\nusual. The love of peace so much\ncherished in the bosom of our citizens,\nwiuich has so long guided the pro­\ncceedings of their public councils, and\ninduced forbearance under so many I\nwrongs, may` not ensure our contillnu­\nance in the quiet pursuits of industry. 1\nThe mn:y-v injujiues and depredatiotnls\ncomni 0tted\non our commerce andi lsa­\nvi;ation upon the high seas for years i\nlpast, the successive innovations on\nthose principles of public law which\nhave been established by the reason\nand usage of nations as the rule of I\ntheir intercourse, and the umpire\nand security of their rights and peace, t\nand al!l the ciircm1n;tances which in­ t\nduced the extraordinary mission to i\nLondon, are already known to you.\nThe instructions given to outr minis­\nteo's were framed in the sincerest spi­ i\nrit of amity and moderation. They\naccordingly proceeded, in conformity\nwherewith, to propose arrangements\nwhich might embrace and settle all 1\nthe points in diflference between .us;\nwhich might bring us to a mutual un­\nderstanding on our neutral and nation­\nal rights, and provide for a commer­\ncial intercourse on conditions of some 1\nequality. After long and fruitless en­\ndeavors to effect the purposes of their 1\nmission, and to obtain arrangements\nwithin the limits of their instructions,\nthey concluded to sign such as couldl\nbe obtained, and to send them for con­\nside ration : candidly declaring to the\nother negociators, at the same time,\nthat they were acting against their in­\ni\nstructions, and that their government I\ntherefore could not be pledged for\nratification. Some of the articles pro­\nposed might have been admitted on a\nprinciple of compromise, but others\nwere too highly disadvantageous ; and\nnlo sufficient provision was made a­\ngainst tie principal source of the irri­\ntations and collisions which were con­\nstanitly endangering the peace of the\ntwo nations. The question therefore\nwhether a treaty snould be accepted in\nt!h~t form could have admitted but of\none decision, even had no declarations\nof the other party impaired our coinfi­\ndence in it. Still anxious not to close\nthe door against friendly adjustment,\nnew modifications were framed, and\nfurther concessions authorised than\ncould before have been supposed ne­\ncessary : and our ministers were in­\nstructed to resume their negociations\non these grounds. On this new re­\nference to amicable discussion we\nj were reposing in confidence, when\non the twenty-second day of June\nlast, by a formal order from a Bri­\n{ tish admiral, the frigate Chesapeake,\nleaving her port for a distant service,\n\"was attacked by one of those vessels\nSwhich had been lying in our har­\nbors under the indulgences of hospi­\ntality, was disabled from proceeding,\nhad several of her crew killed, and\nfour taken away. On this outrage no\ncommentaries are necessary. Its cha­\nracter has been pronouncedC by the\nindignant voice of our citizens wiith an\nemphasis and unanimity never ex­\nceeded. I immediately by proclama­\ntion, interdicted our harbours and wa­\nters to all British armed vessels, for­\nbade intercourse with them, and, un­\ncertain how far hostilities were in­\nI tended, and the town of Norfolk in­\ne deed being threatened w-ith immediate\nSattack,\na sufficient force was ordered\ne\nfor the protection of that place, and\nT such other preparations commenced\nand pursued as the prospect rendered\n, proper. An armed vessel of the\nt United States was dispatched with in­\nstructions to our ministers at London,\ne to call on that governmenti for the sa­\ntisfaction and security rc:quired by the\noutrage. A very short interval cught\nnow to bring the answer which shall\nbe communicated to you as soon as\n- recei;ed: then also, or as soon after\nr as.the pubiic interests shall be Ibund\nto admit, the unratified treaty and pro­\nceedings relative to it shali be made\ny known to you.\nT1 he aggres~sion, thus begun, has\nr been continued on the part of the 13Bi­\nttish commanlders, by remaining with!in\nour waters in defiance of the authorl -\nfe ty of the country, by habitual viola­\ni' tions of its jurisdiction, and at length\nby putting to death one of the per;ons\nwhonm they had forcibly taken from on\nboard the Chesapcake. These ag;ra­\nvations necessarily lead to the policy\neither of :ever admitting an armncrl vessel into our harbors or of maintain­\ning in every harbor such an armed\nforce'\nas may constrain obedience to\nthe Jaws, anid protect tie lives and pro­\n.ri'ty of our citizens against their arm­\ned guests. But the expense of such a\nstanding force, and its inconsistence\nwith our principles, dispense\nwhh\nthose courtesies which would necessa­\nrily call for it, and leave us equally\nfree to exclude the liavy, as we are the\narmy of a foreign power, from en­\ntering our limits.\nTo fornmer violations of maritime\nrights, another is nsw added of very\nextensive effect. The government\nt\nof that nation has issued an order in-1\nterdicting, all trade hb neutrals bc­\ntweenl p\"i's not in a::itv with them.\nAnd bein:, now :t war with inearly\nevery natio;\" on the\n. .'' ;utic and Ile­\nditerrancall seas, ur: vessels are re­\nquired to sac'riice thcir rc: ges\nat\n\".\nfirst port they touch, or to ~'eturn\n;\nhome without the beneI\nt of f:i to\nany other market. U der tids n\ne\nlaws of the ocean, cur. t;rade\nc t :­\nditerranean has been swept away i­\n;\ns ei:zres and conde,:omation', :.i'; that\nin other' sc.:s is threatened with the\nsame fate.\nOur difierences with Spain r:'e1i\nstill unsettled ; no measure Las in,\nlIcen taken on her part, since my a1st\ncommunications to Congress, to brin ig\nthemll to a close. iut under a state\no.\nthings which mIa1: favor reconsidera­ i\nlion, they have been recently presse d,\nand an expectation is entertained that\nthey' may now soon ibe brought to an\nissue of some sort. With their sub­\njects on our borders, no new collisions\nhave taken place : nor seem immedti­\nately to be apprehended. To eu\"l for­\nmer grounds of complaiint 1has been\nadded a veryi serious one, as you\nwill see by the decree, a copy\nof which is now cormmunicatecd.\nWThether this decree which prI'escsses\nto be conformable to that of the French\ngovernment of Nov. 21, 11:3, here­\ntofore communicated to Congress,\nwill also be conformed to that in its\nconstruction and application in relati\non to the United States, had not been\nascertained at the date of our last\ncommunications. These however\ngave reason to expect such a confor­\nmity.\nWith the other nations of Europe\nour harmony has been uninterrupted,\nand comnmerce and fricndly inter­\ncourse have been maintained on their\nusual footing.\nOur peace with the several states\non the coast of Barbary appears ias\nfirm as at any former period, and as\nlikely to continue as that of any other\nnation.\nAmong our Indian neighbors in the\nnorth western quarter, sole fernie!n­\ntationl was olbserved soon alter the late\noccurrences thl;eatening the ccntillu­\nance of our peace. Messages ;were\nsaid to be interchanged, and tokens to\nbe passing which usually denote a\nstate of restlessness among them,\nand the character of the agitators\npointed to the sources of excitement.\nMeasues were immediately taken ior\nprosidhing against that danger: in­\nI\nstructions were \"Iiven to reruire ex­\nplanations, and, with assuranccs of\nCIt continued f'iendshipn , to admoiii:h\nthe tribes to remain quiet at home,\ntaking no part in cluarl:re!snot eiolg­\nI\ning to themni. As ar as we are yet li\nformed, the tribes in our vicinity, who\nare most advanced in the put suits 01\nindustry, are sincerely disposed to\nadhere to their friendship with uts, and\nto their peace with all others. WVhile\nthose more remote do not present\nappearances sufficiently quiet to jus­\ntify the intermission of mi!itary pre­\ncaution on our part.\nThe great tribes on our south wes­\ntern quarter, much advancedbeyond\nthe others in agriculture and houschc'd\narts, appear tranquil and identilyiag\ntheir views with ours, in proporio'n\nto their advancements. With the\nwhole of these people, in evcry quai:­\nter, I shall continue to inculcate peace\nand friendship with all their neighbors,\nand perseverance in those occupations\nand pursuits which will best pro:.ii:e\ntheir own well-being.\nThe appropriations of the last ses­\nsion, for the defence of our sea-port\ntowns and harbours, were made un­\nder expectation that a continut:ce o[\nour peace would permit us to procee:l\nin that work according to our conveni­\nence. It has been thought better to\napply the sums then given towards the\ndefence of New York, Charleston,\nand New Orleans chiefly, as most\nopen and most likely first to need pro­\ntection ; and to leave places less im­\nmediately in danger to the provisions\nof the present session.\nThe gun-boats too already provided\nhave, on alike principle, been chifvly\nassigned to New York, New Orleans ¶\nand the Chesapeake. \\Vhecthe: o::r\nmoveable force on the water, so arn­\nterial in aid of the defensive works on\nthe land, should he augmented in this\nor any other form, is left to the wis­\ndorm of the legislature. For the pur­\npose of manning thcse vessels, in\nsudden attacks on cur harbours, it is a .auer for consideration whether the\nseamen of the United States may not\njustly be formed into a special mili­\ntia, ti) be called on for tours of duty\nin defence of the harbours where they\nshall happen to be ; the ordinary mili­\ntia of the place furnishing that portion\nwhich may consist of landsmnen.\nThe moment our peace was threat­\n(nled, I deemed it indispensable to se­\nc(:'.re a greater provision of those arti­\n('Is of military stores with which cur\nn1 .g:.inles were not suifiicirintly fur­\nrsise:cd.

There are more than\nfiour-fifths of the Peers in this situation, and there are many\nof them who, might thus be deprived of the far better part\nof their incomes.\nIf, Qontrary to all expectation, there snould be found, in\nsome Peers, likely to amount to a majority, a disposition to\nreject the Bill, some of these Peers may be orlered away to\ntheir shlips, regiments, governments, and other duties; and,\n*rhich is an eqttAly alarming powver, new Peers may be\ncreated for the purpose, atid give their vote in thc decision.\nThat your Majesty's Ministers would advise these measures,\nif found necessary to render their prosecution successful,\nthere can be very little doubt; seeing that they have hitherto\nstooped at nothing, however unjust or odious.\nTo regard such a body as a Court of Justice would be to\ncalumniate that sacred name; and for me to suppress an\nexpression of my opinion on the subject would be tacitly to\n14iad.myself to my own destruction, as well as to an impo­\nsition upon the nation and the world.\nIn the House of Commons I can discover no better\ngrounds ofsecurity. Thepower of your Majesty's Ministers\nis the same in both Houses; and your Majesty is well ac­\nquainited with the fact,that a majority of this House is com­\nposed of persons plaeed in it by the Peers and by your Maa­\njesty's Treasury\nIt renly gives me pain to state these things to your Ma­ jest3, ..,n *f It -iesyour Alajesty pam, I beg that itS\nmay be observed, and retnembered, that the statement lhas\nbeen forced from me. I m-Dt -t:bvr protest against this1&gt;\ninotle.of tzial, or, by tacitly consenting to it, suffer my ho­\nnour to be sacrificed. Ng innocence can secure the accued­\nif the Judges and Jurorsbe chosen by the accuser, and if\nI were tacitly to submit to a tribunal of this description, I\nshould be instrumental in my own dishonour.\nOn these grounds I protest a,ainst this species of trial.\nI demand a trial in a Court where the Jurors are taken\nimpartially from amongst the people, and where the\nproceedings are open and fair. Such a trial I court, and E\nto no other will I willingly submit. If your Majestv\npersevere in the presenit proceeding, I shall, even in th;e\nHouses of Parliament, face my accusers; but I shall regardl\nany decision they may make against me as not in the smal-l\nest degree reflecting on my honour; and I wLill not, except\ncompelled by actual force, submit to any sentence which\nshall not be pronounced by a Cozurt of Justice.\nI have now franlkly laid before your Majesty a statement L\nof rny wrongs, and a declaration of tiry views and int'ntins\nYou have cast upon nie every slur to which the female\ncharacter is liable. Instead of lovinig, honouring, and N\ncherishing me, agreeably to your solemn vow, you havef\npursued me with hatred and scorn, and with al tue means\nof destruction. You wrested from me my child, an ith ;\nher my only comfort and consolation. Yo1I sent me sorrow.,\ning through the world, and even in my sorrows pursued mel\nwith unrelenting persecution. Having left me nothing but\nmy innocence, you would now, by a mockery of justice,\ndeprive me even of the reputation of possessing that. The\npoisoned bowl and the poniard are means more manly thr n\nperjured witnesses and partial tribunals ; and they -ire bs\ncruel, inasmuch as life is less valuable than honor If -my\nlife would have satisfied your Mfajesty, you should have bad\nit on the sole condition of giving me a place in the san\ntomb with my child : but, since yoiu woulId send me dis4\nhonoured to the grave, I will resist the attempt with all the\nmeans that it shall please God to give me.\n(Signed) CAROLINE, R.\nBrandenburgh-house, Aug. 7, 1820.\n- T'he above letter from her Majesty, which is dated\nAugust 7th, was sent by the Queen' messenger early in\nthe morning of the 8th to the Cottage at UWindsor, accoml\npanied with a note to Sir Benijamin Bloomfield, written bv &gt;\nthe Queen. desiring Sir Benjamin to deliver itinimediately -\nto the King.

The love of peace so much\ncherished in the bosom of our citizens,\nwiuich has so long guided the pro­\ncceedings of their public councils, and\ninduced forbearance under so many I\nwrongs, may` not ensure our contillnu­\nance in the quiet pursuits of industry. 1\nThe mn:y-v injujiues and depredatiotnls\ncomni 0tted\non our commerce andi lsa­\nvi;ation upon the high seas for years i\nlpast, the successive innovations on\nthose principles of public law which\nhave been established by the reason\nand usage of nations as the rule of I\ntheir intercourse, and the umpire\nand security of their rights and peace, t\nand al!l the ciircm1n;tances which in­ t\nduced the extraordinary mission to i\nLondon, are already known to you.\nThe instructions given to outr minis­\nteo's were framed in the sincerest spi­ i\nrit of amity and moderation. They\naccordingly proceeded, in conformity\nwherewith, to propose arrangements\nwhich might embrace and settle all 1\nthe points in diflference between .us;\nwhich might bring us to a mutual un­\nderstanding on our neutral and nation­\nal rights, and provide for a commer­\ncial intercourse on conditions of some 1\nequality. After long and fruitless en­\ndeavors to effect the purposes of their 1\nmission, and to obtain arrangements\nwithin the limits of their instructions,\nthey concluded to sign such as couldl\nbe obtained, and to send them for con­\nside ration : candidly declaring to the\nother negociators, at the same time,\nthat they were acting against their in­\ni\nstructions, and that their government I\ntherefore could not be pledged for\nratification. Some of the articles pro­\nposed might have been admitted on a\nprinciple of compromise, but others\nwere too highly disadvantageous ; and\nnlo sufficient provision was made a­\ngainst tie principal source of the irri­\ntations and collisions which were con­\nstanitly endangering the peace of the\ntwo nations. The question therefore\nwhether a treaty snould be accepted in\nt!h\\textasciitilde{}t form could have admitted but of\none decision, even had no declarations\nof the other party impaired our coinfi­\ndence in it. Still anxious not to close\nthe door against friendly adjustment,\nnew modifications were framed, and\nfurther concessions authorised than\ncould before have been supposed ne­\ncessary : and our ministers were in­\nstructed to resume their negociations\non these grounds. On this new re­\nference to amicable discussion we\nj were reposing in confidence, when\non the twenty-second day of June\nlast, by a formal order from a Bri­\n\\{ tish admiral, the frigate Chesapeake,\nleaving her port for a distant service,\n\"was attacked by one of those vessels\nSwhich had been lying in our har­\nbors under the indulgences of hospi­\ntality, was disabled from proceeding,\nhad several of her crew killed, and\nfour taken away. On this outrage no\ncommentaries are necessary. Its cha­\nracter has been pronouncedC by the\nindignant voice of our citizens wiith an\nemphasis and unanimity never ex­\nceeded. I immediately by proclama­\ntion, interdicted our harbours and wa­\nters to all British armed vessels, for­\nbade intercourse with them, and, un­\ncertain how far hostilities were in­\nI tended, and the town of Norfolk in­\ne deed being threatened w-ith immediate\nSattack,\na sufficient force was ordered\ne\nfor the protection of that place, and\nT such other preparations commenced\nand pursued as the prospect rendered\n, proper. An armed vessel of the\nt United States was dispatched with in­\nstructions to our ministers at London,\ne to call on that governmenti for the sa­\ntisfaction and security rc:quired by the\noutrage. A very short interval cught\nnow to bring the answer which shall\nbe communicated to you as soon as\n- recei;ed: then also, or as soon after\nr as.the pubiic interests shall be Ibund\nto admit, the unratified treaty and pro­\nceedings relative to it shali be made\ny known to you.\nT1 he aggres\\textasciitilde{}sion, thus begun, has\nr been continued on the part of the 13Bi­\nttish commanlders, by remaining with!in\nour waters in defiance of the authorl -\nfe ty of the country, by habitual viola­\ni' tions of its jurisdiction, and at length\nby putting to death one of the per;ons\nwhonm they had forcibly taken from on\nboard the Chesapcake. These ag;ra­\nvations necessarily lead to the policy\neither of :ever admitting an armncrl vessel into our harbors or of maintain­\ning in every harbor such an armed\nforce'\nas may constrain obedience to\nthe Jaws, anid protect tie lives and pro­\n.ri'ty of our citizens against their arm­\ned guests. But the expense of such a\nstanding force, and its inconsistence\nwith our principles, dispense\nwhh\nthose courtesies which would necessa­\nrily call for it, and leave us equally\nfree to exclude the liavy, as we are the\narmy of a foreign power, from en­\ntering our limits.\nTo fornmer violations of maritime\nrights, another is nsw added of very\nextensive effect. The government\nt\nof that nation has issued an order in-1\nterdicting, all trade hb neutrals bc­\ntweenl p\"i's not in a::itv with them.\nAnd bein:, now :t war with inearly\nevery natio;\" on the\n. .'' ;utic and Ile­\nditerrancall seas, ur: vessels are re­\nquired to sac'riice thcir rc: ges\nat\n\".\nfirst port they touch, or to \\textasciitilde{}'eturn\n;\nhome without the beneI\nt of f:i to\nany other market.

With their sub­\njects on our borders, no new collisions\nhave taken place : nor seem immedti­\nately to be apprehended. To eu\"l for­\nmer grounds of complaiint 1has been\nadded a veryi serious one, as you\nwill see by the decree, a copy\nof which is now cormmunicatecd.\nWThether this decree which prI'escsses\nto be conformable to that of the French\ngovernment of Nov. 21, 11:3, here­\ntofore communicated to Congress,\nwill also be conformed to that in its\nconstruction and application in relati\non to the United States, had not been\nascertained at the date of our last\ncommunications. These however\ngave reason to expect such a confor­\nmity.\nWith the other nations of Europe\nour harmony has been uninterrupted,\nand comnmerce and fricndly inter­\ncourse have been maintained on their\nusual footing.\nOur peace with the several states\non the coast of Barbary appears ias\nfirm as at any former period, and as\nlikely to continue as that of any other\nnation.\nAmong our Indian neighbors in the\nnorth western quarter, sole fernie!n­\ntationl was olbserved soon alter the late\noccurrences thl;eatening the ccntillu­\nance of our peace. Messages ;were\nsaid to be interchanged, and tokens to\nbe passing which usually denote a\nstate of restlessness among them,\nand the character of the agitators\npointed to the sources of excitement.\nMeasues were immediately taken ior\nprosidhing against that danger: in­\nI\nstructions were \"Iiven to reruire ex­\nplanations, and, with assuranccs of\nCIt continued f'iendshipn , to admoiii:h\nthe tribes to remain quiet at home,\ntaking no part in cluarl:re!snot eiolg­\nI\ning to themni. As ar as we are yet li\nformed, the tribes in our vicinity, who\nare most advanced in the put suits 01\nindustry, are sincerely disposed to\nadhere to their friendship with uts, and\nto their peace with all others. WVhile\nthose more remote do not present\nappearances sufficiently quiet to jus­\ntify the intermission of mi!itary pre­\ncaution on our part.\nThe great tribes on our south wes­\ntern quarter, much advancedbeyond\nthe others in agriculture and houschc'd\narts, appear tranquil and identilyiag\ntheir views with ours, in proporio'n\nto their advancements. With the\nwhole of these people, in evcry quai:­\nter, I shall continue to inculcate peace\nand friendship with all their neighbors,\nand perseverance in those occupations\nand pursuits which will best pro:.ii:e\ntheir own well-being.\nThe appropriations of the last ses­\nsion, for the defence of our sea-port\ntowns and harbours, were made un­\nder expectation that a continut:ce o{[}\nour peace would permit us to procee:l\nin that work according to our conveni­\nence. It has been thought better to\napply the sums then given towards the\ndefence of New York, Charleston,\nand New Orleans chiefly, as most\nopen and most likely first to need pro­\ntection ; and to leave places less im­\nmediately in danger to the provisions\nof the present session.\nThe gun-boats too already provided\nhave, on alike principle, been chifvly\nassigned to New York, New Orleans ¶\nand the Chesapeake. \\textbackslash{}Vhecthe: o::r\nmoveable force on the water, so arn­\nterial in aid of the defensive works on\nthe land, should he augmented in this\nor any other form, is left to the wis­\ndorm of the legislature. For the pur­\npose of manning thcse vessels, in\nsudden attacks on cur harbours, it is a .auer for consideration whether the\nseamen of the United States may not\njustly be formed into a special mili­\ntia, ti) be called on for tours of duty\nin defence of the harbours where they\nshall happen to be ; the ordinary mili­\ntia of the place furnishing that portion\nwhich may consist of landsmnen.\nThe moment our peace was threat­\n(nled, I deemed it indispensable to se­\nc(:'.re a greater provision of those arti­\n('Is of military stores with which cur\nn1 .g:.inles were not suifiicirintly fur­\nrsise:cd.

There are more than\nfiour-fifths of the Peers in this situation, and there are many\nof them who, might thus be deprived of the far better part\nof their incomes.\nIf, Qontrary to all expectation, there snould be found, in\nsome Peers, likely to amount to a majority, a disposition to\nreject the Bill, some of these Peers may be orlered away to\ntheir shlips, regiments, governments, and other duties; and,\n*rhich is an eqttAly alarming powver, new Peers may be\ncreated for the purpose, atid give their vote in thc decision.\nThat your Majesty's Ministers would advise these measures,\nif found necessary to render their prosecution successful,\nthere can be very little doubt; seeing that they have hitherto\nstooped at nothing, however unjust or odious.\nTo regard such a body as a Court of Justice would be to\ncalumniate that sacred name; and for me to suppress an\nexpression of my opinion on the subject would be tacitly to\n14iad.myself to my own destruction, as well as to an impo­\nsition upon the nation and the world.\nIn the House of Commons I can discover no better\ngrounds ofsecurity. Thepower of your Majesty's Ministers\nis the same in both Houses; and your Majesty is well ac­\nquainited with the fact,that a majority of this House is com­\nposed of persons plaeed in it by the Peers and by your Maa­\njesty's Treasury\nIt renly gives me pain to state these things to your Ma­ jest3, ..,n *f It -iesyour Alajesty pam, I beg that itS\nmay be observed, and retnembered, that the statement lhas\nbeen forced from me. I m-Dt -t:bvr protest against this1>\ninotle.of tzial, or, by tacitly consenting to it, suffer my ho­\nnour to be sacrificed. Ng innocence can secure the accued­\nif the Judges and Jurorsbe chosen by the accuser, and if\nI were tacitly to submit to a tribunal of this description, I\nshould be instrumental in my own dishonour.\nOn these grounds I protest a,ainst this species of trial.\nI demand a trial in a Court where the Jurors are taken\nimpartially from amongst the people, and where the\nproceedings are open and fair. Such a trial I court, and E\nto no other will I willingly submit. If your Majestv\npersevere in the presenit proceeding, I shall, even in th;e\nHouses of Parliament, face my accusers; but I shall regardl\nany decision they may make against me as not in the smal-l\nest degree reflecting on my honour; and I wLill not, except\ncompelled by actual force, submit to any sentence which\nshall not be pronounced by a Cozurt of Justice.\nI have now franlkly laid before your Majesty a statement L\nof rny wrongs, and a declaration of tiry views and int'ntins\nYou have cast upon nie every slur to which the female\ncharacter is liable. Instead of lovinig, honouring, and N\ncherishing me, agreeably to your solemn vow, you havef\npursued me with hatred and scorn, and with al tue means\nof destruction. You wrested from me my child, an ith ;\nher my only comfort and consolation. Yo1I sent me sorrow.,\ning through the world, and even in my sorrows pursued mel\nwith unrelenting persecution. Having left me nothing but\nmy innocence, you would now, by a mockery of justice,\ndeprive me even of the reputation of possessing that. The\npoisoned bowl and the poniard are means more manly thr n\nperjured witnesses and partial tribunals ; and they -ire bs\ncruel, inasmuch as life is less valuable than honor If -my\nlife would have satisfied your Mfajesty, you should have bad\nit on the sole condition of giving me a place in the san\ntomb with my child : but, since yoiu woulId send me dis4\nhonoured to the grave, I will resist the attempt with all the\nmeans that it shall please God to give me.\n(Signed) CAROLINE, R.\nBrandenburgh-house, Aug. 7, 1820.\n- T'he above letter from her Majesty, which is dated\nAugust 7th, was sent by the Queen' messenger early in\nthe morning of the 8th to the Cottage at UWindsor, accoml\npanied with a note to Sir Benijamin Bloomfield, written bv >\nthe Queen. desiring Sir Benjamin to deliver itinimediately -\nto the King.

COLEs, his Secre­\\ntary, the following M18 .SS A;1G~ to\\nboth H-ouse.s of Congress.\\nTo rIE SENA_' AND LOUSE OF RE­\\nPREiSENt'ArIlES of the UNIffID\\nS7 rn\"'c s.\\nCircumnstances, fellow-citizens,\\nwhich seriously threatened the peace t\\nof our country have made it a duty to\\nconvene you at an earlier period than\\nusual. The love of peace so much\\ncherished in the bosom of our citizens,\\nwiuich has so long guided the pro­\\ncceedings of their public councils, and\\ninduced forbearance under so many I\\nwrongs, may` not ensure our contillnu­\\nance in the quiet pursuits of industry. 1\\nThe mn:y-v injujiues and depredatiotnls\\ncomni 0tted\\non our commerce andi lsa­\\nvi;ation upon the high seas for years i\\nlpast, the successive innovations on\\nthose principles of public law which\\nhave been established by the reason\\nand usage of nations as the rule of I\\ntheir intercourse, and the umpire\\nand security of their rights and peace, t\\nand al!l the ciircm1n;tances which in­ t\\nduced the extraordinary mission to i\\nLondon, are already known to you.\\nThe instructions given to outr minis­\\nteo's were framed in the sincerest spi­ i\\nrit of amity and moderation. They\\naccordingly proceeded, in conformity\\nwherewith, to propose arrangements\\nwhich might embrace and settle all 1\\nthe points in diflference between .us;\\nwhich might bring us to a mutual un­\\nderstanding on our neutral and nation­\\nal rights, and provide for a commer­\\ncial intercourse on conditions of some 1\\nequality. After long and fruitless en­\\ndeavors to effect the purposes of their 1\\nmission, and to obtain arrangements\\nwithin the limits of their instructions,\\nthey concluded to sign such as couldl\\nbe obtained, and to send them for con­\\nside ration : candidly declaring to the\\nother negociators, at the same time,\\nthat they were acting against their in­\\ni\\nstructions, and that their government I\\ntherefore could not be pledged for\\nratification. Some of the articles pro­\\nposed might have been admitted on a\\nprinciple of compromise, but others\\nwere too highly disadvantageous ; and\\nnlo sufficient provision was made a­\\ngainst tie principal source of the irri­\\ntations and collisions which were con­\\nstanitly endangering the peace of the\\ntwo nations. The question therefore\\nwhether a treaty snould be accepted in\\nt!h~t form could have admitted but of\\none decision, even had no declarations\\nof the other party impaired our coinfi­\\ndence in it. Still anxious not to close\\nthe door against friendly adjustment,\\nnew modifications were framed, and\\nfurther concessions authorised than\\ncould before have been supposed ne­\\ncessary : and our ministers were in­\\nstructed to resume their negociations\\non these grounds. On this new re­\\nference to amicable discussion we\\nj were reposing in confidence, when\\non the twenty-second day of June\\nlast, by a formal order from a Bri­\\n{ tish admiral, the frigate Chesapeake,\\nleaving her port for a distant service,\\n\"was attacked by one of those vessels\\nSwhich had been lying in our har­\\nbors under the indulgences of hospi­\\ntality, was disabled from proceeding,\\nhad several of her crew killed, and\\nfour taken away. On this outrage no\\ncommentaries are necessary. Its cha­\\nracter has been pronouncedC by the\\nindignant voice of our citizens wiith an\\nemphasis and unanimity never ex­\\nceeded. I immediately by proclama­\\ntion, interdicted our harbours and wa­\\nters to all British armed vessels, for­\\nbade intercourse with them, and, un­\\ncertain how far hostilities were in­\\nI tended, and the town of Norfolk in­\\ne deed being threatened w-ith immediate\\nSattack,\\na sufficient force was ordered\\ne\\nfor the protection of that place, and\\nT such other preparations commenced\\nand pursued as the prospect rendered\\n, proper. An armed vessel of the\\nt United States was dispatched with in­\\nstructions to our ministers at London,\\ne to call on that governmenti for the sa­\\ntisfaction and security rc:quired by the\\noutrage. A very short interval cught\\nnow to bring the answer which shall\\nbe communicated to you as soon as\\n- recei;ed: then also, or as soon after\\nr as.the pubiic interests shall be Ibund\\nto admit, the unratified treaty and pro­\\nceedings relative to it shali be made\\ny known to you.\\nT1 he aggres~sion, thus begun, has\\nr been continued on the part of the 13Bi­\\nttish commanlders, by remaining with!in\\nour waters in defiance of the authorl -\\nfe ty of the country, by habitual viola­\\ni' tions of its jurisdiction, and at length\\nby putting to death one of the per;ons\\nwhonm they had forcibly taken from on\\nboard the Chesapcake. These ag;ra­\\nvations necessarily lead to the policy\\neither of :ever admitting an armncrl vessel into our harbors or of maintain­\\ning in every harbor such an armed\\nforce'\\nas may constrain obedience to\\nthe Jaws, anid protect tie lives and pro­\\n.ri'ty of our citizens against their arm­\\ned guests. But the expense of such a\\nstanding force, and its inconsistence\\nwith our principles, dispense\\nwhh\\nthose courtesies which would necessa­\\nrily call for it, and leave us equally\\nfree to exclude the liavy, as we are the\\narmy of a foreign power, from en­\\ntering our limits.\\nTo fornmer violations of maritime\\nrights, another is nsw added of very\\nextensive effect. The government\\nt\\nof that nation has issued an order in-1\\nterdicting, all trade hb neutrals bc­\\ntweenl p\"i's not in a::itv with them.\\nAnd bein:, now :t war with inearly\\nevery natio;\" on the\\n. .'' ;utic and Ile­\\nditerrancall seas, ur: vessels are re­\\nquired to sac'riice thcir rc: ges\\nat\\n\".\\nfirst port they touch, or to ~'eturn\\n;\\nhome without the beneI\\nt of f:i to\\nany other market.

With their sub­\\njects on our borders, no new collisions\\nhave taken place : nor seem immedti­\\nately to be apprehended. To eu\"l for­\\nmer grounds of complaiint 1has been\\nadded a veryi serious one, as you\\nwill see by the decree, a copy\\nof which is now cormmunicatecd.\\nWThether this decree which prI'escsses\\nto be conformable to that of the French\\ngovernment of Nov. 21, 11:3, here­\\ntofore communicated to Congress,\\nwill also be conformed to that in its\\nconstruction and application in relati\\non to the United States, had not been\\nascertained at the date of our last\\ncommunications. These however\\ngave reason to expect such a confor­\\nmity.\\nWith the other nations of Europe\\nour harmony has been uninterrupted,\\nand comnmerce and fricndly inter­\\ncourse have been maintained on their\\nusual footing.\\nOur peace with the several states\\non the coast of Barbary appears ias\\nfirm as at any former period, and as\\nlikely to continue as that of any other\\nnation.\\nAmong our Indian neighbors in the\\nnorth western quarter, sole fernie!n­\\ntationl was olbserved soon alter the late\\noccurrences thl;eatening the ccntillu­\\nance of our peace. Messages ;were\\nsaid to be interchanged, and tokens to\\nbe passing which usually denote a\\nstate of restlessness among them,\\nand the character of the agitators\\npointed to the sources of excitement.\\nMeasues were immediately taken ior\\nprosidhing against that danger: in­\\nI\\nstructions were \"Iiven to reruire ex­\\nplanations, and, with assuranccs of\\nCIt continued f'iendshipn , to admoiii:h\\nthe tribes to remain quiet at home,\\ntaking no part in cluarl:re!snot eiolg­\\nI\\ning to themni. As ar as we are yet li\\nformed, the tribes in our vicinity, who\\nare most advanced in the put suits 01\\nindustry, are sincerely disposed to\\nadhere to their friendship with uts, and\\nto their peace with all others. WVhile\\nthose more remote do not present\\nappearances sufficiently quiet to jus­\\ntify the intermission of mi!itary pre­\\ncaution on our part.\\nThe great tribes on our south wes­\\ntern quarter, much advancedbeyond\\nthe others in agriculture and houschc'd\\narts, appear tranquil and identilyiag\\ntheir views with ours, in proporio'n\\nto their advancements. With the\\nwhole of these people, in evcry quai:­\\nter, I shall continue to inculcate peace\\nand friendship with all their neighbors,\\nand perseverance in those occupations\\nand pursuits which will best pro:.ii:e\\ntheir own well-being.\\nThe appropriations of the last ses­\\nsion, for the defence of our sea-port\\ntowns and harbours, were made un­\\nder expectation that a continut:ce o[\\nour peace would permit us to procee:l\\nin that work according to our conveni­\\nence. It has been thought better to\\napply the sums then given towards the\\ndefence of New York, Charleston,\\nand New Orleans chiefly, as most\\nopen and most likely first to need pro­\\ntection ; and to leave places less im­\\nmediately in danger to the provisions\\nof the present session.\\nThe gun-boats too already provided\\nhave, on alike principle, been chifvly\\nassigned to New York, New Orleans ¶\\nand the Chesapeake. \\\\Vhecthe: o::r\\nmoveable force on the water, so arn­\\nterial in aid of the defensive works on\\nthe land, should he augmented in this\\nor any other form, is left to the wis­\\ndorm of the legislature. For the pur­\\npose of manning thcse vessels, in\\nsudden attacks on cur harbours, it is a .auer for consideration whether the\\nseamen of the United States may not\\njustly be formed into a special mili­\\ntia, ti) be called on for tours of duty\\nin defence of the harbours where they\\nshall happen to be ; the ordinary mili­\\ntia of the place furnishing that portion\\nwhich may consist of landsmnen.\\nThe moment our peace was threat­\\n(nled, I deemed it indispensable to se­\\nc(:'.re a greater provision of those arti­\\n('Is of military stores with which cur\\nn1 .g:.inles were not suifiicirintly fur­\\nrsise:cd.

              "5 ases. Your Mlajesty is flte plaintiffi: to you it\\nbelongs to appoint and to elevate Peers. Many of the pre­\\nsent Peers have been raised to that dignity by yourself, and\\nalnost the whole can be, at your will and pleasure,\\nfurther elevated. Trhe far greater part of the Peerrs\\nhold, by themselves and their families, offices, pensions,\\nand othier emoluments, solely at the will and plea­\\nsure of your Majesty, and these, of course, your Majesty\\ncan take away whenever you please. There are more than\\nfiour-fifths of the Peers in this situation, and there are many\\nof them who, might thus be deprived of the far better part\\nof their incomes.\\nIf, Qontrary to all expectation, there snould be found, in\\nsome Peers, likely to amount to a majority, a disposition to\\nreject the Bill, some of these Peers may be orlered away to\\ntheir shlips, regiments, governments, and other duties; and,\\n*rhich is an eqttAly alarming powver, new Peers may be\\ncreated for the purpose, atid give their vote in thc decision.\\nThat your Majesty's Ministers would advise these measures,\\nif found necessary to render their prosecution successful,\\nthere can be very little doubt; seeing that they have hitherto\\nstooped at nothing, however unjust or odious.\\nTo regard such a body as a Court of Justice would be to\\ncalumniate that sacred name; and for me to suppress an\\nexpression of my opinion on the subject would be tacitly to\\n14iad.myself to my own destruction, as well as to an impo­\\nsition upon the nation and the world.\\nIn the House of Commons I can discover no better\\ngrounds ofsecurity. Thepower of your Majesty's Ministers\\nis the same in both Houses; and your Majesty is well ac­\\nquainited with the fact,that a majority of this House is com­\\nposed of persons plaeed in it by the Peers and by your Maa­\\njesty's Treasury\\nIt renly gives me pain to state these things to your Ma­ jest3, ..,n *f It -iesyour Alajesty pam, I beg that itS\\nmay be observed, and retnembered, that the statement lhas\\nbeen forced from me. I m-Dt -t:bvr protest against this1>\\ninotle.of tzial, or, by tacitly consenting to it, suffer my ho­\\nnour to be sacrificed. Ng innocence can secure the accued­\\nif the Judges and Jurorsbe chosen by the accuser, and if\\nI were tacitly to submit to a tribunal of this description, I\\nshould be instrumental in my own dishonour.\\nOn these grounds I protest a,ainst this species of trial.\\nI demand a trial in a Court where the Jurors are taken\\nimpartially from amongst the people, and where the\\nproceedings are open and fair. Such a trial I court, and E\\nto no other will I willingly submit. If your Majestv\\npersevere in the presenit proceeding, I shall, even in th;e\\nHouses of Parliament, face my accusers; but I shall regardl\\nany decision they may make against me as not in the smal-l\\nest degree reflecting on my honour; and I wLill not, except\\ncompelled by actual force, submit to any sentence which\\nshall not be pronounced by a Cozurt of Justice.\\nI have now franlkly laid before your Majesty a statement L\\nof rny wrongs, and a declaration of tiry views and int'ntins\\nYou have cast upon nie every slur to which the female\\ncharacter is liable. Instead of lovinig, honouring, and N\\ncherishing me, agreeably to your solemn vow, you havef\\npursued me with hatred and scorn, and with al tue means\\nof destruction. You wrested from me my child, an ith ;\\nher my only comfort and consolation. Yo1I sent me sorrow.,\\ning through the world, and even in my sorrows pursued mel\\nwith unrelenting persecution. Having left me nothing but\\nmy innocence, you would now, by a mockery of justice,\\ndeprive me even of the reputation of possessing that. The\\npoisoned bowl and the poniard are means more manly thr n\\nperjured witnesses and partial tribunals ; and they -ire bs\\ncruel, inasmuch as life is less valuable than honor If -my\\nlife would have satisfied your Mfajesty, you should have bad\\nit on the sole condition of giving me a place in the san\\ntomb with my child : but, since yoiu woulId send me dis4\\nhonoured to the grave, I will resist the attempt with all the\\nmeans that it shall please God to give me.\\n(Signed) CAROLINE, R.\\nBrandenburgh-house, Aug. 7, 1820.\\n- T'he above letter from her Majesty, which is dated\\nAugust 7th, was sent by the Queen' messenger early in\\nthe morning of the 8th to the Cottage at UWindsor, accoml\\npanied with a note to Sir Benijamin Bloomfield, written bv >\\nthe Queen. desiring Sir Benjamin to deliver itinimediately -\\nto the King.

        "## Why Classify Genres?\n",
        "\n",
        "_Viral Texts_ RA Avery Blankenship wrote more about why she assembled this corpus of nineteenth-century receipes in this blog post, which also links to the text files if you want to read some of them: <https://viraltexts.org/2021/02/24/c19-recipes/>. What this post helps us understand is one use case for genre classification, which is when you have an enormous dataset and want to find one specific kind of material within it. Avery want to write about how culinary texts circulated in historical newspapers, but our data comprises millions of individual reprints. In order to find those she's interested in, we need a way to identify those reprints that are likely to be about culinary topics from the larger mass of texts. We could use keyword search to do that, but classification allows to cast a wider, exploratory net. As Avery shows, classification also enables her to find texts that are structured like recipes but aren't really about food, which gives insight into the broader uses to which the recipe genre was put during the period."

If force-meat balls are liked, make some force-meat as for\nWindsor pie, using if you prefer it chopped hard-boiled eggs in place of\nchopped meat, and binding into a paste with a raw egg; then make into\nballs, which drop into the crevices of the pie; boil two or three eggs\nquite hard, cut each in four and lay them round the sides and over the\ntop, pour in about a gill of gravy, and cover the same as the Windsor\npie.

Beat\nall together well, then add five more eggs, one at a time, that is to\nsay, add one egg and beat well, then another and beat again, and so on\nuntil the five are used.

If force-meat balls are liked, make some force-meat as for\nWindsor pie, using if you prefer it chopped hard-boiled eggs in place of\nchopped meat, and binding into a paste with a raw egg; then make into\nballs, which drop into the crevices of the pie; boil two or three eggs\nquite hard, cut each in four and lay them round the sides and over the\ntop, pour in about a gill of gravy, and cover the same as the Windsor\npie.

Or you may lay each olive on a thin\nslice of fat pork, roll it up, tie it, dip it in flour, and bake in a\nquick oven until beautifully brown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & recipe\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n",

If force-meat balls are liked, make some force-meat as for\\nWindsor pie, using if you prefer it chopped hard-boiled eggs in place of\\nchopped meat, and binding into a paste with a raw egg; then make into\\nballs, which drop into the crevices of the pie; boil two or three eggs\\nquite hard, cut each in four and lay them round the sides and over the\\ntop, pour in about a gill of gravy, and cover the same as the Windsor\\npie. In either of these pies the force-meat may be left out, a\\nsweetbread cut up, or mushrooms put in.\\n\\nA chicken pie to eat cold is very fine made in this way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
              "4 BABA.--One pound of flour; take one quarter of it, and make a sponge\\nwith half an ounce of compressed yeast and a little warm water, set it\\nto rise, make a hole in the rest of the flour, add to it ten ounces of\\nbutter, three eggs, and a dessert-spoonful of sugar, a little salt,\\nunless your butter salts it enough, which is generally the case. Beat\\nall together well, then add five more eggs, one at a time, that is to\\nsay, add one egg and beat well, then another and beat again, and so on\\nuntil the five are used. When the paste leaves the bowl it is beaten\\nenough, but not before; then add the sponge to it, and a large half\\nounce of citron chopped, the same of currants, and an ounce and a half\\nof sultana raisins, seedless. Let it rise to twice its size, then bake\\nit in an oven of dark yellow paper heat; the small round babas are an\\ninnovation of the pastry-cook to enable him to sell them uncut. But the\\nbaba proper should be baked in a large, deep, upright tin, such as a\\nlarge charlotte russe mold, when they keep for several days fresh, and\\nif they get stale, make delicious fritters, soaked in sherry and dipped\\nin frying batter.\\n\\nIn some cases, however, it may be preferred to make them as usually seen\\nat French pastry cooks; for this purpose you require a dozen small-sized\\n_round_ charlotte russe molds, which fill half full only, as they rise\\nvery much; bake these in a hotter oven, light brown paper heat; try with\\na twig as you would any other cake, if it comes out dry it is done; then\\nprepare a syrup as follows: Boil half pound of sugar in a pint of water,\\nadd to this the third of a pint of rum, and some apricot pulp--peach\\nwill of course do--and boil all together a few minutes; pour this half\\nan inch deep in a dish, and stand the cake or cakes in it; it should\\ndrink up all the syrup, you may also sprinkle some over it. If any syrup\\nremains, use it to warm over your cake when stale, instead of the\\nsherry.\n",

While this is cooking, cut some underdone oblong slices\\nof beef about half an inch thick, hack it with a sharp knife on _both\\nsides_; then mix the cooked force-meat with the yolk of an egg and a\\ntablespoonful of gravy; put a spoonful of this paste in the center of\\neach slice of meat and tie it up carefully in the shape of an egg. Then\\nif you have some nice gravy, thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in\\nflour, roll each olive slightly in flour and lay it in the gravy and let\\nit very gently _simmer_ for half an hour. A few chopped oysters added to\\nthe gravy will be a great addition. Or you may lay each olive on a thin\\nslice of fat pork, roll it up, tie it, dip it in flour, and bake in a\\nquick oven until beautifully brown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

When doing any kind of machine learning research, you typically keep a test data set aside for this kind of verification. Whatever kind of data you are researching—whether images, text, video, or something else—the test data has been tagged by whatever feature you are trying to model, but you treat it as if is not tagged to test how well your model's asssessments line up with human assessments. If we have trained a reliable genre classifier, for example, we would expect it to identify texts we know are recipes as recipes. If it doesn't, then we would now we have more work to do."

For today's class we'll follow Schmidt's argument and not try to unpack the algorithm fully, though you probably should if you continue to use models like this in your work. We still want an idea of the transformation that is happening to our data in this stage, however. We are using a [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) which, to oversimplify dramatically by quoting the first sentence of the Wikipedia article, \"models the probability of one event (out of two alternatives) taking place.\" Here the probabilities are pretty simple: our model will look at all the words in the texts labeled `recipe` to calculate the probability that each word belongs to the `receipe` category vs. the `unknown` category. From there, the model can be applied to documents full of words to calculate the probability that X text, comprising Y set of words, belongs to the category `recipe`. "

              "1   TO ROAST A PIG.\\n\\nBegin your preparations by making the stuffing. Take a sufficient\\nquantity of grated stale bread, and mix it with sage and sweet marjoram\\nrubbed fine or powdered; also some grated lemon-peel. Season it with\\npepper, salt, powdered nutmeg and mace; mix in butter enough to moisten\\nit, and some beaten yolk of egg to bind it. Let the whole be very well\\nincorporated.\\n\\nThe pig should be newly killed, (that morning if possible,) nicely\\ncleaned, fat, and not too large. Wash it well in cold water, and cut\\noff the feet close to the joints, leaving some skin all round to fold\\nover the ends. Take out the liver and heart, and reserve them, with the\\nfeet, to make the gravy. Truss back the legs. Fill the body with the\\nstuffing (it must be quite full) and then sew it up, or tie it round\\nwith a buttered twine. Put the pig on the spit, and place it before a\\nclear brisk fire, but not too near lest it scorch. The fire should be\\nlargest at the ends, that the middle of the pig may not be done before\\nthe extremities. If you find the heat too great in the centre, you may\\ndiminish it by placing a flat-iron before the fire. When you first put\\nit down, wash the pig all over with salt and water; afterwards rub it\\nfrequently with a feather dipped in sweet oil, or with fresh butter\\ntied in a rag. If you baste it with any thing else, or with its own\\ndripping, the skin will not be crisp. Take care not to blister or burn\\nthe outside by keeping it too near the fire. A good sized pig will\\nrequire at least three hours’ roasting.\\n\\nUnless a pig is very small it is seldom sent to table whole. Take the\\nspit from the fire, and place it across a large dish: then, having cut\\noff the head with a sharp knife, and cut down the back, slip the spit\\nout. Lay the two halves of the body close together in the dish, and\\nplace half the head on each side. Garnish with sliced lemon.\\n\\nFor the gravy,—take, that from the dripping-pan and skim it well.\\nHaving boiled the heart, liver, and feet, with some minced sage in a\\nvery little water, cut the meat from the feet, and chop it. Chop also\\nthe liver and heart. Put all into a small sauce-pan, adding a little of\\nthe water that they were boiled in, and some bits of butter rolled in\\nflour. Flavour it with a glass of Madeira, and some grated nutmeg. Give\\nit a boil up, and send it to table in a gravy-boat.\\n\\nYou may serve up with the pig, apple-sauce, cranberry sauce, or\\nbread-sauce in a small tureen; or currant jelly.\\n\\nIf you bake the pig instead of roasting it, rub it from time to time\\nwith fresh butter tied in a rag.\n",
              "2   CANTELOPES OR MUSK-MELONS.\\n\\nTake very small cantelopes before they are ripe. Shave a thin paring\\noff the whole outside. Cut out a small piece or plug about an inch\\nsquare, and through it extract all the seeds, &c. from the middle.\\nThen, return the plugs to the hole from whence you took them, and\\nsecure them with a needle and thread, or by tying a small string round\\nthe cantelope.\\n\\nLay the cantelopes for four or five hours in salt and water. Then put\\nthem into spring water to extract the salt, changing the water till you\\nfind it salt no longer. Scald them in weak alum-water. Make a syrup in\\nthe proportion of a pint of water to a pound of loaf-sugar, and boil\\nthe cantelopes in it till a straw will go through them. Then take them\\nout, and set them in the sun to harden.\\n\\nPrepare some fine ripe oranges, paring off the yellow rind very thin,\\nand cutting it into slips, and then laying it in scalding water to\\nextract the bitterness. Cut the oranges into pieces; allow a pint of\\nwater to each orange, and boil them to a pulp. Afterwards strain them,\\nand allow to each pint of the liquid, a pound of the best loaf-sugar,\\nand stir in a little beaten white of egg; one white to four pounds of\\nsugar. This is for the second syrup. Boil the peel in it, skimming it\\nwell. When the peel is soft, take it all out; for if left among the\\ncantelopes, it will communicate to it too strong a taste of the orange.\\n\\nPut the cantelopes into your jars, and pour over them the hot syrup.\\nCover them closely, and keep them in a dry cool place.\\n\\nLarge cantelopes may be prepared for preserving (after you have taken\\noff the outer rind) by cutting them into pieces according to the\\nnatural divisions with which they are fluted. This receipt for\\npreserving cantelopes whole, will do very well for green lemons or\\nlimes, substituting lemon-peel and lemon-juice for that of oranges in\\nthe second syrup.\\n\\nYou may use some of the first syrup to boil up the pulp of the orange\\nor lemons that has been left. It will make a sort of marmalade, that is\\nvery good for colds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

If they are not then of\\na fine green, repeat the process. When they are well greened, take them\\nout of the kettle, drain them on a sieve, and put them into a clean\\nstone jar. Boil for five or six minutes sufficient of the best vinegar\\nto cover the cucumbers well; putting into the kettle a thin muslin bag\\nfilled with cloves, mace, and mustard seed. Pour the vinegar scalding\\nhot into the jar of pickles, which should be secured with a large flat\\ncork, and an oil-cloth or leather cover tied over it. Another way to\\ngreen pickles is to cover them with vine leaves or cabbage leaves, and\\nto keep them on a warm, hearth pouring boiling water on them five or\\nsix times a day; renewing the water as soon as it becomes cold.\\n\\nIn proportioning the spice to the vinegar, allow to every two quarts,\\nan ounce of mace, two dozen cloves, and two ounces of mustard seed. You\\nmay leave the muslin bag, with the spice, for about a week in the\\npickle jar to heighten the flavour, if you think it necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

You\\nmay add some grated cold ham. Light some writing paper, and singe the\\nhairs from the skin of the turkey. Reserve the neck, liver, and gizzard\\nfor the gravy. Stuff the craw of the turkey with the force-meat, of\\nwhich there should be enough made to form into balls for frying, laying\\nthem round the turkey when it is dished. Dredge it with flour, and\\nroast it before a clear brisk fire, basting it with cold lard. Towards\\nthe last, set the turkey nearer to the fire, dredge it again very\\nlightly with flour, and baste it with butter. It will require,\\naccording to its size, from two to three hours roasting.\\n\\nMake the gravy of the giblets cut in pieces, seasoned, and stewed for\\ntwo hours in a very little water; thicken it with a spoonful of browned\\nflour, and stir into it the gravy from the dripping-pan, having first\\nskimmed off the fat.\\n\\nA turkey should be accompanied by ham or tongue. Serve up with it\\nmushroom-sauce. Have stewed cranberries on the table to eat with it. Do\\nnot help any one to the legs, or drum-sticks as they are called.\\n\\nTurkeys are sometimes stuffed entirely with sausage-meat. Small cakes\\nof this meat should then be fried, and laid round it.\\n\\nTo bone a turkey, you must begin with a very sharp knife at the top of\\nthe wings, and scrape the flesh loose from the bone without dividing or\\ncutting it to pieces. If done carefully and dexterously, the whole mass\\nof flesh may be separated from the bone, so that you can take hold of\\nthe head and draw out the entire skeleton at once. A large quantity of\\nforce-meat having been prepared, stuff it hard into the turkey,\\nrestoring it by doing so to its natural form, filling out the body,\\nbreast, wings and legs, so as to resemble their original shape when the\\nbones were in. Roast or bake it; pouring a glass of port wine into the\\ngravy. A boned turkey is frequently served up cold, covered with lumps\\nof currant jelly; slices of which are laid round the dish.\\n\\nAny sort of poultry or game may be boned and stuffed in the same\\nmanner,\\n\\nA cold turkey that has not been boned is sometimes sent to table larded\\nall over the breast with slips of fat bacon, drawn through the flesh\\nwith a larding needle, and arranged in regular form.                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
              "11  BROILED HAM.\\n\\nCut the ham into very thin slices, (the thinner the better.) Soak them\\nin hot water at least half an hour, (a whole hour is better,) to draw\\nout some of the salt; changing the water several times, and always\\npouring it on scalding hot. This process will not only extract the\\nsuperfluous salt (which would otherwise ooze out in broiling and remain\\nsticking about the surface of the meat) but it makes the ham more\\ntender and mellow. After soaking, dry the slices in a cloth, and then\\nheat your gridiron, and broil them over a clear fire.\\n\\nIf you have cold boiled ham, it is better for broiling than that which\\nis raw; and being boiled, will require no soaking before you put it on\\nthe gridiron.\\n\\nIf you wish to serve up eggs with the ham, put some lard into a very\\nclean frying-pan, and make it boiling hot. Break the eggs separately\\ninto a saucer, that in case a bad one should be among them it may not\\nmix with the rest. Slip each egg gently into the frying-pan. Do not\\nturn them while they are frying, but keep pouring some of the hot lard\\nover them with an iron spoon; this will do them sufficiently on the\\nupper side. They will be done enough in about three minutes; the white\\nmust retain its transparency so that the yolk will be seen through it.\\nWhen done, take them up with a tin slice, drain off the lard, and if\\nany part of the white is discoloured or ragged, trim it off. Lay a\\nfried egg upon each slice of the broiled ham, and send them to table\\nhot.\\n\\nThis is a much nicer way than the common practice of frying the ham or\\nbacon with the eggs. Some persons broil or fry the ham without eggs,\\nand send it to table cut into little slips or mouthfuls.\\n\\nTo curl small pieces of ham for garnishing, slice as thin as possible\\nsome that has been boiled or parboiled. The pieces should be about two\\ninches square. Roll it up round little wooden skewers, and put it into\\na cheese toaster, or into a tin oven, and set it before the fire for\\neight or ten minutes.

[Footnote:\\nYou may greatly improve the colour by pounding a handful of spinach in\\na mortar, straining the juice, and adding it to the soup about a\\nquarter of an hour before it has done boiling.]\\n\\nHave ready two quarts of green peas that have been boiled in another\\npot with a sprig of mint, and two or three lumps of loaf sugar, (which\\nwill greatly improve the taste.) After they have boiled in this pot\\ntwenty minutes, take out the mint, put the whole peas into the pot of\\nsoup, and boil all together about ten minutes. Then put it into a\\ntureen, and send it to table.\\n\\nNever use hard old green peas for this soup, or for any other purpose.\\nWhen they begin to turn yellow, it is time to leave them off for the\\nseason.\\n\\nLima bean soup may be made in the same manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

              "15  ALMOND CHEESE CAKE.\\n\\nThis though usually called a cheese cake, is in fact a pudding.\\n\\nCut a piece of rennet about two inches square, wash off the salt in\\ncold water, and wipe it dry. Put it into a tea-cup, pour on it\\nsufficient lukewarm water to cover it, and let it soak all night, or at\\nleast several hours. Take a quart of milk, which must be made warm, but\\nnot boiling. Stir the rennet-water into it. Cover it, and set it in a\\nwarm place. When the curd has become quite firm, and the whey looks\\ngreenish, drain off the whey, and set the curd in a cool place. While\\nthe milk is turning, prepare the other ingredients. Wash and dry half a\\npound of currants, and dredge them well with flour. Blanch three ounces\\nof sweet and one ounce of bitter almonds, by scalding and peeling them.\\nThen cool them in cold water, wiping them dry before you put them into\\nthe mortar. If you cannot procure bitter almonds, peach kernels may be\\nsubstituted. Beat them, one at a time, in the mortar to a smooth paste,\\npouring in with every one a few drops of rose water to prevent their\\nbeing oily, dull-coloured, and heavy. If you put a sufficiency of rose\\nwater, the pounded almond paste will be light, creamy, and perfectly\\nwhite. Mix, as you do them, the sweet and bitter almonds together. Then\\nbeat the yolks of eight eggs, and when light, mix them gradually with\\nthe curd. Add five table-spoonfuls of cream, and a tea-spoonful of\\nmixed spice. Lastly, stir in, by degrees, the pounded almonds, and the\\ncurrants alternately. Stir the whole mixture very hard. Bake it in\\nbuttered dishes, laying puff paste round the edges.

Take one\\njill or eight large fable-spoonfuls from a quart of rich milk, and stir\\ninto it, gradually, eight spoonfuls of sifted flour. Mix it to a smooth\\nbatter, pressing out all the lumps with the back of the spoon. Beat six\\neggs very light, and stir them, by degrees, into the remainder of the\\nmilk, alternately with the batter that you have just mixed.

It is best the second day, and will keep soft a\\nweek.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Melt a little unsweetened\\nchocolate by setting it in a saucer over the boiling kettle, then take\\nenough of it to make your third piece of _fondant_ a fine brown; now\\ndivide the white into two parts; make each an inch and a half wide, and\\nas long as it will; do the same with the chocolate _fondant_; then take\\nthe pink, make it the same width and length, but of course, not being\\ndivided, it will be twice as thick; now butter slightly the back of a\\nplate, or, better still, get a few sheets of waxed paper from the\\nconfectioner's; lay one strip of the chocolate on it, then a strip of\\nwhite on that, then the pink, the other white, and lastly the chocolate\\nagain; then lightly press them to make them adhere, but not to squeeze\\nthem out of shape.

              "77  TO BOTTLE GOOSEBERRIES.\\n\\nFor this purpose the gooseberries must be large and full grown, but\\nquite green. Top and tail them, and put them into wide-mouthed bottles\\nas far up as the beginning of the neck. Cover the bottom of a large\\nboiler or kettle with saw-dust or straw. Stand the bottles of\\ngooseberries (slightly corked) upright in the boiler, and pour round\\nthem cold water to each, as far up as the fruit. Put a brisk fire under\\nthe boiler, and when the water boils up, instantly take out the bottles\\nand fill them up to the mouth with boiling water, which you must have\\nready in a tea-kettle. Cork them again slightly, and when quite cold\\nput in the corks very tight and seal them. Lay the bottles on their\\nsides in a box of dry sand, and turn them every day for four or five\\nweeks. If properly managed, the gooseberries will keep a year, and may\\nbe used at any time, by stewing them with sugar.\\n\\nYou may bottle damsons in the same manner; also grapes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

They should accompany boiled beef or\\nmutton.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Then take out the jar and strain the essence of\\nthe beef into a bowl. Chicken tea may be made in the same manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
              "85  TO PICKLE BEEF OR TONGUES.\\n\\nThe beef must be fresh killed, and of the best kind. You must wipe\\nevery piece well, to dry it from the blood and moisture. To fifty\\npounds of meat allow two pounds and a quarter of coarse salt, two\\npounds and a quarter of fine salt, one ounce and a half of saltpetre,\\none pound and a half of brown sugar, and one quart of molasses. Mix all\\nthese ingredients well together, boil and skim it for about twenty\\nminutes, and when no more scum rises, take it from the fire. Have ready\\nthe beef in a large tub, or in a barrel; pour the brine gradually upon\\nit with a ladle, and as it cools rub it well into every part of the\\nmeat. A molasses hogshead sawed in two is a good receptacle for pickled\\nmeat. Cover it well with a thick cloth, and look at it frequently,\\nskimming off whatever may float on the top, and basting the meat with\\nthe brine. In about a fortnight the beef will be fit for use.\\n\\nTongues may be put into the same cask with the beef, one or two at a\\ntime, as you procure them from the butcher. None of them will be ready\\nfor smoking in less than six weeks; but they had best remain in pickle\\ntwo or three months. They should not be sent to the smoke-house later\\nthan March. If you do them at home, they will require three weeks’\\nsmoking over a wood fire. Hang them with the root or large end upwards.\\nWhen done, sew up each tongue tightly in coarse linen, and hang them up\\nin a dark dry cellar.\\n\\nPickled tongues without smoking are seldom liked.\\n\\nThe last of October is a good time for putting meat into pickle. If the\\nweather is too warm or too cold, it will not take the salt well.\\n\\nIn the course of the winter the pickle may probably require a second\\nboiling with additional ingredients.\\n\\nHalf an ounce of pearl-ash added to the other articles will make the\\nmeat more tender, but many persons thinks it injures the taste.\\n\\nThe meat must always be kept completely immersed in the brine. To\\neffect this a heavy board should be laid upon it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
              "86  Spiced Beef in the Irish Style.\\n\\nTo a round weighing from twenty to twenty-five pounds, take a pint of\\nsalt, one ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of pepper, two ounces of\\ncloves, one ounce of allspice, four ounces of brown sugar, all well\\npulverized, and mixed together; rub the round well with it, and lay it\\nin a small tub or vessel by itself. Turn and rub it once a day for ten\\ndays. It will not injure if it remain a week longer in the spices, if it\\nshould not be convenient to bake it.

Squirrels make very good soup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Take a sufficient\nquantity of grated stale bread, and mix it with sage and sweet marjoram\nrubbed fine or powdered; also some grated lemon-peel. Season it with\npepper, salt, powdered nutmeg and mace; mix in butter enough to moisten\nit, and some beaten yolk of egg to bind it. Let the whole be very well\nincorporated.\n\nThe pig should be newly killed, (that morning if possible,) nicely\ncleaned, fat, and not too large. Wash it well in cold water, and cut\noff the feet close to the joints, leaving some skin all round to fold\nover the ends. Take out the liver and heart, and reserve them, with the\nfeet, to make the gravy. Truss back the legs. Fill the body with the\nstuffing (it must be quite full) and then sew it up, or tie it round\nwith a buttered twine. Put the pig on the spit, and place it before a\nclear brisk fire, but not too near lest it scorch. The fire should be\nlargest at the ends, that the middle of the pig may not be done before\nthe extremities. If you find the heat too great in the centre, you may\ndiminish it by placing a flat-iron before the fire. When you first put\nit down, wash the pig all over with salt and water; afterwards rub it\nfrequently with a feather dipped in sweet oil, or with fresh butter\ntied in a rag. If you baste it with any thing else, or with its own\ndripping, the skin will not be crisp. Take care not to blister or burn\nthe outside by keeping it too near the fire. A good sized pig will\nrequire at least three hours’ roasting.\n\nUnless a pig is very small it is seldom sent to table whole. Take the\nspit from the fire, and place it across a large dish: then, having cut\noff the head with a sharp knife, and cut down the back, slip the spit\nout. Lay the two halves of the body close together in the dish, and\nplace half the head on each side. Garnish with sliced lemon.\n\nFor the gravy,—take, that from the dripping-pan and skim it well.\nHaving boiled the heart, liver, and feet, with some minced sage in a\nvery little water, cut the meat from the feet, and chop it. Chop also\nthe liver and heart. Put all into a small sauce-pan, adding a little of\nthe water that they were boiled in, and some bits of butter rolled in\nflour. Flavour it with a glass of Madeira, and some grated nutmeg. Give\nit a boil up, and send it to table in a gravy-boat.\n\nYou may serve up with the pig, apple-sauce, cranberry sauce, or\nbread-sauce in a small tureen; or currant jelly.\n\nIf you bake the pig instead of roasting it, rub it from time to time\nwith fresh butter tied in a rag. |\n| 9624_cantelopesormuskmelons.txt          | 22.38101 | 1.0000000 | CANTELOPES OR MUSK-MELONS.\n\nTake very small cantelopes before they are ripe. Shave a thin paring\noff the whole outside. Cut out a small piece or plug about an inch\nsquare, and through it extract all the seeds, &amp;c. from the middle.\nThen, return the plugs to the hole from whence you took them, and\nsecure them with a needle and thread, or by tying a small string round\nthe cantelope.\n\nLay the cantelopes for four or five hours in salt and water. Then put\nthem into spring water to extract the salt, changing the water till you\nfind it salt no longer. Scald them in weak alum-water. Make a syrup in\nthe proportion of a pint of water to a pound of loaf-sugar, and boil\nthe cantelopes in it till a straw will go through them. Then take them\nout, and set them in the sun to harden.\n\nPrepare some fine ripe oranges, paring off the yellow rind very thin,\nand cutting it into slips, and then laying it in scalding water to\nextract the bitterness. Cut the oranges into pieces; allow a pint of\nwater to each orange, and boil them to a pulp. Afterwards strain them,\nand allow to each pint of the liquid, a pound of the best loaf-sugar,\nand stir in a little beaten white of egg; one white to four pounds of\nsugar. This is for the second syrup. Boil the peel in it, skimming it\nwell. When the peel is soft, take it all out; for if left among the\ncantelopes, it will communicate to it too strong a taste of the orange.\n\nPut the cantelopes into your jars, and pour over them the hot syrup.\nCover them closely, and keep them in a dry cool place.\n\nLarge cantelopes may be prepared for preserving (after you have taken\noff the outer rind) by cutting them into pieces according to the\nnatural divisions with which they are fluted. This receipt for\npreserving cantelopes whole, will do very well for green lemons or\nlimes, substituting lemon-peel and lemon-juice for that of oranges in\nthe second syrup.\n\nYou may use some of the first syrup to boil up the pulp of the orange\nor lemons that has been left. It will make a sort of marmalade, that is\nvery good for colds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| 9624_pickledporkandpeasepudding.txt      | 20.02492 | 0.9999999 | PICKLED PORK AND PEASE PUDDING.\n\nSoak the pork all night in cold water, and wash and scrape it clean.\nPut it on early in the day, as it will take a long time to boil, and\nmust boil slowly. Skim it frequently. Boil in a separate pot greens or\ncabbage to eat with it; also parsnips and potatoes.\n\nPease pudding is a frequent accompaniment to pickled pork, and is very\ngenerally liked. To make a small pudding, you must have ready a quart\nof dried split pease, which have been soaked all night in cold water.\nTie them in a cloth, (leaving room for them to swell,) and boil them\nslowly till they are tender. Drain them, and rub them through a\ncullender or a sieve into a deep dish; season them with pepper and\nsalt, and mix with them an ounce of butter, and two beaten eggs. Beat\nall well together till thoroughly mixed. Dip a clean cloth in hot\nwater, sprinkle it with flour, and put the pudding into it.

After you have taken out the apples, add the\nlemon-juice, put in the lemon-peel, and boil it till quite transparent.\nWhen the whole is cold, put the apples with the syrup into glass\ndishes, and dispose the wreaths of lemon-peel fancifully about them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| 9624_topicklecucumbers.txt               | 16.19532 | 0.9999945 | TO PICKLE CUCUMBERS.\n\nCucumbers for pickling should be very small, and as free from spots as\npossible. Make a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg.\nPour it over your cucumbers, cover them with fresh cabbage leaves, and\nlet them stand for a week, or till they are quite yellow, stirring them\nat least twice a day. When they are perfectly yellow, pour off the\nwater. Take a porcelain kettle, and cover the bottom and sides with\nfresh vine leaves. Put in the cucumbers (with a small piece of alum)\nand cover them closely with vine leaves all over the top, and then with\na dish or cloth to keep in the steam. Fill up the kettle with clear\nwater, and hang it over the fire when dinner is done, but not where\nthere is a blaze. The fire under the kettle must be kept very moderate.\nThe water must not boil, or be too hot to bear your hand in. Keep them\nover the fire in a slow heat till next morning. If they are not then of\na fine green, repeat the process. When they are well greened, take them\nout of the kettle, drain them on a sieve, and put them into a clean\nstone jar. Boil for five or six minutes sufficient of the best vinegar\nto cover the cucumbers well; putting into the kettle a thin muslin bag\nfilled with cloves, mace, and mustard seed. Pour the vinegar scalding\nhot into the jar of pickles, which should be secured with a large flat\ncork, and an oil-cloth or leather cover tied over it. Another way to\ngreen pickles is to cover them with vine leaves or cabbage leaves, and\nto keep them on a warm, hearth pouring boiling water on them five or\nsix times a day; renewing the water as soon as it becomes cold.\n\nIn proportioning the spice to the vinegar, allow to every two quarts,\nan ounce of mace, two dozen cloves, and two ounces of mustard seed. You\nmay leave the muslin bag, with the spice, for about a week in the\npickle jar to heighten the flavour, if you think it necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| 9624_toroastaturkey.txt                  | 15.92240 | 0.9999927 | TO ROAST A TURKEY.\n\nMake a force-meat of grated bread-crumbs, minced suet, sweet marjoram,\ngrated lemon-peel, nutmeg, pepper, salt, and beaten yolk of egg. You\nmay add some grated cold ham. Light some writing paper, and singe the\nhairs from the skin of the turkey. Reserve the neck, liver, and gizzard\nfor the gravy. Stuff the craw of the turkey with the force-meat, of\nwhich there should be enough made to form into balls for frying, laying\nthem round the turkey when it is dished. Dredge it with flour, and\nroast it before a clear brisk fire, basting it with cold lard. Towards\nthe last, set the turkey nearer to the fire, dredge it again very\nlightly with flour, and baste it with butter. It will require,\naccording to its size, from two to three hours roasting.\n\nMake the gravy of the giblets cut in pieces, seasoned, and stewed for\ntwo hours in a very little water; thicken it with a spoonful of browned\nflour, and stir into it the gravy from the dripping-pan, having first\nskimmed off the fat.\n\nA turkey should be accompanied by ham or tongue. Serve up with it\nmushroom-sauce. Have stewed cranberries on the table to eat with it. Do\nnot help any one to the legs, or drum-sticks as they are called.\n\nTurkeys are sometimes stuffed entirely with sausage-meat. Small cakes\nof this meat should then be fried, and laid round it.\n\nTo bone a turkey, you must begin with a very sharp knife at the top of\nthe wings, and scrape the flesh loose from the bone without dividing or\ncutting it to pieces. If done carefully and dexterously, the whole mass\nof flesh may be separated from the bone, so that you can take hold of\nthe head and draw out the entire skeleton at once. A large quantity of\nforce-meat having been prepared, stuff it hard into the turkey,\nrestoring it by doing so to its natural form, filling out the body,\nbreast, wings and legs, so as to resemble their original shape when the\nbones were in. Roast or bake it; pouring a glass of port wine into the\ngravy. A boned turkey is frequently served up cold, covered with lumps\nof currant jelly; slices of which are laid round the dish.\n\nAny sort of poultry or game may be boned and stuffed in the same\nmanner,\n\nA cold turkey that has not been boned is sometimes sent to table larded\nall over the breast with slips of fat bacon, drawn through the flesh\nwith a larding needle, and arranged in regular form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| 9624_broiledham.txt                      | 15.42338 | 0.9999880 | BROILED HAM.\n\nCut the ham into very thin slices, (the thinner the better.) Soak them\nin hot water at least half an hour, (a whole hour is better,) to draw\nout some of the salt; changing the water several times, and always\npouring it on scalding hot. This process will not only extract the\nsuperfluous salt (which would otherwise ooze out in broiling and remain\nsticking about the surface of the meat) but it makes the ham more\ntender and mellow. After soaking, dry the slices in a cloth, and then\nheat your gridiron, and broil them over a clear fire.\n\nIf you have cold boiled ham, it is better for broiling than that which\nis raw; and being boiled, will require no soaking before you put it on\nthe gridiron.\n\nIf you wish to serve up eggs with the ham, put some lard into a very\nclean frying-pan, and make it boiling hot. Break the eggs separately\ninto a saucer, that in case a bad one should be among them it may not\nmix with the rest. Slip each egg gently into the frying-pan. Do not\nturn them while they are frying, but keep pouring some of the hot lard\nover them with an iron spoon; this will do them sufficiently on the\nupper side. They will be done enough in about three minutes; the white\nmust retain its transparency so that the yolk will be seen through it.\nWhen done, take them up with a tin slice, drain off the lard, and if\nany part of the white is discoloured or ragged, trim it off. Lay a\nfried egg upon each slice of the broiled ham, and send them to table\nhot.\n\nThis is a much nicer way than the common practice of frying the ham or\nbacon with the eggs. Some persons broil or fry the ham without eggs,\nand send it to table cut into little slips or mouthfuls.\n\nTo curl small pieces of ham for garnishing, slice as thin as possible\nsome that has been boiled or parboiled. The pieces should be about two\ninches square. Roll it up round little wooden skewers, and put it into\na cheese toaster, or into a tin oven, and set it before the fire for\neight or ten minutes. When it is done, slip out the skewers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 9101_toboilfreshmeat.txt                 | 15.34961 | 0.9999871 | To Boil Fresh Meat.\n\nIn boiling fresh meat, care is necessary to have the water boiling all\nthe time it is in the pot; if the pot is not well scummed, the\nappearance of the meat will be spoiled.\n\nMutton and beef are preferred, by some, a little rare; but pork and veal\nshould always be well done. A round of beef that is stuffed, will take\nmore than three hours to boil, and if not stuffed, two hours or more,\naccording to the size; slow boiling is the best. A leg of mutton\nrequires from two to three hours boiling, according to the size; a\nfore-quarter from an hour to an hour and a half; a quarter of lamb,\nunless, very large, will boil in an hour. Veal and pork will take rather\nlonger to boil than mutton.\n\nAll boiled fresh meat should have drawn butter poured over it, after it\nis dished, and be garnished with parsley.\n\nThe liquor that fresh meat, or poultry, is boiled in, should be saved,\nas an addition of vegetables, herbs, and dumplings make a nourishing\nsoup of it.\n\nA large turkey will take three hours to boil--a small one half that\ntime; secure the legs to keep them from bursting out; turkeys should be\nblanched in warm milk and water; stuff them and rub their breasts with\nbutter, flour a cloth and pin them in. A large chicken that is stuffed\nshould boil an hour, and small ones half that time. The water should\nalways boil before you put in your meat or poultry. When meat is\nfrozen, soak it in cold water for several hours, and allow more time in\nthe cooking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| 9624_greenpeassoup.txt                   | 15.08240 | 0.9999832 | GREEN PEAS SOUP.\n\nTake four pounds of knuckle of veal, and a pound of bacon.

Then put it into a\ntureen, and send it to table.\n\nNever use hard old green peas for this soup, or for any other purpose.\nWhen they begin to turn yellow, it is time to leave them off for the\nseason.\n\nLima bean soup may be made in the same manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| 9624_doughnuts.txt                       | 14.85208 | 0.9999788 | DOUGH NUTS.\n\nTake two deep dishes, and sift three quarters of a pound of flour into\neach.

Put it into a tea-cup, pour on it\nsufficient lukewarm water to cover it, and let it soak all night, or at\nleast several hours. Take a quart of milk, which must be made warm, but\nnot boiling. Stir the rennet-water into it. Cover it, and set it in a\nwarm place. When the curd has become quite firm, and the whey looks\ngreenish, drain off the whey, and set the curd in a cool place. While\nthe milk is turning, prepare the other ingredients. Wash and dry half a\npound of currants, and dredge them well with flour. Blanch three ounces\nof sweet and one ounce of bitter almonds, by scalding and peeling them.\nThen cool them in cold water, wiping them dry before you put them into\nthe mortar. If you cannot procure bitter almonds, peach kernels may be\nsubstituted. Beat them, one at a time, in the mortar to a smooth paste,\npouring in with every one a few drops of rose water to prevent their\nbeing oily, dull-coloured, and heavy. If you put a sufficiency of rose\nwater, the pounded almond paste will be light, creamy, and perfectly\nwhite. Mix, as you do them, the sweet and bitter almonds together. Then\nbeat the yolks of eight eggs, and when light, mix them gradually with\nthe curd. Add five table-spoonfuls of cream, and a tea-spoonful of\nmixed spice. Lastly, stir in, by degrees, the pounded almonds, and the\ncurrants alternately. Stir the whole mixture very hard. Bake it in\nbuttered dishes, laying puff paste round the edges.

If properly managed, the gooseberries will keep a year, and may\nbe used at any time, by stewing them with sugar.\n\nYou may bottle damsons in the same manner; also grapes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| 9624_indiancorn.txt                | 5.6508604 | 0.82664121 | INDIAN CORN.\n\nCorn for boiling should be full grown but young and tender.

You must wipe\nevery piece well, to dry it from the blood and moisture. To fifty\npounds of meat allow two pounds and a quarter of coarse salt, two\npounds and a quarter of fine salt, one ounce and a half of saltpetre,\none pound and a half of brown sugar, and one quart of molasses. Mix all\nthese ingredients well together, boil and skim it for about twenty\nminutes, and when no more scum rises, take it from the fire. Have ready\nthe beef in a large tub, or in a barrel; pour the brine gradually upon\nit with a ladle, and as it cools rub it well into every part of the\nmeat. A molasses hogshead sawed in two is a good receptacle for pickled\nmeat. Cover it well with a thick cloth, and look at it frequently,\nskimming off whatever may float on the top, and basting the meat with\nthe brine. In about a fortnight the beef will be fit for use.\n\nTongues may be put into the same cask with the beef, one or two at a\ntime, as you procure them from the butcher. None of them will be ready\nfor smoking in less than six weeks; but they had best remain in pickle\ntwo or three months. They should not be sent to the smoke-house later\nthan March. If you do them at home, they will require three weeks’\nsmoking over a wood fire. Hang them with the root or large end upwards.\nWhen done, sew up each tongue tightly in coarse linen, and hang them up\nin a dark dry cellar.\n\nPickled tongues without smoking are seldom liked.\n\nThe last of October is a good time for putting meat into pickle. If the\nweather is too warm or too cold, it will not take the salt well.\n\nIn the course of the winter the pickle may probably require a second\nboiling with additional ingredients.\n\nHalf an ounce of pearl-ash added to the other articles will make the\nmeat more tender, but many persons thinks it injures the taste.\n\nThe meat must always be kept completely immersed in the brine. To\neffect this a heavy board should be laid upon it. |\n| 9101_spicedbeefintheirishstyle.txt | 4.8443279 | 0.68037046 | Spiced Beef in the Irish Style.\n\nTo a round weighing from twenty to twenty-five pounds, take a pint of\nsalt, one ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of pepper, two ounces of\ncloves, one ounce of allspice, four ounces of brown sugar, all well\npulverized, and mixed together; rub the round well with it, and lay it\nin a small tub or vessel by itself. Turn and rub it once a day for ten\ndays. It will not injure if it remain a week longer in the spices, if it\nshould not be convenient to bake it.

Take a sufficient\nquantity of grated stale bread, and mix it with sage and sweet marjoram\nrubbed fine or powdered; also some grated lemon-peel. Season it with\npepper, salt, powdered nutmeg and mace; mix in butter enough to moisten\nit, and some beaten yolk of egg to bind it. Let the whole be very well\nincorporated.\n\nThe pig should be newly killed, (that morning if possible,) nicely\ncleaned, fat, and not too large. Wash it well in cold water, and cut\noff the feet close to the joints, leaving some skin all round to fold\nover the ends. Take out the liver and heart, and reserve them, with the\nfeet, to make the gravy. Truss back the legs. Fill the body with the\nstuffing (it must be quite full) and then sew it up, or tie it round\nwith a buttered twine. Put the pig on the spit, and place it before a\nclear brisk fire, but not too near lest it scorch. The fire should be\nlargest at the ends, that the middle of the pig may not be done before\nthe extremities. If you find the heat too great in the centre, you may\ndiminish it by placing a flat-iron before the fire. When you first put\nit down, wash the pig all over with salt and water; afterwards rub it\nfrequently with a feather dipped in sweet oil, or with fresh butter\ntied in a rag. If you baste it with any thing else, or with its own\ndripping, the skin will not be crisp. Take care not to blister or burn\nthe outside by keeping it too near the fire. A good sized pig will\nrequire at least three hours’ roasting.\n\nUnless a pig is very small it is seldom sent to table whole. Take the\nspit from the fire, and place it across a large dish: then, having cut\noff the head with a sharp knife, and cut down the back, slip the spit\nout. Lay the two halves of the body close together in the dish, and\nplace half the head on each side. Garnish with sliced lemon.\n\nFor the gravy,—take, that from the dripping-pan and skim it well.\nHaving boiled the heart, liver, and feet, with some minced sage in a\nvery little water, cut the meat from the feet, and chop it. Chop also\nthe liver and heart. Put all into a small sauce-pan, adding a little of\nthe water that they were boiled in, and some bits of butter rolled in\nflour. Flavour it with a glass of Madeira, and some grated nutmeg. Give\nit a boil up, and send it to table in a gravy-boat.\n\nYou may serve up with the pig, apple-sauce, cranberry sauce, or\nbread-sauce in a small tureen; or currant jelly.\n\nIf you bake the pig instead of roasting it, rub it from time to time\nwith fresh butter tied in a rag.\\\\\n\t 9624\\_cantelopesormuskmelons.txt          & 22.38101 & 1.0000000 & CANTELOPES OR MUSK-MELONS.\n\nTake very small cantelopes before they are ripe. Shave a thin paring\noff the whole outside. Cut out a small piece or plug about an inch\nsquare, and through it extract all the seeds, \\&c. from the middle.\nThen, return the plugs to the hole from whence you took them, and\nsecure them with a needle and thread, or by tying a small string round\nthe cantelope.\n\nLay the cantelopes for four or five hours in salt and water. Then put\nthem into spring water to extract the salt, changing the water till you\nfind it salt no longer. Scald them in weak alum-water. Make a syrup in\nthe proportion of a pint of water to a pound of loaf-sugar, and boil\nthe cantelopes in it till a straw will go through them. Then take them\nout, and set them in the sun to harden.\n\nPrepare some fine ripe oranges, paring off the yellow rind very thin,\nand cutting it into slips, and then laying it in scalding water to\nextract the bitterness. Cut the oranges into pieces; allow a pint of\nwater to each orange, and boil them to a pulp. Afterwards strain them,\nand allow to each pint of the liquid, a pound of the best loaf-sugar,\nand stir in a little beaten white of egg; one white to four pounds of\nsugar. This is for the second syrup. Boil the peel in it, skimming it\nwell. When the peel is soft, take it all out; for if left among the\ncantelopes, it will communicate to it too strong a taste of the orange.\n\nPut the cantelopes into your jars, and pour over them the hot syrup.\nCover them closely, and keep them in a dry cool place.\n\nLarge cantelopes may be prepared for preserving (after you have taken\noff the outer rind) by cutting them into pieces according to the\nnatural divisions with which they are fluted. This receipt for\npreserving cantelopes whole, will do very well for green lemons or\nlimes, substituting lemon-peel and lemon-juice for that of oranges in\nthe second syrup.\n\nYou may use some of the first syrup to boil up the pulp of the orange\nor lemons that has been left. It will make a sort of marmalade, that is\nvery good for colds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\\\\n\t 9624\\_pickledporkandpeasepudding.txt      & 20.02492 & 0.9999999 & PICKLED PORK AND PEASE PUDDING.\n\nSoak the pork all night in cold water, and wash and scrape it clean.\nPut it on early in the day, as it will take a long time to boil, and\nmust boil slowly. Skim it frequently. Boil in a separate pot greens or\ncabbage to eat with it; also parsnips and potatoes.\n\nPease pudding is a frequent accompaniment to pickled pork, and is very\ngenerally liked. To make a small pudding, you must have ready a quart\nof dried split pease, which have been soaked all night in cold water.\nTie them in a cloth, (leaving room for them to swell,) and boil them\nslowly till they are tender. Drain them, and rub them through a\ncullender or a sieve into a deep dish; season them with pepper and\nsalt, and mix with them an ounce of butter, and two beaten eggs. Beat\nall well together till thoroughly mixed. Dip a clean cloth in hot\nwater, sprinkle it with flour, and put the pudding into it. Tie it up\nvery tightly, leaving a small space between the mixture and the tying,\n(as the pudding will still swell a little,) and boil it an hour longer.\nSend it to table and eat it with the pork.\n\nYou may make a pease pudding in a plain and less delicate way, by\nsimply seasoning the pease with pepper and salt, (having first soaked\nthem well,) tying them in a cloth, and putting them to boil in the same\npot with the pork, taking care to make the string very tight, so that\nthe water may not get in. When all is done, and you turn out the\npudding, cut it into thick slices and lay it round the pork.\n\nPickled pork is frequently accompanied by dried beans and hominy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\\\\n\t 9624\\_preservedraspberries.txt            & 19.87525 & 0.9999999 & PRESERVED RASPBERRIES.\n\nTake a quantity of ripe raspberries, and set aside the half, selecting\nfor that purpose the largest and firmest. Then put the remainder into\nyour preserving pan, mash them, and set them over the fire. As soon as\nthey have come to a boil, take them out, let them cool, and then\nsqueeze them through a bag.\n\nWhile they are cooling, prepare your sugar, which must be fine loaf.\nAllow a pound of sugar to every quart of whole raspberries. Having\nwashed the kettle clean, put the sugar into it, allowing half a pint of\ncold water to two pounds of sugar. When it has melted in the water, put\nit on the fire, and boil it till the scum ceases to rise, and it is a\nthick syrup; taking care to skim it well.

Boil for five or six minutes sufficient of the best vinegar\nto cover the cucumbers well; putting into the kettle a thin muslin bag\nfilled with cloves, mace, and mustard seed. Pour the vinegar scalding\nhot into the jar of pickles, which should be secured with a large flat\ncork, and an oil-cloth or leather cover tied over it. Another way to\ngreen pickles is to cover them with vine leaves or cabbage leaves, and\nto keep them on a warm, hearth pouring boiling water on them five or\nsix times a day; renewing the water as soon as it becomes cold.\n\nIn proportioning the spice to the vinegar, allow to every two quarts,\nan ounce of mace, two dozen cloves, and two ounces of mustard seed. You\nmay leave the muslin bag, with the spice, for about a week in the\npickle jar to heighten the flavour, if you think it necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n\t 9624\\_toroastaturkey.txt                  & 15.92240 & 0.9999927 & TO ROAST A TURKEY.\n\nMake a force-meat of grated bread-crumbs, minced suet, sweet marjoram,\ngrated lemon-peel, nutmeg, pepper, salt, and beaten yolk of egg. You\nmay add some grated cold ham. Light some writing paper, and singe the\nhairs from the skin of the turkey. Reserve the neck, liver, and gizzard\nfor the gravy. Stuff the craw of the turkey with the force-meat, of\nwhich there should be enough made to form into balls for frying, laying\nthem round the turkey when it is dished. Dredge it with flour, and\nroast it before a clear brisk fire, basting it with cold lard. Towards\nthe last, set the turkey nearer to the fire, dredge it again very\nlightly with flour, and baste it with butter. It will require,\naccording to its size, from two to three hours roasting.\n\nMake the gravy of the giblets cut in pieces, seasoned, and stewed for\ntwo hours in a very little water; thicken it with a spoonful of browned\nflour, and stir into it the gravy from the dripping-pan, having first\nskimmed off the fat.\n\nA turkey should be accompanied by ham or tongue. Serve up with it\nmushroom-sauce. Have stewed cranberries on the table to eat with it. Do\nnot help any one to the legs, or drum-sticks as they are called.\n\nTurkeys are sometimes stuffed entirely with sausage-meat. Small cakes\nof this meat should then be fried, and laid round it.\n\nTo bone a turkey, you must begin with a very sharp knife at the top of\nthe wings, and scrape the flesh loose from the bone without dividing or\ncutting it to pieces. If done carefully and dexterously, the whole mass\nof flesh may be separated from the bone, so that you can take hold of\nthe head and draw out the entire skeleton at once. A large quantity of\nforce-meat having been prepared, stuff it hard into the turkey,\nrestoring it by doing so to its natural form, filling out the body,\nbreast, wings and legs, so as to resemble their original shape when the\nbones were in. Roast or bake it; pouring a glass of port wine into the\ngravy. A boned turkey is frequently served up cold, covered with lumps\nof currant jelly; slices of which are laid round the dish.\n\nAny sort of poultry or game may be boned and stuffed in the same\nmanner,\n\nA cold turkey that has not been boned is sometimes sent to table larded\nall over the breast with slips of fat bacon, drawn through the flesh\nwith a larding needle, and arranged in regular form.                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n\t 9624\\_broiledham.txt                      & 15.42338 & 0.9999880 & BROILED HAM.\n\nCut the ham into very thin slices, (the thinner the better.) Soak them\nin hot water at least half an hour, (a whole hour is better,) to draw\nout some of the salt; changing the water several times, and always\npouring it on scalding hot. This process will not only extract the\nsuperfluous salt (which would otherwise ooze out in broiling and remain\nsticking about the surface of the meat) but it makes the ham more\ntender and mellow. After soaking, dry the slices in a cloth, and then\nheat your gridiron, and broil them over a clear fire.\n\nIf you have cold boiled ham, it is better for broiling than that which\nis raw; and being boiled, will require no soaking before you put it on\nthe gridiron.\n\nIf you wish to serve up eggs with the ham, put some lard into a very\nclean frying-pan, and make it boiling hot. Break the eggs separately\ninto a saucer, that in case a bad one should be among them it may not\nmix with the rest. Slip each egg gently into the frying-pan. Do not\nturn them while they are frying, but keep pouring some of the hot lard\nover them with an iron spoon; this will do them sufficiently on the\nupper side. They will be done enough in about three minutes; the white\nmust retain its transparency so that the yolk will be seen through it.\nWhen done, take them up with a tin slice, drain off the lard, and if\nany part of the white is discoloured or ragged, trim it off. Lay a\nfried egg upon each slice of the broiled ham, and send them to table\nhot.\n\nThis is a much nicer way than the common practice of frying the ham or\nbacon with the eggs. Some persons broil or fry the ham without eggs,\nand send it to table cut into little slips or mouthfuls.\n\nTo curl small pieces of ham for garnishing, slice as thin as possible\nsome that has been boiled or parboiled. The pieces should be about two\ninches square. Roll it up round little wooden skewers, and put it into\na cheese toaster, or into a tin oven, and set it before the fire for\neight or ten minutes. When it is done, slip out the skewers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\\\\n\t 9101\\_toboilfreshmeat.txt                 & 15.34961 & 0.9999871 & To Boil Fresh Meat.\n\nIn boiling fresh meat, care is necessary to have the water boiling all\nthe time it is in the pot; if the pot is not well scummed, the\nappearance of the meat will be spoiled.\n\nMutton and beef are preferred, by some, a little rare; but pork and veal\nshould always be well done. A round of beef that is stuffed, will take\nmore than three hours to boil, and if not stuffed, two hours or more,\naccording to the size; slow boiling is the best. A leg of mutton\nrequires from two to three hours boiling, according to the size; a\nfore-quarter from an hour to an hour and a half; a quarter of lamb,\nunless, very large, will boil in an hour. Veal and pork will take rather\nlonger to boil than mutton.\n\nAll boiled fresh meat should have drawn butter poured over it, after it\nis dished, and be garnished with parsley.\n\nThe liquor that fresh meat, or poultry, is boiled in, should be saved,\nas an addition of vegetables, herbs, and dumplings make a nourishing\nsoup of it.\n\nA large turkey will take three hours to boil--a small one half that\ntime; secure the legs to keep them from bursting out; turkeys should be\nblanched in warm milk and water; stuff them and rub their breasts with\nbutter, flour a cloth and pin them in. A large chicken that is stuffed\nshould boil an hour, and small ones half that time. The water should\nalways boil before you put in your meat or poultry.

While\nthe milk is turning, prepare the other ingredients. Wash and dry half a\npound of currants, and dredge them well with flour. Blanch three ounces\nof sweet and one ounce of bitter almonds, by scalding and peeling them.\nThen cool them in cold water, wiping them dry before you put them into\nthe mortar. If you cannot procure bitter almonds, peach kernels may be\nsubstituted. Beat them, one at a time, in the mortar to a smooth paste,\npouring in with every one a few drops of rose water to prevent their\nbeing oily, dull-coloured, and heavy. If you put a sufficiency of rose\nwater, the pounded almond paste will be light, creamy, and perfectly\nwhite. Mix, as you do them, the sweet and bitter almonds together. Then\nbeat the yolks of eight eggs, and when light, mix them gradually with\nthe curd. Add five table-spoonfuls of cream, and a tea-spoonful of\nmixed spice. Lastly, stir in, by degrees, the pounded almonds, and the\ncurrants alternately. Stir the whole mixture very hard. Bake it in\nbuttered dishes, laying puff paste round the edges. If accurately made,\nit will be found delicious.

If properly managed, the gooseberries will keep a year, and may\nbe used at any time, by stewing them with sugar.\n\nYou may bottle damsons in the same manner; also grapes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n\t 9624\\_indiancorn.txt                & 5.6508604 & 0.82664121 & INDIAN CORN.\n\nCorn for boiling should be full grown but young and tender.

You must wipe\nevery piece well, to dry it from the blood and moisture. To fifty\npounds of meat allow two pounds and a quarter of coarse salt, two\npounds and a quarter of fine salt, one ounce and a half of saltpetre,\none pound and a half of brown sugar, and one quart of molasses. Mix all\nthese ingredients well together, boil and skim it for about twenty\nminutes, and when no more scum rises, take it from the fire. Have ready\nthe beef in a large tub, or in a barrel; pour the brine gradually upon\nit with a ladle, and as it cools rub it well into every part of the\nmeat. A molasses hogshead sawed in two is a good receptacle for pickled\nmeat. Cover it well with a thick cloth, and look at it frequently,\nskimming off whatever may float on the top, and basting the meat with\nthe brine. In about a fortnight the beef will be fit for use.\n\nTongues may be put into the same cask with the beef, one or two at a\ntime, as you procure them from the butcher. None of them will be ready\nfor smoking in less than six weeks; but they had best remain in pickle\ntwo or three months. They should not be sent to the smoke-house later\nthan March. If you do them at home, they will require three weeks’\nsmoking over a wood fire. Hang them with the root or large end upwards.\nWhen done, sew up each tongue tightly in coarse linen, and hang them up\nin a dark dry cellar.\n\nPickled tongues without smoking are seldom liked.\n\nThe last of October is a good time for putting meat into pickle. If the\nweather is too warm or too cold, it will not take the salt well.\n\nIn the course of the winter the pickle may probably require a second\nboiling with additional ingredients.\n\nHalf an ounce of pearl-ash added to the other articles will make the\nmeat more tender, but many persons thinks it injures the taste.\n\nThe meat must always be kept completely immersed in the brine. To\neffect this a heavy board should be laid upon it.\\\\\n\t 9101\\_spicedbeefintheirishstyle.txt & 4.8443279 & 0.68037046 & Spiced Beef in the Irish Style.\n\nTo a round weighing from twenty to twenty-five pounds, take a pint of\nsalt, one ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of pepper, two ounces of\ncloves, one ounce of allspice, four ounces of brown sugar, all well\npulverized, and mixed together; rub the round well with it, and lay it\nin a small tub or vessel by itself.

        "Finally, we can use our model to predict which texts in our unclassified data are most likely to be recipes. Note that this kind of classifier doesn't make a binary (i.e. yes/no) decision about whether a text belongs to the model category. Instead, it assigns a probability that it does, based on the choices we made constructing the training set and the model. If you rerun the code above, even starting with the exact same corpus of recipes, you will see slightly different results because the step that separates the training data from the testing data is randomized, meaning precisely which texts the model trains on will be different each time the code is run. Since we know that all the hand-tagged recipes _are_ recipes, we would not expect to see radically different probabilities, but they will vary because the exact words in the training set will shift from run to run, at least in the way I've set up this code."

        "For me, an experiment like this raises important questions about the _aims_ of computational classification for particular scholars and projects. If your aim is to create a statistically valid model of \"recipeness\" that is robust across many datasets, this method likely does not meet that goal. However, if the aim is—as it was for Avery—finding likely recipes, and recipe-adjacent texts, from within a large corpus of unknown texts, this method might be precisely what is needed. To put this another way, there is research where the development of the algorithm is the primary aim, and research where the algorithm is employed to explore the data in new ways—as when [Lauren Klein described topic modeling](http://lklein.com/archives/the-carework-and-codework-of-the-digital-humanities/) as \"a techique that stirs the archive.\" You will find, I suspect, that the unknown newspaper texts assigned the highest liklihood to belong to the recipe category are, overall, either culinary or follow a similar instructional structure to recipes. If our goal is to find culinary writing in the mass of unstructured newspaper reprints, this technique perhaps fits the bill.\n",

        "In this example of genre classification, we trained one genre—recipes—and then compared our unknown texts to that model to see how likely they were to be recipes. Because classification models like these return a probability, however, there is no reason you cannot compare the same texts to multiple genre models. One text may seem 75% likely to be a recipe, but also 60% likely to be news. [This notebook uses topics as features for classification](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19FriuULPYgJDtZRS42o4meMbYnZ0ezYX?usp=sharing) and builds models of six different genres—advertisements, news, fiction, information, poetry, and recipes. It then assigns a probability for each genre to each unknown text, so that a single text might have some probability of belonging to multiple genres. While this might seem confusing, I actually find this aspect of classification reassuringly contextual and defensible from a humanistic perspective. We know that genres bleed into one another, and that the lines between them are rarely as bright and fixed as a catalog or index might imply. Allowing researchers to navigate multiple possibilities, at varying degrees of certainty, supports the inductive research methods preferred by humanities scholars through a computational model. "
